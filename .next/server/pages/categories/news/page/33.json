Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 joined the initial call to strike from the Service and Patient Care Workers of the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kathryn Lybarger, president of AFSCME Local 3299 chapter, said in the press release that UC administration continuously overlooks the needs of workers at the campuses and is evasive about their outsourcing agenda. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California has bypassed its workers at every turn, refusing to meet and confer about plans to outsource some of the last middle-class jobs in California to poverty wage contractor,” Lybarger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME Local 3299 is responsible for representing over 24,000 employees across the UC system.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union alleges that the UC has been responsible for “years of scandal,” namely income inequality and “illegal intimidation tactics.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The press release also claims that administrators at UC Davis are refusing to comply with demands to stop outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rather than arranging for UC’s current Patient Care workers to operate the new site, UC plans to eliminate those UC jobs and insists that workers should lose their employment benefits and reapply to work at the new facility,” the press release said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Doan, a spokesperson for the UC Office of the President, said AFSCME’s claims are unfounded and calls for attention. Doan also cited an AFSCME-led </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/afscme-calls-for-boycott-of-commencement-speakers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boycott</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of commencement speakers last month, during which the union called for workers to protest events featuring speakers such as former First Lady Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear AFSCME leaders are going to desperate lengths for attention, from sporadically announcing baseless accusations against the university to calling for a boycott of commencement speakers that squarely hurts students and their families,” Doan said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doan added that UC health and service workers receive fair compensation and benefits for their work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC already pays AFSCME patient care and service workers at or above market rates, with excellent health insurance and generous retirement benefits,” Doan said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lybarger expressed her discontent with the UC system, accusing it of siding with the most economical option, a decision that she said negatively affects union employees who risk having their jobs outsourced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC administrators have opted for a publicly financed race to the bottom, which will come at the expense of patients, students, families, and our communities,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The May 16 strike will take place throughout the entire state on all 10 UC campuses and at all five medical campuses.

Signa filed his own lawsuit against former UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson in November 2018. <em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit makes several allegations against current and former members of UCPD, including former Chief of Police Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief of Police Cathy Farley, Lieutenant David Millard, Lieutenant Mark Signa, Lieutenant Robert Romero, Officer Tiffany Little, Officer Michael Little and Officer Ryan Hashimoto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges Smith was consistently retaliated against by UCPD staff for bringing attention to concerning practices and behaviors within the department. Some of Smith’s concerns included alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, of fellow officers and of sexual assault and rape victims, as well as falsifying sexual assault reports and racial discrimination. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit is the most recent of the three to be filed. It alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the plaintiff in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">case against UCPD filed in November 2018, consistently retaliated against Smith. Smith allegedly brought repeated grievances about Lieutenant Signa and other officers’ behavior to former Chief Olson, but court documents state Smith “has continued to be the target of harassment and retaliation” – even after resigning from the department in November 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, court documents allege that Smith participated in a “Good Ole Boys’ Club” within the department, which allegedly fostered and condoned misconduct, favoritism, harassment and retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final of the three suits filed against UCPD since November is from Officers Tiffany and Michael Little, spouses working within the department. According to court documents, in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Little v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the pair alleged that they were retaliated against after reporting Smith for allegedly having an extramarital affair with a subordinate officer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three cases referenced specific events in which the officers were both involved but alleged different circumstances and details on what exactly happened. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the most recent case filed, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. UCPD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Smith alleges that Officer Signa, Officers Tiffany and Michael Little and Officer Hashimoto “engaged in relentless acts of defamation of character and false light” and “have created and promoted a narrative within the UCPD and surrounding law enforcement agencies” about Smith’s resignation and integrity as an officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case also alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the Littles and other officers “conspired” against Smith by making a personnel complaint against him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith resigned near the end of 2017 due to alleged “ongoing harassment and retaliation” and UCSB’s “inaction” in response to the conduct, court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegations in Smith’s case against UCPD date back to 2014, shortly after Smith was hired in the department, according to court documents. Below are the specific allegations the case makes against individual UCPD officers and the department as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lieutenant Mark Signa </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents allege that since the start of Smith’s employment in August 2012, a group of officers have “consistently failed to leave the station for nearly entire shifts and spent most nights at the station playing video games, watching movies, and/or browsing the internet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa allegedly participated in these activities and showed “inappropriate ‘Youtube’ videos to the squad.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sergeant, Smith allegedly “gave clear directives that officers were to stay out of the station, not to watch TV or movies or play video games on duty,” court documents state. In response, Lieutenant Signa allegedly “scoffed” at Smith’s directives and posted “multiple colored photocopies of [World War II-era] General Patton throughout [the] station” with Smith’s name on them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly requested multiple trainings in the time span between 2015 and 2017, but “Signa denied all of these requests, while consistently allowing other sergeants to attend courses,” court documents allege. When Smith asked about this, Lieutenant Signa allegedly said Smith was “developed enough” and that the “Department did not need to spend any money” on Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around April 2015, amid “scrutiny regarding the handling of sexual assault cases,” the department allegedly took reports in which “males were being listed as rape and sexual assault suspects, despite no evidence of a crime occurring,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The department also allegedly took reports “where victim’s statements were being exaggerated to meet elements of a crime.” Signa allegedly ordered that officers continue “classifying all males as suspects in any sex-related case, whether or not a crime had occurred.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly expressed concern that this practice was “libelous” and did not adhere to “standard and appropriate law enforcement procedures, and potentially violated due process.” Signa allegedly “became upset” with Smith and told him to “let the district attorney figure out who is guilty and who is not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa also allegedly said “UCPD could not afford the political scrutiny.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD members also allegedly created a “secret log” for sexual or domestic violence cases, which all officers in the department had access to. Officers were allegedly “not to disclose knowledge of this log within their reports to avoid discovery.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported concerns of the secret log to Olson and Farley. Olson allegedly said he would “look into” the concerns. Court documents say this secret log still exists within the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of 2016, Signa allegedly ordered Smith to continue training “an African American officer, despite the fact that the Officer was not meeting the training standards.” Signa allegedly said “it was a politically sensitive matter because the officer was black,” citing Olson’s desire for greater diversity in the department. Smith allegedly reported Signa’s statements to UCPD staff, but no action was taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2017, Smith was allegedly assigned to a “mutual aid response” at UC Berkeley for the upcoming campus appearance from Milo Yiannopoulos. While at the event, UC Berkeley police officers allegedly “refused to allow the officers assisting from various U.C. Police Departments” to intervene with “students and civilians [who] were being brutally beaten by the anarchists.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the events at UC Berkeley and his concerns to Olson and was questioned by Olson upon his return from UC Berkeley. Olson allegedly “received a call from U.C. Berkeley Police Chief Margo Bennett,” who yelled at Olson and was “furious” with Smith for voicing concerns regarding the Milo Yiannopoulos event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further incidents regarding Signa can be viewed on pages 5 through 10 of the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Ryan Hashimoto </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Smith served as sergeant for UCPD, he allegedly “reported several violations of policy and law to Signa,” which continued to create points of retaliation against Smith. Some of those violations pertained to Officer Hashimoto’s alleged misconduct in the office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto allegedly “made multiple cartoon videos” of officers, crime victims, citizens, university officials and employees in which he “used his own voice to play the character of each person.” At times, the videos “were discriminatory toward several protected classes of persons.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto allegedly created a video depicting an officer in the department – referred to as “Officer M” in the complaint – who was known to allegedly contact “female sexual assault victims unsolicited,” as well as sexual assault advocates from the Women’s Center. The video allegedly “depicts the advocates yelling ‘Rape!’ at the victims and forcing the victims to make sexual assault reports.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly reported Officer M to Signa after Smith discovered that “Officer M was having sexual assault advocates call his personal phone directly to report cases” without notifying a dispatch or supervisor. Smith ordered Officer M to stop this practice. UCPD allegedly took no action regarding Officer M.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto’s alleged videos also depicted Chancellor Yang with Officer Hashimoto using a “Chinese accent, making derogatory and inappropriate statements.” Hashimoto also allegedly mocked an African-American dispatcher through “videos and in person impersonations.” Hashimoto’s alleged impersonations of the dispatcher included mockery of the dispatcher “speaking and eating food.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On another occasion, Hashimoto allegedly acted out “a fictional situation where the dispatcher was playing with a large black dildo that Hashimoto named ‘King Kong Dong.’” Officer Hashimoto allegedly “often walked into different areas of the UCPD and would yell ‘King Kong Dong’ while impersonating the dispatchers voice. He would position his forearm in front of his groin area, and then slap his arm on desktops as if he was slapping a dildo on the desktop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto also allegedly “inappropriately joked” and stated to UCPD staff “that the victim in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/rape-2014-daniel-chen-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Chen rape and kidnap case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contracted herpes from the suspect,” while UCPD was conducting the investigation. Officer Hashimoto allegedly “mocked the victim’s Asian accent, and in the accent stated: ‘I have herpes on my pussy.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2018, while Smith was working in Montecito following the Thomas Fire and the Montecito mudslides, he was shown a recording allegedly made by Hashimoto in which Hashimoto was verbally “mocking an evidence video and audio recording” related to the sexual assault, sodomy, kidnapping and robbery case of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/trial-for-iv-menus-owner-will-begin-in-late-july/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">v.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Patrick Galoustian</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this video – a tape of Galoustian allegedly “sexual[ly] assaulting a transvestite victim” – Hashimoto allegedly mocked Galoustian’s accent in a voice-over, made sexual references to the victim and made “statements in essence of rubbing their (Galoustian and the trans victim’s penis’ together).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the video to UCPD on Jan. 27, 2018. At the time, Olson and Lieutenant Millard allegedly confirmed that they were “aware of the recording.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Tiffany Little and Officer Michael Little </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also reported alleged misconduct from married UCPD officers Tiffany and Michael Little, who “frequently left their assigned patrol areas while on duty and traveled to their personal residence in Goleta using UCPD vehicles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Littles would also allegedly “stay at their residences for extended periods of time, fail to answer calls for service, and ask other officers to handle calls for service for them.” The suit alleges that the Littles’ actions “are a violation of policy and a theft of funds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court documents, Officer Michael Little also allegedly “talked about his fantasy to have a black man try to steal his wallet so he can ‘fucking shoot him in the fucking face.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Michael Little allegedly approached Smith and other officers and “related a fictitious story about how he (Little) is walking through a parking lot and a black man approaches him and tries to rob him of his wallet. Little would then mimic responding by stating, ‘How about I shoot you in the fucking face!’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would then allegedly “slightly draw his firearm from the holster as if he was going to draw his weapon” while reciting the story. Little allegedly “acted out this fantasy, by telling the story” while he was instructing at the firing range and “fir[ed] his duty weapon multiple times” at the shooting target. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported Little’s actions to Signa, but “Signa dismissed the claims against Michael Little and Hashimoto as ‘blowing off steam.’” The suit alleges that “Signa deliberately failed to take any action to further investigate the claims against Tiffany Little because of his personal relationships with these officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit further alleges that “Signa conspired with Michael Little, Tiffany Little, and Hashimoto to knowingly file false accusations of misconduct against [Smith] in the form of a personnel complaint,” resulting in an Internal Affairs investigation into Smith and an administrative leave that lasted over a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly “requested an internal investigation into the false accusations made against him.” As of late March 2019, UCPD has allegedly “failed to investigate the officers who made false allegations against” Smith, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Smith’s resignation at the end of 2017, Signa allegedly told UCPD staff that Smith resigned “in bad standing, to avoid termination.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly demanded “for the harassment, retaliation, and first amendment violations to cease, no less than ten times since his departure from UCPD” in person to Olson, Farley and Lieutenant Millard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the university allegedly “hired an attorney to investigate” Smith’s complaints, the Littles allegedly “briefed and debriefed several individuals before and after interviews” relating to the investigation and “attempted to recruit members of UCPD” to make complaints against Lieutenant Millard and Olson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Smith “continues to suffer losses in earnings and other employment benefits as well as past and future non-economic injury.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Horton, Smith’s lawyer, wrote in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith attempted to address significant misconduct relating to Lt.

These individuals have responded by attempting to destroy Mr. Smith’s personal and professional reputation.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Smith was forced to take legal action after the University did not take any corrective action against the aforementioned individuals,” Horton said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the university “is undertaking a thorough review” of allegations and that they expect the police department “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to adhere to the highest of standards.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A case management conference for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is scheduled for Wednesday, July 31 at 8:30 a.m. </span></p>\n<p>The court documents in full can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019_03_27_JOHN-DOE_COMPLAINT-FOR-DAMAGES.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Other officers also allegedly “confided” their concerns about Smith in Signa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa expressed concern about the “impropriety” of favoritism in the department and was later allegedly retaliated against at a lunch in or around August 2016.

Shortly after, UCSB Employee &amp; Labor Relations Specialist Jessica Graham allegedly contacted Signa and said she would update him on the status of the complaint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of November 2018, Signa had not heard back from either Señeriz or Graham, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 19, 2018, Signa submitted two whistleblower complaints to UCSB, but had not heard back as of November 2018 when he filed the lawsuit against the UC Police Department.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that more UCPD officers also submitted whistleblower complaints similar to Signa’s.

Bike Committee worked with Bike Committee Senate Liaison and On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal to develop the resolution.</p>\n<p>The resolution includes a letter written by the Associated Students (A.S.) Bike Committee, which oversees maintenance of campus bicycle infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The letter criticizes the lack of bicycle parking and infrastructure in the newest design plan for the Student Resource Building (SRB) North Landscaping Design Project. The development plan for the lawn area north of the SRB and south of the bike path would provide more space in the SRB and expand outdoor study space, according to the letter.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s vote is in solidarity with the A.S. Bike Committee’s letter, and directs the SRB Governance Board to consider their request to put the project on hold until the design includes improvements to the SRB’s bicycle system.</p>\n<p>The resolution emphasizes how the current bicycle parking situation at the SRB threatens the safety of the campus. Because the bicycle parking lot for the Theater and Dance West building is across the bike path, accessing the SRB is “challenging and dangerous during peak hours,” according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The letter also stated that current parking “poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space.”</p>\n<p>The Bike Committee first became involved with the North Landscaping Design Project in Spring Quarter 2017, and worked with the SRB Governance Board to add bike parking to their original design.</p>\n<p>“The [previous] design included space for approximately 35 bike parking spaces near the SRB main entrance. This space has been eliminated in the most recent proposal, and the Bike Committee hopes that it will be added back in,” A.S. Bike Committee Chair Annie Golay said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and SRB Governance Board Advisor Kim Equinoa said the changes sacrificed more bike parking for programming and study space.</p>\n<p>“The scope was narrowed to include one design area encompassing the grass area north of SRB and south of the bike path. In that transition, the space was designed to maximize programming and study space,” Equinoa said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>When the A.S. Bike Committee found out the newest design plan did not include new bike space, they wrote a letter directly to the SRB Governance Board detailing why new bike parking is necessary for the SRB.</p>\n<p>“Currently, students who wish to go to the Student Resource Building must park in the bike lot adjacent to the Theater and Dance West building. This poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space,” the letter states.</p>\n<p>In response to the resolution, Equinoa said “the SRB Governance Board is open to receiving any feedback and information that can help inform decisions.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

General Manager Troy Yamasaki, the new shop, located at 416 E Haley St., is revolutionary in its progressive steps toward reducing waste.</p>\n<p>“We are unique in that we don’t have any single-use to-go cups or single-use to-go anything,” Yamasaki said. “At Cajé in I.V. we understand that students are busy and have to run, but we do have a lot of consumer waste there.”</p>\n<p>“With us having the opportunity to open a shop with an entirely new concept, we thought that we should take a step in the right direction for the environment and cut down on our use of single-use plastic cups,” he added.</p>\n<p>The downtown Cajé relies on what is known as an “exchange program” as an alternative to single-use cups. Customers pay a deposit to use a reusable cup, which is repaid when the cup is returned.</p>\n<p>“We have an exchange program, so it is $5 for a hot cup and $2 for a Mason jar, and you pay that deposit and you get your order in a reusable cup,” Yamasaki said. “If you give it back to us, we give you [the deposit] back.”</p>\n<p>In contrast to the I.V. location, the downtown location will be a Prohibition-era themed bar beginning at 5 p.m. The bar, called Lab Social, is a speakeasy-style bar, meaning that it is hidden from public view.</p>\n<p>“[The bar] is supposed to be slightly incognito,” Yamasaki said. “It is a trend that a lot of bigger cities are doing, where instead of just being a bar with the front door open, it’s a bar that is kind of hidden within another store or hidden from plain sight.”</p>\n<p>The front door will be locked at nights, and customers will have to find their way into the bar through the back entrance, according to Yamasaki.</p>\n<p>Other differences between the I.V. location and the new Cajé downtown revolve around the menu.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista, we have bagels, acai bowls and smoothies,” Yamasaki said. “[Downtown], our menu right now is consisting of a tortilla española and an avocado toast, which is different than the location in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the downtown Cajé has formed a collaboration with Sama Sama Kitchen, an Asian fusion restaurant, to diversify Cajé’s menu. According to Yamasaki, the menu is expected to grow, with the full version to be rolled out come grand opening, pending a time and date to be determined.</p>\n<p>“The space is beautiful, and we are really excited to provide a downtown haven for our regulars in Cajé Isla Vista as well,” Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate all the love and support we have received so far. It’s actually been ridiculous how many regulars from our current location came out to show some love and some support. There is just a lot of gratitude here for that loyalty.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lean On Me is a national nonprofit organization that “automatically and anonymously matches peers to create texting networks of instantaneous support,” according to the organization’s <a href=\"https://lean0n.me/\">website</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rushali Kothari, a third-year biological sciences major, founded UCSB’s chapter this past fall quarter and now serves as the president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a 24/7, anonymous, peer-to-peer support text line. Anyone can text in at any time, and a trained student supporter will respond,” Kothari said. “It’s just a way to vent, or if you need to get something off your chest and you feel like you can’t go to anyone else, this is very easy and accessible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kothari heard about Lean On Me from a friend at another university and decided to bring the organization to UCSB. UCSB is the first UC to have a Lean On Me chapter, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The national organization handled the logistical end of setting up the hotline, Kothari said. Kothari and the rest of Lean On Me’s executive board act as the people “on the ground” who publicize the hotline and help train the student supporters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Lean On Me chapter spent the second half of Winter Quarter and the first half of Spring Quarter recruiting the 18 student supporters who are responsible for responding to the texts that are sent to the hotline. The application process involved both an online application and an interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student supporter went through a four-hour online training session provided by the national organization, along with a three-hour in-person workshop led by Lean On Me executive board members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The online training was a lot about empathy and vulnerability and just being open to listening to people,” Kothari said. “The workshop training was more hands-on. We went through a lot of different scenarios.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main two things are validating responses and validating how a person feels and how you do that, and then asking open-ended questions. Let the person… tell you what they want to tell you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The training also involved educating the student supporters about other resources in the local area so that they are able to refer people who text the hotline to those resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have systems in place if something does seem very serious… they’d alert the national team and get the person’s phone number if they’re in danger and then we can give that phone number to UCPD to get the person help if need be,” Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone texts the hotline, they have to agree to a list of terms and conditions before a student supporter can reach out to them. 30 people have texted the hotline since its launch on Monday, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people were just testing it out the first day. The text was like ‘hey, I’m just testing this out to see if it’s real,’ and we’d be like ‘yeah, it’s real, it’s working, you’ve got us!’” Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people have been using it for what it’s meant for, whether they’re stressed, they have mild mental health issues, eating disorders, family grief, whatever it might be, and we’re here to help.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Talbert, a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, is one of the 18 student supporters. She has exchanged texts with two people since the hotline’s launch on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main point is to make sure they know that there’s a lot of resources out there and that this is a good starting point if they need to go further, and if not, this is a good place to just… talk it out, basically,” Talbert said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some text conversations have lasted more than a day, while some are as short as 30 minutes, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To publicize the hotline, Lean On Me has been tabling in the Arbor and plans to put up flyers around campus and Isla Vista soon, Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lean On Me also wants to form partnerships with Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and UCSB Health &amp; Wellness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone has a lot of their own problems and their own things that they’re dealing with and sometimes it’s not easy to tell a friend or find someone to help you,” Kothari said. “C.A.P.S. is a great resource for sure but it can’t handle such a large school and the large amount of students that we have.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hotline’s number is (805) 874-5888.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said there were 12 student supporters.

id=\"caption-attachment-87928\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The change comes as part of a series of adjustments to the bus routes in Santa Barbara and Goleta to improve the timing and efficiency of routes. The line 28 adjustments were drafted by Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) and UC Santa Barbara and are scheduled to come into effect on Aug. 19.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding another bus to line 28 will allow buses to pass by every 10 minutes instead of the current 15-minute intervals, according to Hillary Blackerby, interim planning and marketing manager for SBMTD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Line 28 was established in August 2016 as part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UCSB’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>. The plan details campus development up to 2025 through changes in programs, transportation and housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB funds the operation of the shuttle. The quarterly lock-in student fee of $13.13 is based on enrollment in UCSB and allows students to ride the bus for free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby approached the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) at its April 23 meeting as part of SBMTD’s annual April outreach to inform the board of the proposed bus route changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby noted buses are often filled to capacity along El Colegio Road due to the high amount of students headed toward campus. Many of these students are what she describes as “line-neutral.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t care which [bus] you get on because you know whichever one you get on, it’s going to wind up at campus,” Blackerby said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When people are really just trying to get to campus, they’re filling up lines that have destinations past campus, like downtown.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buses headed toward campus are filled to capacity and exclude people farther down El Colegio as a consequence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 60-foot segmented buses with a standing load of 110 people were originally purchased for line 15x, but instead became used for line 28 due to higher demand. Even now, these buses are still reaching capacity and leaving people behind, according to Blackerby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She hopes the additional line 28 bus will relieve the overcrowding problems on other El Colegio buses, such as lines 7, 11 and 24x.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

A.S. is condemning these companies due to their involvement with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Both pieces of legislature, drafted by Off-Campus Senators Rafael Cornejo and Christian Ornelas, were student-sponsored by Rachel Andrews, Dylan Kupsh and A.S. President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>To attain “sanctuary status,” the school needs to meet several stipulations outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>Refusing to share information with immigration enforcement agencies, investing in “faculty and staff training to support undocumented students,” protecting students and faculty from deportation, barring I.C.E. from all UCSB-owned property and blocking “campus security” from asking about an “individual’s immigration status” all contribute to the definition of “sanctuary status,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The resolution calls for all current A.S. executive offices to “release a statement in support of the Undocumented community &amp; International Community at UCSB,” and for the A.S. Executive Director to “release a statement in support of UCSB as a ‘Sanctuary Campus.’”</p>\n<p>Ornelas also cited the Senate’s history of support for undocumented students by passing a resolution that supported voter rights for undocumented residents in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“This Senate and past Senates have history of supporting the undocumented community and it would be good to continue that. Earlier this year, we passed something about voter rights for undocumented folks in I.V. and it’s good to just do something on campus,” Ornelas said.</p>\n<p>Rachel Andrews, a second-year biopsychology major, spoke about the resolution during public forum. Andrews said undocumented students often fear being “separate from us, as if they’re not your neighbor or the person you’re sitting next to in class.”</p>\n<p>The bill carries similar sentiments to the resolution, with the exception that it is tailored specifically to UCSB-invested companies, stating that “Associated Students shall not provide assistance or resources” and will prohibit any presence of these companies in A.S. “physical space[s]” without the proper documentation to enter them.</p>\n<p>Also tacked onto the bill: “ASUCSB will no longer use e-verify in its practices in order to protect the identities of its undocumented members.” E-verify is a “web-based system that allows enrolled employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States,” according to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.e-verify.gov/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>While addressing the Senate, Kopel noted that she asked UC President Janet Napolitano if she plans to make UCSB a sanctuary campus. According to Kopel, Napolitano ultimately said she would not, citing fears that it would make UCSB a target if it were to assume the label of a “Sanctuary Campus.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

As an “alternative,” the $3.33 per quarter fee was proposed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/58384528_321304875200897_6072833742202732544_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1218723404\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87908\">“in order to continue providing night and weekend parking for students.”</a></p>\n<p>For the next five years, until around 2008, the permits were provided to students at no additional cost other than the $3.33 fee, according to Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) Director Nestor Covarrubias.</p>\n<p>But it’s 2019, and students are still paying that $3.33 per quarter fee – without the free night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>For the past 11 years, students have had to pay money on top of the $3.33 per quarter fee if they want night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>The $3.33 fee is currently being used to “partially cover” the full cost of a night and weekend parking permit, which stands at $160 for community members and $52.50 for students for three quarters, Covarrubias said in an email to the <i>Nexus.</i></p>\n<p>If that fee went away, students would pay the full $160, he confirmed.</p>\n<p>It was the discovery that the initial ballot language promised students “free” night and weekend parking that prompted A.S. President Brooke Kopel to post on her personal Facebook on April 22, encouraging UCSB students to vote no on the TPS $3.33 reaffirmation fee that was on the Spring Quarter 2019 ballot.</p>\n<p>“I have attempted to re-implement this free night and weekend parking that TPS has promised us. In conversations with A.S. staff, I have discovered that over the years since this lock-in was passed, TPS claims that the $3.33 fee is just no longer enough to supplement free night and weekend parking due to their own institutional growth and expansion,” Kopel said in the post.</p>\n<p>“BUT that is not what YOU pay for. YOU pay for FREE night and weekend parking. Not subsidized night and weekend parking.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>, Kopel explained that her predecessor, former A.S. President Hieu Le, attempted to “strong arm” TPS into providing students with free night and weekend parking toward the end of his term by asking A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez not to give TPS the money collected by student fees.</p>\n<p>Once Kopel took office, she said she was told by Márquez that A.S. cannot legally withhold that money from TPS.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s ballot language that was voted on and approved by the student body that this money will be paid to TPS, even though they’re not giving exactly what the ballot language says, Marisela can’t just withhold funds that students voted on giving to a department,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really, really irresponsible of Associated Students to be letting students pay $10 a year for a service they are not receiving. $10 could be a few meals, $10 could go to rent, $10 could go to gas, to books.”</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, the fee was reaffirmed with 3901 yeses, or 71.79%, and 1533 noes, or 28.21%. It cannot be voted on again until Spring Quarter 2021.</p>\n<p>If A.S. was “open to the idea,” Covarrubias said, “TPS could come up with an updated rate to provide the undergraduate Night &amp; Weekend permit at no additional cost.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [1:15 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

her time, according to a statement released by UC President Janet Napolitano on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“We were extremely honored and fortunate to have Ellen serve on the UC Board of Regents where her expertise and passion for quality education… helped us navigate complex issues facing the university,” Napolitano said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Before sitting on the board, she held a seat in Congress, worked on Wall Street for 14 years and was one of the first female members of the New York Stock Exchange, according to the UC Regents website.</p>\n<p>While in Congress, Tauscher served in several subcommittees, including within the Strategic Forces Subcommittee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee.</p>\n<p>Tauscher also received her bachelor’s degree in early childhood development from Seton Hall University.</p>\n<p>Governor Gavin Newsom also released a statement on Tauscher’s passing, stating Tauscher “blazed trails in business and in the halls of Congress” and “held her own at some of the world’s toughest negotiating tables.”</p>\n<p>In their statements, both Gavin and Napolitano spoke about Tauscher’s “grace” during pressing times.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein described Tauscher as “brilliant, gracious and generous” in a statement she released after Tauscher’s death.</p>\n<p>“She had a knack for getting to the bottom of an issue smartly but also in ways that people could really understand. She truly loved her country and it was an honor to work with her,” Feinstein said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Tauscher joined the Board of Regents in June 2017 after being appointed by former California Governor Jerry Brown. She was one of 17 other appointed regents who sat on the board, in addition to Napolitano.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Barbara’s Pan Asian Network and Indus, an on-campus group for South Asian culture and awareness, joined hands to put on a vigil attended by about 80 people. Throughout the vigil, organizers and speakers brought to light both the stories of the people who died as well as the strength, resilience and compassion of the Sri Lankan community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight speakers took the stage that night, which included a handful of UCSB students as well as a high school student from the Santa Barbara area. Several faculty members and administrators also took time to share their sentiments, including Zaveeni Khan-Marcus, director of the MultiCultural Center, Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vigil organizers passed out small, battery-operated blue light candles, which attendees switched on as they were placed in their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Dhishal Jayasinghe was one of the first to take the stage, during which he spoke about his childhood and various identities as a “Singhalese, Buddhist, Sri Lankan, American, asylum seeker who came here at the age of three years old fleeing war.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jayasinghe described his gratefulness for the people who showed up to support the bombing victims and urged the audience members to reject the destructive ideals of nationalism and instead opt for unity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Shobha Ambi, who spoke after Jayasinghe, shared her “frustration and sadness” with the crowd, tearing up as she expressed her disbelief at the scale of the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Any life lost is heartbreaking enough, but 253 lives is overwhelming on an entirely different level,” Ambi said. “My heart hurts for the victims whose lives were taken away so unjustly and for their families who are forced to deal with the consequences.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ambi recounted the stories of some of those who lost their lives on April 21, including that of an 11-year-old child. Ambi said she was disappointed by the lack of focus she saw on the victims of the attack, with more attention seeming to go toward the attackers and the Sri Lankan government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Does no one comprehend the death of how many lives were ripped away just four days ago? 253 lives,” Ambi said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She echoed sentiments similar to that of Jayasinghe, stating that one doesn’t need to be Sri Lankan to understand the tragedy suffered by the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These weren’t just the lives of Sri Lankans that were taken away. These were the lives of human beings,” Ambi said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87792\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/a-vigil-goer-holding-the-led-candle-distributed-by-the-organizer/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-87792\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87792\" data-attachment-id=\"87792\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/a-vigil-goer-holding-the-led-candle-distributed-by-the-organizer/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1313&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1313\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"A vigil goer holding the LED candle distributed by the organizer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=888%2C583&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87792\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=888%2C583\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87792\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vigil organizers passed out blue light candles. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB student, Huda Faiz, took the stage next, expressing her love for Sri Lanka at  the beginning of her speech. Faiz said that now, many people know her home only for the tragedies that have taken place there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to Faiz, it’s something much different. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sri Lanka to you is 253 lives that were lost and counting,” she said. “But Sri Lanka to me is the birds singing at the break of dawn. It’s the old man selling vegetables rolling his cart down my street calling for buyers at 6 a.m. It’s the fresh smell of morning tea and home-cooked coconut rice wafting from my aunt’s kitchen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said the community of Sri Lanka is one that is built upon principles of love, tolerance, acceptance and resilience. For Faiz, the power of the community to unite against the forces of intolerance is something that should be seen before the tragedies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz stressed the power that can be harnessed with love and community. She finished her portion with a Christian prayer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the vigil, Jayasinghe returned to the microphone to share his thanks to the organizers of the event and the attendees. Attendees then returned their candles to a table in the center, where the small blue lights shone in the shape of the number 253.</span></p>\n<p>Further photos from the vigil can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
