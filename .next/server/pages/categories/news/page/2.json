Tuition and fees for fall will also remain unchanged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang also said that any student who wishes to continue learning entirely remotely will be given the option to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the email stated that the school would be updating procedures as new safety protocols are released and is “thinking creatively” about face-to-face interaction, currently “all courses with an enrollment of more than 50 students will require remote instruction,” Yang stated in the email.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, classes with less than 50 students have no guarantee of in-person instruction, which will be limited to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small classes, seminars and some arts and performance courses and labs. Decisions about final course formats will be announced in July, Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that the plans for fall quarter instruction are not final, and that the university is working to “develop more face-to-face course offerings.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is also currently planning for all undergraduate residence halls to be limited to double occupancy — with the possibility of limiting rooms to single occupants — reducing the number of housing spaces available to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All students who will be living in campus residences during the 2020-21 school year will be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test and the school will be implementing additional safety policies, including limiting social interactions for the first two weeks, enforcing a no-visitor policy and asking students not to travel away from campus during the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student housing will not be impacted by the new social distancing practices and most graduate seminars will be conducted remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the hybrid class arrangement, tuition and student fees will not be reduced “r</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">egardless of the method of instruction,” following policies set by the University of California Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President, Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university plans to provide both remote and in-person campus life activities as well as co-curricular programming. These activities will be contingent on new safety practices,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including requiring masks to be worn at all times, performing daily health checks before entering campus, and following social distancing guidelines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email also detailed plans to “bring student-athletes back to campus in preparation for fall competition and the academic year … in alignment with the NCAA’s resocialization action plan for college sports.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang informed students of coronavirus-related research being piloted by UCSB faculty, including “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research surveillance testing study</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> using a CRISPR-based detection system that is designed to detect COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals,” currently in the development stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The campus is also putting in place a structure that will enable the testing of campus community members who show symptoms of COVID-19 with traditional qPCR testing,” the email continued, also stating that UCSB will be “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working closely with local public health officials, and will be supporting Public Health’s efforts to conduct contact tracing of campus community members who test positive for COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is also planning to ramp up in-person research projects and “ultimately to get all on-campus research projects underway again at effective levels, while still reducing the number of people working on campus during the pandemic,” Yang wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff not involved in approved on-campus research and currently working from home will continue to work remotely from home during the summer. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

from, the collective possibilities of national life,” </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200ACA5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ACA 5 states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amendment also states that since Proposition 209 passed in 1996, “diversity within public educational institutions has been stymied.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Proposition 209 instigated a dramatic change in admissions policy at the University of California, with underrepresented group enrollment at the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses of the University of California immediately falling by more than 60 percent and systemwide underrepresented group enrollment falling by at least 12 percent. Underrepresented group high school graduates faced substantial long-term declines in educational and employment outcomes as a result of these changes,” the amendment read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/june20/b1.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">memo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by Napolitano’s office on Monday, the “UC has not kept pace with the diversity of students in California K-12 schools or with the overall California population.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The percentage of underrepresented groups graduating high school in California had nearly doubled to upwards of 56% in 2016, the memo states, while the percentage of underrepresented groups in the UC freshman class peaked at 37% in the same year – “an increase that can be attributed to the increase in enrollment across all UC undergraduate campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It makes little sense to exclude any consideration of race in admissions when the aim of the University’s holistic process is to fully understand and evaluate each applicant through multiple dimensions,” UC President Janet Napolitano said in a press release sent out Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Proposition 209 has forced California public institutions to try to address racial inequality without factoring in race, even where allowed by federal law,” Napolitano wrote in the press release. “The diversity of our university and higher education institutions across California, should — and must — represent the rich diversity of our state.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Attorney General Tyler Barth explained in an email to the Senate that due to recent circumstances, it was possible to temporarily waive the requirements.  </span><em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to waive the requirement for the upcoming school year was made in light of uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, according to the resolution’s first author, On-Campus Senator Gurleen Pabla, who spoke during the Wednesday night Associated Students (A.S.) Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are five on-campus senators for the 2020-21 school year: Senator Pabla, Senator Adam Bagul, Senator Anusikha Halder, Senator Dania De Ramon and Senator Taylor Tait, who seconded the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of us are aware how we don’t know how we’re going to move forward with housing and school in general,” Pabla said. “A lot of people are going to have a lot of restrictions moving forward, whether it be housing in general or financial problems.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It might not even apply to some of us senators — but there are others that have constrictions that we should be aware of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tait added during the meeting that this is a “unique situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Housing is very up in the air. There’s no confirmed statement [from the university.] It’s unfair to expect all of our senators to have on-campus housing when it’s not really up to them how they can live, especially when you factor in social distancing, spreading our dorms and all the [approaches]that housing is going to take for our safety and health,” Tait said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the May University of California Board of Regents meeting, UC President Janet Napolitano </span><a href=\"https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2020/05/uc-regents-fall-2020-budget-coronavirus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the UC system would make a decision regarding the state of Fall Quarter 2020 in mid-June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, Interim Student Health Service Medical Director Ali Javanbakht </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/hybrid-course-schedules-single-dorms-face-masks-for-all-preparing-for-fall-quarter-2020-at-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">told the Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that UCSB is considering offering only singles and doubles in residence halls next year. However, he also said there’s concern among Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s COVID-19 Response Working Group that this could mean a shortage of beds and push more people into I.V. during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The on-campus housing requirement — a part of A.S. Legal Code — has long been a subject of debate on the Senate table. Typically, the Senate does not have the power to waive the requirement, as the requirements for senators are in the A.S. Constitution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Tyler Barth explained in an email to the Senate that due to recent circumstances, it was possible to temporarily waive the requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The California state government supersedes A.S. Legal Code. Seeing as how this is an unforeseen circumstance, and given that the state is under executive order from the Governor, it is up to the Senate to accommodate and be responsive, as necessary,” Barth said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Senators technically do not have the power to waive those requirements within the confines of our student government, but the state layer of governance is supreme, in this case. The Senate is doing the best they can to adapt to our current situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate will resume its regular meetings during Fall Quarter 2020.

id=\"caption-attachment-94880\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar, titled “The Fire This Time: Race at Boiling Point,” featured a panel of five prominent speakers. </span>Courtesy<em> of UCHRI</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar, titled “The Fire This Time: Race at Boiling Point,” featured prominent speakers such as Angela Davis, a professor emerita at UC Santa Cruz and a renowned political activist; Herman Gray, a professor emeritus at UC Santa Cruz; Gaye Theresa Johnson, a professor of African American studies at UC Los Angeles; Robin D. G. Kelley, a professor of African American studies and American history at UC Los Angeles; and Josh Kun, a professor of communication and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar began with a discussion about the meaning of the phrase “I can’t breathe,” a phrase associated with the Black Lives Matter movement and some of the last words from </span><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/i-cant-breathe-george-floyds-words-reverberate-oppression\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">George Floyd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/10/23/559498678/i-can-t-breathe-explores-life-and-death-at-the-hands-of-police\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eric Garner</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two Black men who were both killed by white police officers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gray highlighted the phrase’s dual meaning, both as a symbol of environmental racism experienced by Black people and the product of illegal choke holds used by law enforcement to detain Black people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think about breath in terms of environment and polluted air and the environmental degradation that Black and brown people have to live through,” Gray said. “Breathe and breathing as the terms to understand the devastating health impact of the pandemic of COVID-19, which disproportionately attacks Black and brown people, particularly around respiratory systems in urban populations and older populations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Breath also expresses the constricted air available to Black men, women and children at the hands of police, through illegal tactics like choke holds and knees to the neck,” he continued. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Breath is constricted because of the stresses and strains that parents, grandparents, partners, whose daily life is often relegated to overcrowded and under resourced conditions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson discussed the role of the protests in inciting change and how the ongoing struggle for equality is representative of “a different kind of calculus of human work.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of the things that are happening right now, while they are incredibly concerning, they are also, as we all know, incredibly hopeful and powerful,” Johnson continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation shifted from domestic movements to international ones, Davis discussed the global response to police brutality and racial inequality. She highlighted her experiences with academics and activists from the Brazilian state of Amazonas, which she said suffers from not only discrimination and violence from the police, but also an extreme militarization of its police. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The nation state [in America], as we know it, is no longer possible, and so a broad international perspective not only helps us to imagine solidarity but to think about what kind of future we want,” Davis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we say ‘abolish prisons,’ when we say ‘abolish the police,’ we are thinking about a future in which we will have moved beyond the bourgeois capitalist notion of the nation state,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Davis, Kelley revisited the development of the nation state and its efforts to facilitate racial inequality as a “repressive arm” that asserts control through “police power [and] military power,” he said, especially during times of unrest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In responding to Davis’ comments about dismantling the nation state, Kelley said Davis is “laying out a vision of internationalism, which is in some ways the beginnings of a global vision that focuses on the conditions of the least of us, that creates the conditions of life for working people around the globe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things about this moment we’re in now is that it is deeply international, it’s deeply multiracial, it is broad, and … it builds on a decade of struggles that Black Lives Matter, in particular, has laid out,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Kelley, Johnson spoke about how the rise of authoritarianism and policing in America speaks to the fragility of white supremacy, and how those who support the nation state are reinforcing the “master narrative,” which Johnson described as the belief that the inequalities Americans face are unique to this country. That, however, is untrue, Johnson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even when you hear people who are liberals talk about, ‘Oh I can’t believe this is happening in our country and everybody is hurting, I can’t believe we’re in these times.’ These times have always been here,” Johnson said. “The only thing that has changed, is again, we’ve had enough.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis added that unlike past movements, especially those that predate the digital era of citizen journalism — the phenomenon in which ordinary bystanders or witnesses to an event can record and share those events through social media — the public reaction to the death of George Floyd has been met with </span><a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/george-floyd-protests-world-racism/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intense and widespread emotion.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was something about the witnessing of George Floyd’s last breaths that has become a collective phenomenon. We’ve all been transformed because we’ve all seen the last nine minutes of this brother’s life,” Davis said. “That emotional connection has been very much lacking in our movements prior to the more recent era.”    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis also said that the feminist intersection of organizing movements for Black lives often goes unrecognized, although the </span><a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/our-co-founders/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Lives Matter movement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, along with many others, was founded and run by Black women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelley applauded the efforts of Black women in organizing demonstrations — citing one that took place just outside his house on Beverly Boulevard. “All they have is a face mask,” he said, highlighting the fact that many Black female activists are risking their lives to organize demonstrations in the wake of the coronavirus, which </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-coronavirus-racial-disparities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disproportionately affects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Black people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to leading movements, Kelley said some people still subscribe to the ideology that “what the movement needs is the male leader.” Although people still hold onto that idea, he said, “I think it’s dying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation drew to a close, Kun spoke to the momentum of the ongoing worldwide movements for Black lives and the unprecedented intensity by which society is demanding change. He warned, however, that this intensity will die down, but that it’s imperative to avoid compressing “longitudinal” movements — those that span months or years — into a week of protests, which can damage their longevity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis is impressed with the progress already made by movements for Black lives, and “the extent to which notions of systemic racism, structural racism, institutional racism [have] thoroughly permeated the mainstream.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an extremely important moment because [the] work that we’ve been doing for such a long time … seems to be reaching a kind of fruition,” she said. “But I’m especially interested in Black Lives Matter — the negative responses that first occurred when the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ emerged in the context of the Ferguson protests.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So many people were saying, ‘Shouldn’t all lives matter?’ But I think now people are beginning to get it,” she said. “And I’ve seen a lot of signs that say ‘All lives will not matter until Black lives matter.’”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

So a little less traditional archiving for community archives,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Force is working with Matt Stahl, the university archivist, on the COVID-19 archives project. Stahl said archives focus traditionally on documents like administrative records; while Stahl and Force plan to collect UCSB announcements and official documents related to the coronavirus pandemic, the focus for this project is to provide a community perspective of life during the coronavirus pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The all-digital aspect of the project adds a greater degree of access for the UCSB community, many of whom are scattered across the country, to safely participate in the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through a google form on the </span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/ucsb-covid-19-community-archives-project-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University Library</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> website, interested participants can answer questions about their coronavirus stories –– where they are waiting out the pandemic, how they have been impacted and how the pandemic has changed their perspective on life — all while remaining anonymous.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions could be anything from YouTube videos about a day in the life during the coronavirus pandemic to photographs of an empty UCSB campus to personal blogs, but the possibilities for submissions are limitless, Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows for a safe place for self-expression and catharsis,” Force said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for Force, the role of documenting UCSB history during the coronavirus pandemic goes beyond simply archiving — preserving the experiences of individuals during the pandemic is an essential piece to recovering and surviving it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re kind of acting as cultural heritage first responders. We’re responding to moments of tragedy and crisis in a different way than the frontline medical professionals do,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re offering a way to preserve people’s stories and truths, not only for evidentiary value but for self edification to capture historical moments at its most raw and unfiltered form.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl pointed to other examples of when UCSB archive projects were used as a response to community crises, like the</span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/special-collections/isla-vista-memorial-project\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Isla Vista Memorial Project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The COVID-19 archives project parallels the memorial project because both projects ask fundamental questions of “how are people dealing with trauma,” and “how does the UCSB community deal with trauma,” Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 archives project has been accepting submissions through its website since May 14, but there is no set deadline for the closure of submissions. Force said that the move to a digital platform will make keeping up with submissions more difficult, as technology advances quickly and the project team will have to stay up to date with making the archives “safe and accessible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions are limited to UCSB-affiliated participants and will be curated through a “quality control process,” Stahl said, but noted that this process is only to filter out non-serious submissions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that Force and Stahl are in the collecting phase of the project, the next step will be organizing the incoming submissions and data from participants, known as “post-capture work.” Here, Stahl and Force will work to preserve the files and find a place to store them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond preserving the everyday stories of the coronavirus pandemic, Force hopes that this project will open the community to the University Library’s archive work and encourage future collaborations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are places that want to tell their stories, that want to collect their history, that your individual experience matters,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Telling that story as accurately as possible and creating that safe space and kind of forging those bonds is critical to the human experience.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The new resolution will require the Internal Vice President to read a land recognition before every senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Esme Quintero-Cubillan, who was the first author on both resolutions, said her conversations with Mia Lopez, UCSB’s American Indian Student Association (AISA) tribal liaison, inspired her to write a resolution that was a “call to action” as well as a recognition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the public forum, students expressed the importance of representation for Indigenous students, who make up only 1% of the school’s population. Jeike Meijer, UCSB’s 2018-2019 External Vice President for Local Affairs and an Indigenous student, called on senators to do more for Indigenous communities in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A couple of minutes at the beginning of a senate meeting is so small, if you think about it, and as student leaders your platforms said that you aim to represent minorities and more minority groups. And this seems literally like the most tiny way that you can do that,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate passed a second resolution on Friday condemning the United States’ “inadequate response” to the conditions of the Navajo Nation amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Navajo Nation is currently experiencing an </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-06-03/la-na-navajo-nation-coronavirus-police\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infection rate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is higher than New York City. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quintero-Cubillan said the resolution also focuses on how the government “left [behind] the Navajo Nation” and “how they failed to provide for them” amidst a pandemic. The resolution details how the Navajo Nation has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and ensures the A.S. Senate will “continue to support the Navajo Nation through advocacy, awareness, and however stipulated by indigenous advocates.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were promised $8 million in aid, yet were only supplied body bags. And I really tried to hit home the idea that America genuinely does not care about Indigenous lives or Indigenous voices,” Quintero-Cubillan continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Quintero-Cubillan and Meijer emphasized the importance of holding the University of California (UC) accountable for harming indigenous communities, including the UC’s role in </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-05/thirty-meter-telescope-has-received-68m-from-uc-in-past-six-years/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funding the Thirty Meter Telescope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Hawaii which is planned to be built on sacred mountain of Mauna Kea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“America is occupied land. People were forcibly removed, there was genocide. We’re still living with those impacts today. We’re still living with the trauma. It’s in everything that we do,” Meijer said during the public forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quintero-Cubillan said she is currently speaking with indigenous advocates on how to better support the Navajo Nation and plans on “introducing a bill that would immortalize the land acknowledgement,” as the resolution will grandfather out after the 71st Senate’s term ends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is so important because it cannot die with me,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like when we change the legal code, that’s when suddenly, regardless of whether or not I’m here, people will always have something to point to and be like, you need to do this right now.”</span></p>\n<p><i style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Correction [6/06/2020 12:20]: This article has been corrected to reflect Mia Lopez’s position as the AISA’s tribal </i><i>liaison</i><i style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Indigenous has been capitalized. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Kea Protectors at UC Berkeley in early May and details the UC’s history of contributions to TMT from October 2014 to February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But until recently, public knowledge surrounding the UC’s use of its own funds for the roughly </span><a href=\"https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2020/03/17/hawaii-news/thirty-meter-telescope-cost-estimate-increases-to-2-4b/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.4 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> telescope project has been largely speculative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an </span><a href=\"http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/mar14/f4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">action item</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the March 2014 Board of Regents meeting, the UC and Caltech agreed to split a $250 million pledge from GBMF and to jointly raise an additional $100 million from their own funds. The UC said in the action item that it planned to raise its half of the share — $50 million — through “philanthropic support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But funding directly from the UC has come from a variety of other sources, including reallocated funding from another observatory project, the UC’s department of Research and Graduate Studies and “systemwide funds,” which are used “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for an array of purposes including teaching and research,” Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the UC, said in an email to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student fees, however, are not included in the UC’s contributions to TMT, according to UC Spokesperson Claire Doan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC had contributed to TMT solely through grants from GBMF from October 2014 until October 2016, when it made a $10 million contribution to TMT using its own funds, according to the financial report. The $10 million contribution was one of the largest donations listed on the financial report, second to a $13,883,525 contribution made that same month from GBMF grant funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, the UC has continued to make contributions with its own funds in varying amounts — some as small as $126 in September 2017 and others as large as $5 million, which it paid out four separate times in June 2018, November 2018, August 2019 and February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The timing of the UC’s February 2020 contribution to TMT also came less than a month after UC Board of Regents Chair John Pérez said at the Board’s January meeting that he intended to facilitate a discussion about the UC’s involvement with the project, The Daily Californian </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/05/22/uc-invests-68m-into-thirty-meter-telescope-on-maunakea/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the activist organization Uprooted &amp; Rising said at a </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/uprootedandrising/videos/920585268346863/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press conference</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 21 that the UC has not engaged in any discussions surrounding its involvement in the project. Many students spoke at a public forum during the May 21 Board of Regents virtual Zoom meeting, asking the Regents to divest from TMT and echoing the demands of an </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the UC Student Association in September 2019 calling on the UC to cut financial ties with the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite ongoing friction from UC students who contest TMT’s development on Native Hawaiian land, the UC maintains that it is “deeply committed” to respecting the environment and culture surrounding Mauna Kea and has collaborated with the Hawaiian community “to address a range of cultural, environmental, educational and economic issues,” Holbrook wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jeike Meijer, a fourth-year global studies and feminist studies double major and an organizer for the Mauna Kea Protectors at UC Santa Barbara, “this investment is making a very big statement about [the UC’s] lack of support for Indigenous and Hawaiian students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said many students are frustrated with the UC because they feel that their opposition to TMT has gone ignored and that the UC’s opacity with the project is a disservice to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the UC Board of Regents virtual meeting from May 19-21, Meijer said she and Terrill James Kaneali‘i Williams, an Indigeneous Hawaiian graduate student from UC Riverside, were promised an opportunity to speak during public forum; after speaking first, Meijer said the Board of Regents did not call on Kaneali‘i Williams to speak, even though “they promised two days in a row to call [on] him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so frustrating because there’s no other way for him to get to talk to the board because it’s all virtual now. And it felt like they were silencing him,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That was really frustrating for me because I’m Indigenous, but I’m not Hawaiian. And we were banking on having the Hawaiian voice be there,” she added. “So it’s really challenging with these virtual Board of Regents meetings because they can choose to just not call [on] people and that seems to be what they’ve done.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, students have voiced their concerns regarding TMT in a variety of ways, including a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December with Native Hawaiian activists, </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/students-condemn-uc-and-chancellor-yangs-involvement-in-thirty-meter-telescope-express-support-for-native-hawaiians/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to condemn the university’s involvement and meetings with Chancellor Henry T. Yang, who currently chairs TMT’s board of governors. Despite his title, Yang maintains that his role in TMT </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is miniscule. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to these concerns, Mejier is also worried about the environmental aspects of TMT. Mauna Kea is considered sacred in Native Hawaiian culture and is home to multiple endangered </span><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/ENDANGERED/bulletin/2002/03-06/22-23.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wildlife species</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that cannot be found anywhere else on earth, she said. Should TMT continue building the telescope, it may put Mauna Kea’s unique ecosystems at risk, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kealoha Pisciotta, </span><a href=\"http://kahea.org/blog/mk-vignette-kealoha-pisciotta\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">founder</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the protest group Mauna Kea Anaina Hou, said during the Uprooted &amp; Rising press conference in May that Native Hawaiians have been pleading to Gordon and Betty Moore for years to stand with them to protect Mauna Kea. Over a decade since TMT broke ground, she said, their calls have still been unanswered and the Native Hawaiian elders — known as kupunas — are still on the frontlines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only way to do this project is they’re going to have to hurt people,” Pisciotta said, “because the kupunas are willing to die.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Her Senate resolution, which is positional and only takes a stance on the issue, urges the university to “bear the increased financial consequences of a situation that is essentially out of their control.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution, this could come in the shape of university-subsidized housing, where students are exempted from paying any potential inflations in room and board prices if their housing rates increase as a result of room availability changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe UCSB’s Housing department should not inflate room and board prices in an effort to make up for any lost revenue from students who decide not to, or are unable to, live on-campus during a possible [sic] hybrid/online course period,” the resolution continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gurleen Pabla, a first-year political science major and on-campus senator who seconded the resolution, said she is concerned that students of color, low-income students and first-generation students will be “disproportionately disadvantaged” if the only options for on-campus housing are singles or doubles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of students that otherwise wouldn’t have to take out as many loans or spend as much time also doing a job just to maintain a single or a double when they could have comfortably, or at least not been so concerned, with living in a triple or quad,” Pabla said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unfair to students that just want to have a fun college life and that are now having to deal with this concern of a price [for a single or double room],” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/rates\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s housing website,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the 2019-20 rate of a triple room with fourteen meals a week is $15,767 per year. The rate of a double room with 14 meals a week is $17,767, $2,000 more than the triple, and the rate of a single room with 14 meals a week is $19,267, $3,500 more per year than the triple room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the precarity of fall quarter in mind, De Ramon said “it’s really important that the university, and every department within the university, always puts students and the needs of students before any sort of profit or revenue.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Many people at the demonstration condemned Yang for his empty words and his failure to show up that day. Others referenced the lawsuits filed against the UC Police Department (UCPD) on the Santa Barbara campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In May 2019, the Nexus reported that there were three active lawsuits against current and former members of the UCPD. Since then, more current and former officers have filed their own lawsuits. There are currently </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-26/sixth-ucpd-lawsuit-filed-against-department-alleging-sexual-harassment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six active lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These lawsuits allege serious misconduct by police officers within the department, including widespread racism and sexism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To date, the university has failed to publicly address these lawsuits, or student concerns that stemmed from learning about them. Students, staff and faculty did not hear a single public assurance that these lawsuits or the misconduct alleged in them would be independently investigated, or that the department would be making any internal changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we did get were stories from The Current, the public relations arm of the university, </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019466/leading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introducing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the new police chief, James Brock, and the </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apparent changes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> he was making to the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Nexus tried to interview Brock after he was first hired in April 2019 and after The Current published a </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">story</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about his “open-door policy” and “the importance of creating relationships with students and building trust between the student body and the department,” we were stonewalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any emails we sent to Brock were either ignored or directed to the public affairs department, who told us that Brock was too busy to speak with us directly and that we should email our questions to them, despite us emailing numerous times over the course of a month and offering flexibility in interview times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits are also not being dealt with publicly. Despite continuously reaching out to the lawyers, the Nexus has not been able to learn much about the progress of any internal mediations. As of April 2020, the university has been conducting an internal investigation into the allegations, according to a lawyer representing several plaintiffs in the lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To this day, the student body knows very little about what is happening within the UCSB Police Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last December, Yang announced the </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2019-12-02-police-advisory-board\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Police Advisory Board. A memo about the board’s creation was posted to the Office of the Chancellor website, but there was no campus-wide email sent to the student body. Despite its goal of “enhanc[ing] communication between the police department and the campus community,” not a single email has been sent to students about the board’s progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police officers across the nation are protected by a lack of transparency and accountability within the criminal justice system that the UC and UCSB are perpetuating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Yang wants to condemn and address the effects of police misconduct, he needs to start on this campus. Start by being transparent with the student body about what changes were made after the lawsuits were filed and about the disciplinary records of all the officers within the department. Students on this campus deserve to know who is policing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond UCSB, the UC system as a whole needs to do more. UC President Janet Napolitano and Board of Regents Chair John A. Pérez sent out a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-statement-protests-violence-following-george-floyd-s-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Sunday condemning the recent racist killings of Black people and committing to “re-examine our own practices and ensure we continue to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing that we established two years ago.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former UC student journalist, Gabe Schneider, recently published an article titled “</span><a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/uc-campuses-have-disclosed-virtually-no-records-under-police-transparency-law/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Campuses Have Disclosed Virtually No Records Under Police Transparency Law,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” that drew attention to how little transparency there is within UC police departments across the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schneider noted that the UC system “is aware of more than 200 incidents involving police use of force on its 10 campuses in recent years. Nearly half of those incidents resulted in the injury of an officer or another person.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yet only two police use of force case files have been released publicly,” Schneider wrote.                                         </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s despite California Senate Bill 1421, a landmark transparency law that went into effect last year. It requires police to turn over internal records involving police shootings and use of force, and instances of sexual assault or lying by on-duty officers,” Schneider continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC needs to release these records, and it needs to be more transparent with students about the misconduct within its police departments. It is not enough to write platitudes in a statement, and it is certainly not enough to say that the UC will “continue to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing” without explaining what those steps will look like, and how students will directly be impacted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system and UCSB cannot claim to condemn these acts of police violence across the nation while simultaneously shielding records of misconduct within its own police departments. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We

for many graduate students’ choice to extend their degree is whether or not they will receive additional funding. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But some graduate students are saying that it is unclear how many students — faced with the cost associated with an extra year of study — will utilize this offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just hard to get a sense of where people are at and it’s also hard to get a sense of how your research is impacted,” Alexander LeBrun, Vice President of Academic Affairs for the Graduate Student Association (GSA) and representative to the Graduate Council, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Graduate Council is allowing three additional quarters for time-to-degree and time-to-candidacy, no additional funding is guaranteed, according to the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18opTv7ABHar4PsMKTCg2AI0tkMKMlIeZ9Amxp8yPPuw/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAQ sheet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the extension was offered to every graduate student, the Graduate Division expects “many, if not most, students will be able to meet their milestones and complete their degrees following the normal timelines,” according to the FAQ sheet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, LeBrun says it’s “hard to quantify” how many students could take advantage of this extension but hopes it will benefit those experiencing </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-05/as-in-person-research-goes-dormant-ucsb-researchers-explore-new-methods-of-work/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a halt to their research</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and other facets of their graduate study because of the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mostly, I’m thinking of people who work in labs,” he said. “There’s only a handful of labs that are currently open, and those are the essential, and also COVID-related, labs. And soon we’re going to be opening a couple more [labs], but that doesn’t account for enough graduate students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year-long extension will also not apply to graduate student housing, which LeBrun says is already “not prioritized” by the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If there’s too many grad students and not enough housing, it seems like we’ll just have to find stuff in the community,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a third-year Philosophy Ph.D student, LeBrun doesn’t do field research or work in a lab, but said that the humanities and social sciences are still impacted by the pandemic and that those graduate students may need more time to complete their degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even me, who just sits at home and does my research, I’m being impacted,” he said. “My mental health is impacting my ability to do my research. It’s so hard to concentrate on arcane, philosophical questions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest determining factors for many graduate students’ choice to extend their degree is whether or not they will receive additional funding –– which LeBrun says remains uncertain for many due to budget limitations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the “time extensions will allow students to maintain funding eligibility,” according to the Graduate Division FAQ sheet, the time extension “[does] not guarantee an availability of additional funding.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding for graduate students, determined either by their department as teaching assistants or research assistants, covers their tuition and health insurance, and provides a salary, LeBrun says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no guarantee to get funding for that next year. It’s up to either your department if you’re a TA, or your advisor if you’re in research whether they have the resources to pay you.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LeBrun worries that some graduate students who have no choice but to extend their degree will be forced to take out loans if they don’t receive additional funding from departments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s only a limited number of TAships for each department and if you have to give one to a student who has extended their time-to-degree, then that means another student doesn’t get that TAship,” LeBrun said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securing funding and housing, in addition to completing their degrees, are stressors to graduate students, who also take on the role of instructors as TAs –– a role that has only grown more difficult since the start of remote learning, LeBrun said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the vote to extend degree timelines, LeBrun says GSA has just been doing “damage control” to help graduate students. Recently, GSA diverted all graduate student fees –– normally used for events during spring quarter –– to a </span><a href=\"https://gsa.ucsb.edu/covid19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 relief grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, providing over $30,000 of relief to students who are particularly impacted, according to LeBrun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping that a system will be worked out where there’s a pot of money for those [graduate students choosing to extend] to continue to get funding, or at least reduced tuition or something like that.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/","id":1,"author":{"id":234,"name":"Madeline Thompson"},"related":[0,-1,-2],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Achievement Unlocked: UCSB’s Gaming Community Adapts to Remote Instruction","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2ifcvSNr.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2ifcvSNr.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"While clubs have faced difficulties staying together as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Gaucho Gaming is uniquely positioned to make the leap from in-person to digital social events.

The group, created in the fall of 2015, offers a variety of different gaming platforms for UCSB students from the amateur to competitive level. Gaucho Gaming has 942 members on its Discord server, which the group uses to promote and organize events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At school, we also have in-person events, so that definitely brings people together and we just all have a common interest,” Annie Huang, a second-year statistics and linguistics double major and the co-president of Gaucho Gaming, said. “So now, we have only online communication and activities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While clubs have faced difficulties staying together as a result of having their members strewn across the country and isolated at home, Gaucho Gaming is uniquely positioned to make the leap from in-person social events to online-only communication. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since gaming is, obviously, an online thing, it’s been a way to keep in touch with friends, and keeps me connected ” Huang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a joke, that we’re helping save the world by staying inside and gaming,” Huang added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, the club hosts “re</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gular meetings, fun socials, competitive events, and a huge LAN event every quarter,” a local area network that interconnects computers within physical spaces like room or arena, according to its website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Discord server allows members to make friends and find gaming buddies, as well as “more serious stuff” like opportunities for jobs within the gaming field, Huang said, which has also continued during spring quarter. This Saturday, Gaucho Gaming and UCSB Esports will host a panel in the Discord called “Career in Esports,” with industry professionals from Team Liquid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the club has worked to expand its professional network with the help of Francisco Rodriguez, a fourth-year global studies and economics major and the club’s esports outreach officer, who organizes panels and helps gamers understand career paths within the gaming industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the group had a “rocky start” with participation at the start of the online quarter, according to Huang, the cancellation of in-person socializing events forced them to get creative. And with computer-savvy students at the helm, Huang said she has been pleased with recent event participation, despite the challenges they’ve faced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 16, Gaucho Gaming hosted its first-ever Game-A-Thon, sponsored by the gaming gear company Logitech G, where players participated in popular video games League of Legends and Valorant for prizes including Logitech G computer mice, gift cards and game credits, according to their Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Game-A-Thon, which was meant to serve as a replacement for the group’s popular LAN event, saw about 200 participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho Gaming has also hosted other events this quarter, like weekly game play, giveaways, and watch parties, according to their Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For weekly play, we let our members know what servers we will be on, and what time, and then sort of host spaces for UCSB students to play,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The club is also reaching out to neighboring schools like UC Los Angeles and Cal Poly to host interconnected events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Doing these things online might give us the opportunity to meet up in person,” Huang said. “That’s definitely something to consider.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group also organizes teams for specific video games; tryouts for UCSB’s League of Legends A and B competition teams recently took place. The event invited all UCSB students to try out, including incoming freshmen and transfers, according to the group’s social media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huang emphasized how video games and the collaboration that Gaucho Gaming provides gives students the opportunity to connect and socialize during what can be a lonely isolation. Although video games sometimes get a negative reputation as an isolating activity, she explained, they can also be a force for good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being indoors more often has brought our online community together.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on Friday night</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to protest Floyd’s death.

Some noted that they had not originally planned to speak but became convinced to after seeing others do the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many speakers urged for allyship from non-Black communities and emphasized the need for people in a position of privilege to self-educate about the Black community’s struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black people are everywhere and deserve to feel safe everywhere,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers expressed discontent with the Black student experience at UCSB, noting a lack of resources and a small population of Black students, </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently at 5%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the undergraduate student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walk in I.V. and see what it feels like to have everybody staring at you for no damn reason,” one speaker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers shared personal accounts of police violence and fears that their Black loved ones could wrongly face violence or death at the hands of law enforcement. One speaker recounted a conversation with her younger sister in which her sister said she was afraid to go for a walk, or for her father to leave the house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I tried to tell her that she is safe, but I know in the back of my mind that that was not true. Even if she does everything right, even if she gives them no cause to bother her, there is a chance that she might become the victim of police brutality in this country just because of who she is,” the speaker said. </span></p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-94721-2-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94743\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94744\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94768\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94747\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94742\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94741\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94746\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94745\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94748\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94766\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethan Bertrand, a member of the I.V. Community Services District Board of Directors, recalled a conversation he had with his own father before his father visited I.V. for graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to say, ‘Dad, you’re an older black man walking around our community and some people may see you as a threat. Some people may not think that you belong here, which you do, but some people don’t understand that, so please be careful,’” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so hard for us to find the strength to battle through our tears to say that once again, we’re going to stand together and stand up,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers also stressed the need for Black voices to be heard and acknowledged by non-Black communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pay attention to Black voices. Stop trying to speak over us. Stop trying to tell us what the answer is,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several UCSB administrators were in attendance at the demonstration, including Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life; Aaron Jones, director of the Educational Opportunity Program; and Diana Collins Puente, director of community affairs, student development and leadership at UCSB’s Associated Students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s absence and lack of communication prior to the start of the march was widely criticized by participants. About halfway through the speeches, Yang sent out a mass email to the student body that addressed Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for those affected by his death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His words mean very little to me at this point,” one speaker said after reading aloud Yang’s statement to the crowd.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 1:30 p.m., protestors marched through I.V. chanting and holding homemade signs, as employees at local businesses observed from behind windows or stood outdoors to cheer on protestors. Once it reached Del Playa Drive, the crowd drew Isla Vistans out onto their balconies and into their yards. Some observers held their own signs and clapped for protestors, while others silently stared as the crowd marched toward Sands Beach, gathering more marchers along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surfers on bikes and families with children stood off to the side while protestors made their way down the dirt trail to Sands Beach, eventually gathering in a circle in a small field, where the demonstration’s organizers thanked the crowd for its solidarity and called for 30 seconds of silence to remember Floyd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those 30 seconds, protesters held their fists high in the air, some closing their eyes, the sound of the breaking waves the only noise.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
