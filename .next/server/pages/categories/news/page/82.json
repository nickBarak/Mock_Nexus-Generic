Bill Brown is the current Sheriff.</p>\n<p>In addition to the UCSB Lobby Corps, Santa Barbara City College, Allan Hancock College and Westmont College have been assisting CCIRC.</p>\n<p>According to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson, I.C.E. enforces immigration laws in the county and has a workspace in the county jail with access to inmates’ information.</p>\n<p>Jails, separate from prisons, are holding facilities used to confine people serving sentences for misdemeanors, awaiting trial or sentencing on either felony or misdemeanor charges or confined for civil matters.</p>\n<p>I.C.E. and jails work under the Truth Act, statewide legislation that creates more transparency in interactions between SBSO, I.C.E. and inmates.</p>\n<p>The Truth Act ensures that people in jail are aware of their rights to due process, legal counsel and that records relating to I.C.E. access must be open to the public.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if local law enforcement chooses to notify I.C.E. about an inmate’s release, the person and their attorney or designee must be notified of their release date and time as well.</p>\n<p>While organizations like CCIRC and Lobby Corps hope for an increase in strict enforcement of the Truth Act, they are lobbying to completely remove I.C.E. from prisons.</p>\n<p>Daniel Torres, a second-year history of public policy major and an organizer for Lobby Corps, said SBSO has been open about its “working relationship” with I.C.E., but said the Lobby Corps wants to “sever that connection” between the local jails and I.C.E.</p>\n<p>According to Frank Rodriguez, organizer of the Santa Barbara California Immigrant Policy Center which operates CCIRC, the county supervisors provide the funds and resources to the county jails.</p>\n<p>If CCIRC and the Lobby Corps can convince SBSO to limit I.C.E.’s work in the jails, county supervisors would then have the ability to restrict I.C.E.’s access to the jail’s computers and databases.</p>\n<p>Torres said the Lobby Corps and other organizations plan to work with Santa Barbara County Supervisors, and has already met with Fifth District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino to discuss the project.</p>\n<p>Lavagnino said, however, that although he disagrees with some immigration decisions made by the federal government, he believes immigration agents have an important role in county jails.</p>\n<p>“I thought everybody would agree that those that come to this country and have committed serious felonies, I thought everybody would approve of them being returned to their country,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Torres and Rodriguez, if the lobbying efforts are effective, the group could be discussing the next steps of the project with supervisors by March or April.</p>\n<p>Torres said it is important to work with the county supervisors and SBSO to “make sure undocumented stories are heard … and taken into account.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Community Services District (CSD), spoke at the meeting, saying the center has great potential to help I.V.</p>\n<p>“There are so many potential uses for the facility, and it can truly benefit the culture of Isla Vista, providing an outlet and a venue for positive activity,” he said.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, an I.V. resident since 2011 and board director for the I.V. Community Development Corporation (IVCDC), spoke during public comment to thank board members who have previously supported I.V.’s attempts to establish the community center.</p>\n<p>“From the abolition of the development agency to the granting of $485,000 in support of critical renovations to the building, the board has proven a steady ally to the sizable community of Isla Vista,” he said. “For that you have our appreciation.”</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock went on to list the possible uses for the building if the grant was acquired and funds were allocated to the center.</p>\n<p>“I believe all the residents will benefit from the sense of knowledge and community that comes from classes such as dancing or cooking or by sweating out the stresses of work and studying during live music shows,” he said.</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock also suggested the space could be used to host private events for a variety of members in the community, including quinceañeras and sorority and fraternity events.</p>\n<p>Skip Grey, assistant director of the Santa Barbara County General Services Department, is working on the application for the grant. Grey said that the grant will specifically be used for the I.V. Community Center.</p>\n<p>Grey said his department began working on this grant in December, and the application has already been completed. The Board of Supervisors’ motion Tuesday now authorizes Grey to submit the paperwork. He said the application is complete and due to the state on Feb. 23.</p>\n<p>According to Grey, the grant is competitive and is not awarded automatically. The winners of the grant are expected to be announced by June 30.</p>\n<p>General Services partnered with the County Community Services Department to complete the application because of its authority over affordable housing programs. General Services will perform the renovations on the community center if the funding is approved, though the two departments worked together to complete the request for funding.</p>\n<p>I.V. qualified for the grant due the number of affordable housing units built in recent years.<br>\n“Specifically, the grant rewards cities and counties that approve affordable housing programs and the County of Santa Barbara has done a good job of that,” Grey said.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, IVCDC and CSD board member, was not in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting but spoke to the Nexus on Monday to describe possible uses for the grant.</p>\n<p>If the grant was used to renovate the community center, Brandt said possible renovations could include replacing the roof of the building, creating a shade structure and possibly installing a garage-door-like opening on the side of the community center so that events could be held outdoors and indoors simultaneously.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

It is now part of the UCSB Horse Boarders Association (HBA).</p>\n<p>According to the updated LRDP, the area that houses the facility will be restored to natural wetlands, although the HBA says the area has not functioned as a wetland in hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>Members are concerned the property is being used as “leverage” for the university to gain approval on future development projects from the California Coastal Commission (CCC).</p>\n<p>UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, said, however, that the stable is located on environmentally sensitive area of campus.</p>\n<p>“Due to the sensitive nature of the area, the California Coastal Commission has required the campus to plan for the removal of the stable facilities,” she said. “They have given us 10 years to remove the facility.”</p>\n<p>Estrada said the university also submitted a Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015, to allow possible relocation of the horse stables. The report outlines the monthly removal of manure from community horse arenas, efforts to minimize runoff to the wetlands and that horse stalls be cleaned weekly and communal areas (such as turnouts) be cleaned four times a week.</p>\n<p>Jenny Dugan, UCSB associate research biologist and HBA faculty advisor, works very closely with the CCC and submitted the Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015.</p>\n<p>Holly Nuovo, senior environmental studies major and treasurer of HBA, considers the plan pivotal to UCSB’s sustainability plan. “I know they include our manure tonnage in their sustainability reports, so whenever they’re talking about waste management, part of that is about us,” she said.</p>\n<p>The all natural and organic manure is donated to the Indigenous Gardening Club and other gardening communities in the area, making the reuse of the manure beneficial to UCSB’s sustainability plan.</p>\n<p>The CCC is a state organization that regulates the university’s developments. They aim to protect environmentally sensitive habitats, requiring the university to restore one area in tandem with any new development in the coastal area, like the Sierra Madre housing. The CCC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>The HBA has been active since the 1970s and has been fighting forced closures by the university since the 1990s.

We are doing it now,” Nuovo said.</p>\n<p>Existing restrictions to build in the area because of native burial sites and environmental concerns make the area convenient to use as “leverage,” Nuovo said. Pressure from UC Regents to make campuses larger put the university in a position to follow through with the closure.</p>\n<p>It would take roughly 20 years or more for the area to be restored as a wetland. The slough does not naturally reach the facility, so major excavations would occur for water to reach the area.</p>\n<p>“They use this land as a tool to return to the environment, but I honestly feel that what we do here helps the students integrate into the environment and the community at whole so much better than just returning it straight to wetland,” Nouvo said, adding that the facility offers affordable horse boarding opportunities to students that could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75806\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75806\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/","id":2720,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2719,2718,2717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Goings-On in Isla Vista This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This week's Vista Point includes challah baking, \"Not My President's Day\" march downtown and KCSB's 55th anniversary.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>KCSB’s 55th ANNIVERSARY</strong><br>\nUCSB’s radio station is celebrating its 55th year broadcasting independent radio to Isla Vista and Santa Barbara.

Currently, new A.S. fees that are on the ballot by student petition need only 51 percent to be added, while fees that are put on by Senate need 60 percent. The referendum would increase the votes necessary for all new fees to two-thirds.</p>\n<p>This referendum also makes it more difficult for student fees to be increased and reaffirmed. Existing lock-in fees must be reaffirmed every two years. The new legislation would mandate that fees that are up for reaffirmation must pass by 60 percent, while fees on the ballot for an increase must pass by 66 percent.</p>\n<p>These amendments will be sent to Elections Committee and will go through Senate at the end of the quarter before being sent to the UC Office of the President.</p>\n<p>The final bylaw proposes a cap on the amount spent by the Finance and Business Committee on conferences.</p>\n<p>Currently, A.S. Financial Policies and Procedures do not allow non-A.S. organizations to use A.S. funds for expenses related to off-campus conferences. Organizations that want to use funding for conferences can use a one-time exception allowing them to get the funding they need.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t make sense that a huge portion of the finance and business budget goes towards an exception to the rules. We need to either modify the rules or limit spending,” Ian Caples, A.S.

In previous years, around $80,000 was allocated towards conferences.</p>\n<p>Finance and Business Committee Chair Reilly Hobson emphasized that the goal of this bylaw was not to decrease student fees but to limit the amount of money spent off campus.</p>\n<p>“I think students don’t realize that the money that Finance and Business Committee has is coming from student fees,” Hobson said. “They think it’s from the university, and then we have to dispense it. It’s actually from students, so when they’re asking for like $600 per student to go to a conference, that’s like three people paying for one person to go.”</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, co-chair of the A.S. Queer Commission, said he believes a cap on conference spending will negatively affect minority students.</p>\n<p>“I think that limiting the spending on conferences is very detrimental to a lot of minority communities because a lot of the learning and community building and healing come from going to conferences,” Dumlao said. “I think in trying to limit that you are, in turn, oppressing the communities that you say you are supporting.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate is expected to vote on the conference cap on Wednesday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Last year’s election season saw the emergence of four new parties: The Response, Peer Action Coalition (P.A.C.), Campus United (CU) and Queer and Trans Student Body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU became the dominant party in April, garnering 64 percent of the Senate and three out of five executive seats. The Response won seven seats on the Senate, and P.A.C. took the remaining two seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would not wish to see something like that happen again. In my opinion, you would have it so that no one has the majority,” said Nawar Nemeh, third-year political science major and Isla Vista Party executive member. “That doesn’t mean we’re not going to try to dominate. That would be stupid of us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nemeh, many of Isla Vista Party’s members were active in P.A.C. and The Response last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an obvious overlap. I don’t think that’s an unfair assessment,” Nemeh said. He added that the party includes students with no previous experience in A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are about 40 active members in the Isla Vista Party, according to Nemeh. He said many of them represent the Black Student Union, El Congreso, Queer Commission, Multicultural Greek Council, UCSB Panhellenic and Inter-Fraternity Council, among other groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how the Isla Vista Party differentiates itself from others, on-campus senator Lesly Silva said the party is “grassroots” and “diverse.” Party members have not yet formed their platform, she said, because they are in the process of gathering input from a range of “historically underrepresented communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We reach out to communities asking, what do you need? … What has been on your mind?” she said. “This is a community-based party.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a second-year global studies major, said party members contacted his group, the Queer Commission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the past, it’s been an afterthought where people have created their parties and then came to the queer communities,” he said. “We really get a say on what the party is doing, and so we get that foundational support instead of support that we would get as an afterthought.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aim of the Isla Vista Party, Nemeh said, is to change the structure of Senate so that students have increased “decision-making power” at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citing the UC shared governance policy, which splits campus responsibility evenly between students, faculty and administration, Nemeh said students have “gotten the short end of the deal recently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want is to make sure that students have an actual decision-making power that’s not just one seat on an advisory committee. We want them to actually be the decision-makers,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Lopez, off-campus senator and third-year sociology and economics double major, said the goal of this party is to elect student government officials who will use the power invested in them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to actually put people in positions where they will have a big influence and will use that influence, rather than putting people into a position because the title sounds nice,” Lopez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nemeh, the name of the party is intended to localize the interests of A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to remind people, what do we actually love? What is actually our home? It’s Isla Vista,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU will continue to run a full slate for this spring election. According to Niki Elyasi, a CU organizer and fourth-year biopsychology major, her party will maintain its same mission and values, even with the formation of a new party.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every year there’s more than one party. It’s definitely more competitive than when there’s only one party running,” she said. “I don’t see that changing Campus United style or Campus United mission. I don’t think you’ll see anything different from us. It’s up to the different parties what you’ll see from them.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/","id":2435,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2434,2433,2432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Woman Sexually Assaulted on Estero Road","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ivfp.jpg?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ivfp.jpg?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1","description":"A woman was reportedly sexually assaulted in Isla Vista on Saturday, according to a university crime alert Sunday from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A woman was reportedly sexually assaulted in Isla Vista on Saturday, according to a university crime alert Sunday from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police said the assault occurred when a woman who was lost walked into a residence on the 6700 block of Estero Road Saturday afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to police, a male subject assaulted a woman at the residence that afternoon between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The woman was able to leave with the help of some friends, police said, and she reported the sexual assault to the I.V.

Headshots were discouraged, but not prohibited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplicity allowed several bystanders to immediately join in and participate in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just fun. If anyone else could come out here, be silly, hit each other with foam swords and get a pretty good workout … it’s pretty good,” Fraczek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spanning over two hours, the warriors alternated among games of shirts versus skins, king of the hill, capture the flag and one-versus-one. Several warriors flung their arms around and slowly fell after being hit by a finishing blow, emphasizing the worthiness of their defeat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunter McCoole, a communication major currently taking a hiatus from school, was walking her dog when she saw the warriors fighting outside her house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It looks like it was played safe. Everyone looked super stoked, and I think it’s great that everyone came outdoors and just had fun instead of being inside and studying,” McCoole said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 30 minutes of the LARP, Police Officer Andy Radujko stopped by on his motorcycle and took out his baton, jokingly ready to battle with the rest of the warriors.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radujko used to engage in a similar activity during high school and said it was great that Excursion Club was hosting the event. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75725\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75725\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/","id":4471,"author":{"id":99,"name":"Parry Dong"},"related":[4470,4469,4468],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Weekly Goings-On in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Valentines, anti-Valentines, free food, a capella for a good cause and more this week in I.V.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>SUCCULENTS<br>\nSanta Barbara Hillel will be hosting a Paint N’ Plant event to celebrate the Tu B’Shevat holiday.

Half of the funding will come from the public works department and the other half from UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The project will begin in late summer, and the department estimates the project will take four to six weeks. The county will determine a specific start date after removing pre-existing streetlight infrastructure at the intersection.</p>\n<p>Given the high traffic at the intersection, the construction will occur almost entirely on the sidewalk area. Some street shoulders are expected to be closed.</p>\n<p>The intersection has two stop signs for northbound and southbound traffic, giving eastbound and westbound traffic the right of way at all times.</p>\n<p>An increase in bike and car traffic over the years contributed to the change. Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, presented the project at an I.V. Community Network Meeting in January.</p>\n<p>“This project should provide a much more orderly and functional intersection, safely integrating bicycle, pedestrian and auto traffic,” George Thurlow, the university’s liaison for I.V. affairs, said.</p>\n<p>The original plan involved the installation of two traffic signals, one at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte and the other at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p>The county determined that only one signal was necessary with the hope that the signal on Embarcadero Del Norte will cause sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic at the Embarcadero Del Mar intersection.</p>\n<p>The county also proposed a four-way stop and a roundabout for this intersection, but officials concluded that neither would be able to safely sustain the amount of people on bikes coming through the intersection.</p>\n<p>“It really came down to a traffic signal,” McGolpin said. “It will allow the bikes that are coming out of the campus to see the red bulb and slow down a little bit and allow the signal to go through a 15–20-second cycle. It’s definitely going to be new for I.V.”</p>\n<p>Pegeen Soutar, the I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District board chair and a 35-year I.V. resident, said she has noticed cars and delivery trucks having difficulty crossing while students ride their bicycles during the busiest times of the day.</p>\n<p>“Safety is the biggest concern,” she said. “Whatever is put there, I hope people are paying attention and being careful.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story previously said the stoplight was funded by a grant. The Santa Barbara County Public Works Department and UCSB provided funding. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75599\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75599\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/","id":4469,"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher"},"related":[4468,4467,4466],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Surf Report: Feb. 10 to 12","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sands-Beach_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sands-Beach_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"When are the swells swell?

Knew you’d be back again for the inside on catching the insides this weekend. Now, because of the overwhelming demand on my surf expertise, I have decided to bless ya with yet another completely accurate compilation of my surf report. If y’all didn’t catch that last bit of sarcasm, I wish you the best with reading the rest of this and hope you know these are surf predictions, not something to bet your life on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, let’s move on to the nitty gritty. Now, the west-northwest swell (WNW) is making an appearance this weekend, meaning those ocean storms are still blowing over here. It’s not the strongest surge, but it’s definitely causing some waves for us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let’s take a look at the three amigos, shall we?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday: best swells, worst weather; 4-6 feet, largest waves in the p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday: average swells, average weather; 3-5 feet, better surf in the a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday: eh swells, but great weather; 1-3 feet all day</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, before you go running off asking the paddle boarders for some wax (please don’t), let me warn you about the rain coming on Friday. Oftentimes, rain means bacterial runoff being really present in the water during and after first day of rain. I know your surfing urges plunge you into the water despite possible sickness, but please be careful. Take care of yourself for finals, okay? Don’t say I never warned the freshies.

She said the university hopes to end construction in June.</p>\n<p>Sue Hawkins, director of UCen Dining services, confirmed the project is ongoing, but said the university’s standard approval process has delayed the store’s opening.</p>\n<p>Hernandez also said the contracts between the university and Starbucks have required several drafts because “the campus is extremely careful in the execution of all contracts.” She added that the contract with Starbucks went through several iterations.</p>\n<p>Marc Fisher, associate vice chancellor for campus design and facilities, said an important part of the review was a comparison to similar contracts between Starbucks and at other UC campuses.</p>\n<p>The process was extended longer than anticipated, but he also said the university is now ready to bid for construction.</p>\n<p>As for the new Starbucks’ appearance, Fisher said the store will be consistent with other locations.<br>\n“The design of our store is custom, but very much a Starbucks image and layout,” Fisher said in an email. “Starbucks, as you know, strives to provide a high quality product in an environment that is consistent with their brand.”</p>\n<p>As reported by the Nexus in May, the UCen is facing financial trouble and will look to the new Starbucks location to alleviate some of the building’s economic burden.</p>\n<p>In May of 2016, the Nexus <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/officials-new-starbucks-to-aid-struggling-ucen/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that the UCen had a year-end deficit of nearly $750,000.

Attendance during the following two years was “dramatically lower.”<em> Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The advertisements will appear on Pandora, Facebook and television in the weeks leading up to Deltopia, which typically takes place on the first weekend after spring break.</p>\n<p>According to Chuck Haines, the acting assistant chancellor for the Office of Budget and Planning, the funding for these advertisements comes from unrestricted gift funds, which are donations made by alumni.</p>\n<p>He said the university spent $41,000 in advertising for Deltopia and $30,000 for Halloween last year. According to Haines, UCSB typically runs these campaigns for three to four weeks, spending $10,000 per week of advertising.</p>\n<p>Students throughout California have reported hearing Pandora ads dissuading them from travelling to Santa Barbara for festivities held on both Deltopia and Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>Alongside the Deltopia ad campaign, the university also contributes $15,000 per year to the much larger countywide “Keep Isla Vista Safe” campaign that runs television and radio advertisements year-round.</p>\n<p>According to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada, UCSB shares the cost of “Keep Isla Vista Safe” with local agencies including the City of Goleta, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff and Santa Barbara City College.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, campaign organizers posted a video on their Facebook page warning viewers that attending Deltopia could potentially result in mugshots.</p>\n<p>The video also cautions viewers of the 300-officer police force, extra DUI checkpoints and severe parking restrictions. The hashtags #LocalsOnlyBrah and #StillPayingForIt were widely circulated on the page in preparation for last year’s Deltopia.</p>\n<p>The Nexus reported in April that students spoke out against “Keep Isla Vista Safe,” saying that the campaign received no input from students and inaccurately portrayed Isla Vista. The UCSB Task Force Against Police Brutality and the Black Student Union also held silent demonstrations at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Office of Student Affairs also sends letters to local high school and middle school principals discouraging young Isla Vistans from attending party weekends.</p>\n<p>The office sends a similar letter to college students in California detailing potential risks that Deltopia poses, such as severe parking restrictions, police presence and increased law and ordinance enforcement. Debbie Fleming, the assistant vice chancellor of student affairs, oversees the letters.</p>\n<p>“This letter goes to my counterpart at all the other UC campuses, and we ask for it to be distributed to students,” Fleming said. “We have a list of other California colleges that includes schools from which students have been arrested or cited in Isla Vista during past years.”</p>\n<p>The Office of Student Affairs additionally sends UCSB students emails with safety information prior to events such as Halloween and Deltopia that emphasize the university’s policy on visitors. Residence halls do not permit students to have guests during that timeframe. The university also runs ads in the <em>Nexus</em> and <em>The Bottom Line.</em></p>\n<p>The EVPLA office, which participates in the “Keep Isla Vista Local” campaign, sent postcards to each address in I.V. prior to Halloween weekend, in addition to communicating safety information before both Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Deltopia 2015 and 2016 witnessed a significant decrease in attendance paired with a drop in the number of arrests and citations.</p>\n<p>In a statement released on the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office Facebook page, authorities reported that last year’s turnout of 3,500 people was “dramatically lower” than the 10,000 people who were estimated to have attended in 2015 and the 20,000 to 25,000 people who attended in 2014.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board also holds a spring concert restricted only to UCSB students, which prevents visitors from attending.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a lot of really positive feedback from students who like having a fun alternative that is for UCSB students only,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/","id":2431,"author":{"id":102,"name":"Deepika Chandrashekar"},"related":[2430,2429,2428],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Christina Lim Remembered as ‘Everyone’s Friend’","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-09-at-11.09.45-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-09-at-11.09.45-AM.png?resize=684%2C559&ssl=1","description":"\"You could talk to her about anything at any time.

She formed a tight circle of friends while she was at UCSB, infecting acquaintances with her positivity and open mindedness.</p>\n<p>“She was always smiling,” Rod Gomez, a fourth-year environmental science major who met Lim when they were second-year students, said.</p>\n<p>While juggling a full course load in the engineering department, Lim managed a job at Curvature, paid her own bills and was always open to adventure. At Curvature, coworkers were impressed by her work ethic, and Lim had plans to continue working in Santa Barbara after graduating in June.</p>\n<p>Lim loved melodic dubstep beats and electronic dance music, especially the producer Seven Lions. She tried her hand at DJing for fun, friends said, and she was an avid supporter of her friend’s musical pursuits.</p>\n<p>Raghav Thirumulu, Lim’s housemate and close friend, said she had an impressive talent for video games, beating her friends at games she had just picked up. She also entertained an obsession with several television shows, including “Westworld,” “Black Mirror” and “The Walking Dead.”</p>\n<p>“She just gave off this energy that made your day so much easier,” Ming Guo, who also lived with Lim, said.</p>\n<p>Evelyn Choi met Lim during her first year, and soon considered her a best friend and a sister. The first night they met in Anacapa Residence Hall, the two fell asleep while talking and studying in the lounge. A custodial worker woke them up several hours later, and “From then on, I knew she was going to be someone really important in my life,” Choi said.</p>\n<p>Over four years, Choi became accustomed to Lim’s quirks — including her keen interest in World War II. Lim had posters of “Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific” throughout her room, and she considered the era one of the rawest moments in human emotion.</p>\n<p>Lim was also given a few goofy nicknames: “Chrispitos,” named after crispy taquitos, and “Christinith,” referencing the movie “The Other Guys.”</p>\n<p>Landon Peik, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major, met Lim for the first time at Hard Summer music festival. He remembers Choi leaning on Lim’s shoulder for the duration of a set by Porter Robinson, enjoying her friends’ company with their favorite music.</p>\n<p>College was a transformational time for Lim, her friends said, and she was always happy to go on hiking trips, to music festivals and spend time with people. She made her friends feel comfortable, while always challenging them with new ideas.</p>\n<p>Armando Muñoz, one of Lim’s housemates, described her as “one of the guys.”</p>\n<p>“You could talk to her about anything, at any time,” he said. “She was always down to listen and give advice. She could take it and dish it better than most guys.”</p>\n<p>Lim was extremely humble about her intelligence through years of hard work, friends said, and she never complained, even on her first 13-mile hike through the Sequoia Woods.</p>\n<p>Chris Tuch, a UCSB alumnus, met Lim as a resident assistant in Anacapa Residence Hall. The two were close, often staying up for hours watching Netflix shows, talking and playing Nintendo 64 games.<br>\n“She was a homie,” he said.</p>\n<p>The group of friends this week received an outpouring of support from neighbors, friends and students who crossed paths with Lim. Thirumulu created a donation page Monday in her honor which quickly exceeded the target goal of $5,000, raising over $8,139 in two days.</p>\n<p>Friends will hold a memorial in Lim’s honor this weekend, playing her favorite music to celebrate her life. Anyone who is interested in attending can contact Thirumulu at<em> rrthirumulu@gmail.com</em>. Lim’s family will also arrange a funeral ceremony later this month.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75595\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75595\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/","id":2433,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2432,2431,2430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senators Bianca Fernandez and Batsheva Stoll first proposed the resolution to the Senate on Jan. 18. It passed Wednesday 21 to 2.</p>\n<p>The IIE Syria Consortium is a scholarship program designed to allocate admission space at universities to refugees whose education has been halted by the Syrian War. The Consortium aims to help refugee students continue their education at universities so they can eventually return to Syria and begin rebuilding their communities.</p>\n<p>Syrian students are unable to continue their education in Syria because their campuses are either destroyed or unsafe. The war has displaced over four million people, with as many as 450,000 between the ages of 18 and 22.</p>\n<p>The resolution was originally brought to the senators by Books Not Bombs, a campaign that encourages universities to join the IIE Syria Consortium. The same resolution has been proposed at other UC campuses and at the UC Student Association.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be the fourth school in the UC system to petition the Regents to join the Consortium, following Davis, Irvine and Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Bianca Fernandez, off-campus senator and second-year history of public policy major, said the university’s participation in the IIE Syria Consortium would show that UCSB is supportive of refugee students and their higher education.</p>\n<p>“Having the UC system give that opportunity and be that school that will help, indirectly, Syria rebuild itself [is] super important, and I think it’s a very progressive step for our school,” she said.</p>\n<p>The Syrian students’ financial aid will come from funding that is already reserved for international students, so U.S. students will not be affected by the resolution.</p>\n<p>However, Syrian students will receive priority admission to the university over other international students due to the severity of their country’s crisis.</p>\n<p>The resolution was drafted before President Trump’s immigration ban, which complicates the process of Syrian students getting to UCSB. The president’s executive order temporarily bans immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and proposes the indefinite suspension of Syrian refugees from entering the country.</p>\n<p>Fernandez said she believes the resolution is still valuable despite Trump’s order because it demonstrates the university’s dedication to continuing the education of refugee students.</p>\n<p>“I still think it is super important that the UC system, especially UCSB, shows that we are accepting of Syrian refugees and we want to have a space for them on this campus,” she said. “We think it’s very important that students in Syria receive the higher education that they deserve.”</p>\n<p>The president’s immigration ban is currently being reviewed for constitutionality by federal judges. The executive order was temporarily blocked last Friday by a federal judge from Seattle.</p>\n<p>Fernandez said Syrian students’ presence at UCSB will provide “different viewpoints” on campus and make the campus “an even better place.”</p>\n<p>“They’ll make our campus more diverse and I think that’s something our campus is really proud of,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75602\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75602\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/","id":2434,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2433,2432,2431],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":82,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
