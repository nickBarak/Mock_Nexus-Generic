According to Harris, the $8,304 funding the BSU received is going toward covering the two-day program and informational documents for parents and students on campus. Harris said the outreach program is the only program that prioritizes African American students.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60678\" style=\"width: 344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60678\" data-attachment-id=\"60678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/finance-and-business-committee-hears-from-groups/finance-board-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=5472%2C3648&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5472,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423457519\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60678\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3-1024x683.jpg?resize=334%2C222\" alt=\"Committee members hear students' proposals for funding.

Will be bussed to campus and introduced to the university’s college environment.</p>\n<p>“For a lot of them, or most of them or really all of them sometimes, this is the first time they are ever going to see college students or let alone a college campus at all,” Harris said.<br>\nAccording to dance event coordinator and third-year linguistics major David Shen, the Swing Ballroom Dance Club’s Swing Fling Spring Dance on April 25 will feature Captain Cardiac and the Coronaries, a band that has performed at three Super Bowls and at the Cotton Bowl.</p>\n<p>“Last year, when they played for us at the same Spring event we had the largest turnout we have had at any dance historically,” Shen said. “We had over 400 people in the SRB — it was a lot but it was fantastic.”</p>\n<p>The Communication Association did not receive $1,035 for their annual internship mixer at Corwin Pavilion on Feb. 24 because of a charge for non-members to attend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Yang, Mitragotri is well-deserving of the prestigious election.</p>\n<p>“Election to the Academy by one’s peers is one of the highest recognitions for an engineer, an acknowledgment of outstanding and pioneering research,” Yang said. “This distinction joins a long list of Samir’s other well-deserved honors and accomplishments.”</p>\n<p>Mitragotri said he believes a large part of his recognition is due to the students and research group members who work with him.</p>\n<p>“I really want to thank my students and my research group,” Mitragotri said. “They are the ones who do the hard work on a day-to-day basis, and the work that is recognized is really their doing.”</p>\n<p>With his membership, Mitragotri said he looks forward to conferring with other engineers on making decisions for the future of the engineering field.</p>\n<p>“It’s really an opportunity to participate in the future discussions of engineering at the national level,” Mitragotri said, “That could really be the key benefit and the key outcome of this election.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemical engineering major Zach Sawaya said Mitragotri’s election is unsurprising, given the reputation of the university’s engineering programs.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t surprise me in the slightest, but it makes me very excited,” Sawaya said. “This appointment is simply an indication of the excellent faculty and students … and a reason we have one of the top chemical engineering departments in the country.”</p>\n<p>“Really, it’s representative of UCSB science as a whole,” Sawaya said. “We are a top science university.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/","id":2907,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2906,2905,2904],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Discuss I.V.

Week”</p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) held a public forum on Isla Vista housing at the Pardall Center Thursday night as part of “I.V. Week,” a series of events created to draw attention to issues related to history, culture, environment, housing and community in I.V.</p>\n<p>During Thursday’s event, attendees shared their experiences renting in I.V. and discussed challenges they have faced with housing prices, management and availability. Attendees then brainstormed various I.V. housing issues to send to university administration and local government officials, including overcrowded housing, rising rental costs, unresponsive landlords and poorly maintained buildings.</p>\n<p>Forum organizer and second-year history major Paola Villegas said she thinks the university is out of touch with housing issues in I.V. and wants to take sentiments expressed at the forum to administrators.</p>\n<p>“There’s a sense, at least from what I’ve heard, that the university doesn’t think there’s a housing crisis in Isla Vista,” Villegas said. “We want to gather stories and facts to show them that there really is a housing crisis.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and second-year history of public policy major Paola De La Cruz said communication between administrators and I.V. residents about housing issues in I.V. is crucial to prompting change.</p>\n<p>“There are many of them [administrators] who believe that there is no housing crisis in Isla Vista,” De La Cruz said. “What we need to do now is really voice our personal issues and list demands for them to address and things that we can do. I don’t think we need someone to come in and save us. This is why we’re meeting here, for us to just do things.”</p>\n<p>Citing her personal experience with housing problems in I.V. as an example, De La Cruz said she was denied a lease because of her parents’ citizenship status when she tried to rent in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Both of my parents are residents, they’re not citizens, and for one of the applications they had to be citizens so my application was denied,” De La Cruz said. “I remember complaining, ‘Why would you reject my applications simply because my parents are residents?’ I am a citizen.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major and IVCRC external chair Daniela Bayon said she has experienced insect infestations and unresponsive apartment management while renting in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I had cockroaches in my second-year apartment and they kept blaming us as tenants even though we didn’t keep trash in the apartment,” Bayon said. “They said, ‘Oh, we sprayed,’ even though they couldn’t provide proof that they engaged in any type of corrective action to make our housing more sanitary.”</p>\n<p>According to Bayon, one possible strategy to solving challenges regarding housing issues in I.V. is to educate students about I.V. housing rights before renting.</p>\n<p>“Maybe during orientation or at the end of students living in the dorms the university [the university] could send out an email or have a training with documents,” Bayon said, “Because the Isla Vista Tenants Union does have all these documents ready and it might be the case that the university can make a publicity campaign regarding knowing your rights as tenants.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I understand we are a beach college but a lot of Greeks are the most intimidated by the LGBTQ community.”</p>\n<p>Escobar-Henry said publicly admitting your sexual orientation as gay can lead to negativity from those who oppose the gay community.</p>\n<p>“I feel that ‘coming out’ is definitely a gateway to have hatred towards you,” Escobar-Henry said. “The hatred comes from ignorance and making jokes out of LGBTQ people in the media and public.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English and film &amp; media studies major Chloe Babauta also spoke on the panel and said because of her bisexual identity she has been followed and verbally assaulted in I.V.</p>\n<p>“One time, I was walking down the street in Isla Vista with a girl,” Babauta said. “I was holding her hand and was followed. Another time, I was with my lesbian friends and men tried to make me make-out with them. I felt threatened and in danger. This is why I do not party in Isla Vista anymore.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60634\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60634\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/","id":2911,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2910,2909,2908],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Town Hall Meeting Discusses I.V.

Attendees were asked to join different groups in order to discuss current issues facing I.V. in a small setting and then afterward presented their findings to the larger audience. The groups focused on potential services that could be offered by an I.V.-specific CSD, included improved plans for parking and transportation, planning, housing, health and wellness, arts and culture, infrastructure, community advocates, a community center, lighting and public safety.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hillel Executive Director Rabbi Evan Goodman opened the event and said Hillel has hosted a number of community organizing events related to self-governance from last Spring quarter to present day.</p>\n<p>“We feel it is very important that the community, the members of this community, the students in the community at large take responsibility for our community to make it a better place,” Goodman said, “So, little by little, we are moving the ball down the field.”</p>\n<p>Community organizer Darcel Elliott, who kicked off the forum with a discussion on services related to law enforcement, said policing practices in I.V. need to be “proactive”.</p>\n<p>“Since the population has grown and the number of officers has stayed relatively steady, there has been more reactive policing as opposed to proactive,” Elliott said, “So we were talking about a need for someone who is dedicated just to proactive policing, and we also talked about the expansion of the CSO program, which is the community service officers on campus.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60590\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60590\" data-attachment-id=\"60590\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/town-hall-meeting-discusses-i-v-infrastructure/a-member-of-the-ucpd-discusses-public-safety-issues/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-4.jpg?fit=5472%2C3648&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5472,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"A member of the UCPD discusses public safety issues.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423122619\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"A member of the UCPD discusses public safety issues.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Self Gov Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-4.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60590\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-4-1024x683.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"A member of the UCPD discusses public safety issues.

Internal Vice President Angela Lau discussed the Student Health Board’s plan to reduce financial aid for students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance.</p>\n<p>“What they want to do is reduce financial aid packages for students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance. Currently around 50 percent of students waive Gaucho health insurance,” said Lau. “However they don’t account for the fact that currently, to be a student at UCSB you are required to have health insurance.”</p>\n<p>According to Lau, the Student Health Board’s new plan will financially hurt students, many of whom struggle to pay for tuition and school expenses already.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t really make sense to reduce financial aid for not having Gaucho Health Insurance when you’re making every student have it,” Lau said, “Essentially that means that they’re penalizing students for not using the Gaucho Health Insurance brand by reducing their financial aid package.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting Senator Zach Goulhiane of the UCen Governance Board reported that changes are being made to the campus mail system so that first-year students living in the Santa Catalina dorms will have to collect their mail at the UCen post office.</p>\n<p>“They’re planning on spending $93,000 to re-do pretty much all the P.O. boxes for the freshmen so all the FT mailboxes, all the University-owned mailboxes will be moved here [the UCen],” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>According to Goulhaine, the move is directed to increase foot traffic around UCen businesses and to simplify mail distribution.</p>\n<p>“They’re trying to get more traffic into the UCen so that more people will go around the bookstore and whatnot buying stuff here,” Goulhiane said, “And that way they centralize all the mail because now apparently it takes them a while to send it out.”</p>\n<p>Also during meeting, A.S. Recycling Program member Sam Breyfogle outlined the organization’s proposal to update recycling bin signs to reflect a new comingled recycling program that aims to provide specific instructions for waste management. The proposal is seeking funds from The Green Initiative Fund, a student-supported fund that funds eco-friendly projects on campus.</p>\n<p>“They [bins] were installed about 20 years ago. They currently say ‘newspapers, aluminum, plastic,’ and ‘glass’ as well as ‘trash,’” Breyfogle said. “We’d like to get signs that say ‘comingled recycling’ and underneath that a sign that lists out what can be recycled.”</p>\n<p>Breyfogle also said the organization wants to upgrade the BigBelly trashcans on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’d like to buy new bins for the interiors of the berthas,” Breyfogle said, “Many of the bins have holes bit through by rodents causing them to leak and make a complete mess of the interior.”</p>\n<p>After further discussion surrounding Gaucho Health Insurance, the Senate heard from A.S. Controller Amir Khazaieli about updates surrounding the iClicker rental program.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli explained that the goal is to make iClickers free for students to rent, but there will be a suggested $5 donation upon returning the iClicker to keep the program sustainable.</p>\n<p>“Based off our research, students are highly inclined if not really ecstatic to provide up to $5 to the association for providing such a service if it meant that that money was going to go to expanding such a service,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli addressed the specific concern of the $7 re-registration fee for students on used iClickers and suggested that donations generated from the $5 program could reduce the fee. Khazaieli also suggested potentially “striking a deal” with iClicker to get reduced rates.</p>\n<p>A.S. will be holding a finance meeting on Monday to “secure funding for the program,” according to Khazaieli.</p>\n<p>“If revenues are generated from the iClicker program … that money can go towards subsidizing this,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>The meeting concluded with senators passing two resolutions in support of a tuition hike op-ed and a BigBelly label and bin upgrade.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the February 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily

<em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Two professors from McGill University and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies gave keynote lectures at the Mosher Alumni House to celebrate the opening of the Confucius Institute on campus yesterday.</p>\n<p>The first lecture, “Globalizing Regions: the Spread of Southeast Chinese Daoist Ritual Traditions to Southeast Asia,” was given by East Asian Studies Professor Kenneth Dean of McGill University. Immediately following Dean, Professor of Trade &amp; Economic Diplomacy at the Middlebury Institute and Institute for Trade and Commercial Diplomacy President Robert Rogowsky gave a lecture entitled, “U.S.-China Trade Policy: Productive Collaboration or Managed Rivalry?” Religious studies professor and Cultural Studies Director of the Confucius Institute Mayfair Yang began the meeting by giving a summary about what the opening of the Confucius Institute means for the university.</p>\n<p>“We will emphasis academics and research more than most Confucius institutes,” Yang said, “We still will be in the business of educating the public, promoting China studies, strengthening understanding of Chinese history, culture, society, religion, philosophy, literature, economics, and politics.”</p>\n<p>During the lecture Dean discussed the background of Southeast Asia’s cultural history presented his findings from his long-term ethnographic studies focused on Southeast China. According to Dean, ethnic communities with distinct dialects provide cultural benefits to its surrounding region.</p>\n<p>“The dialect communities provide a lot of strength and resources for communities,” Dean said.</p>\n<p>Afterward Rogowsky gave a lecture on the trade relationship between the U.S. and China, highlighting economic issues brought about by China’s rapid industrialization.</p>\n<p>“The growth of the middle class in China and in particular Asia is huge,” Rogowsky said. “It’s good but is also somewhat problematic. Problematic in the sense that people in the middle class eat a lot more than people who are poor … so it increases the demand for food tremendously.”</p>\n<p>Vice Director of Confucius Institute Professor Lijuan Zhang ended the meeting with closing statements about the opening of the Confucius Institute and the value of its research.</p>\n<p>“[There is] lots of debate on Chinese issues but there is one consensus that I think everyone would agree,” Zhang said, “that it’s worth the research about China.”</p>\n<p>Second-year religious studies graduate student Sarah Veeck said she was interested in Dean’s analysis on the changes in the Putian plain over the last hundred years.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of depth. There also with the transnational connections continuing to impact local religion in China,” Veeck said. “I would be interested in dong long-term ethnographic study on a community that does rely on local temple associations to provide assistance for education, infrastructure projects, funerals for people who can’t afford them.”</p>\n<p>Yang said Dean offered a historical perspective of Fujian that maintained a locally-oriented account of its regional impact throughout Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>“Professor Rogowsky’s talk had a very powerful global perspective that really serves the global studies academic community here on campus,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the two keynote speeches illustrated the Confucius Institute’s as well as China’s “globally important” role on campus and in the world.</p>\n<p>“It’s a dynamically changing society.” Yang said. “All these global transnational problems, you need China on board. You need to engage with China. Just because you don’t agree on a few things doesn’t mean you cannot include China because China is a dynamic society. It can help the rest of the world a great deal.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60483\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60483\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/confucius-institute-presents-first-lectures/","id":2906,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[2905,2904,2903],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Art Professor Shares Images of Jailed Youth as First Event of UCSB Reads 2015","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Art professor and photographer Richard Ross spoke about his newly published book Girls in Justice as well as his work documenting incarcerated youth in detention facilities across the country Tuesday ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60471\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60471\" data-attachment-id=\"60471\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984524\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"62\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60471\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-3-1024x682.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"UCSB Art Professor shared his photographs and experiences from his experience documenting incarcerated youth in the United States from his books Youth In Justice and Girls In Justice as the first event of UCSB Reads 2015.

Photographs published in his earlier book<em> Juvenile in Justice</em> have been on exhibit nationwide and used as a tool for advocates for juvenile justice system reform. Images from his new book are currently on display on the first floor of the library.</p>\n<p>Ross, who previously worked as a photographer for <em>Time Magazine</em>, <em>Newsweek</em> and the<em> New York Times</em>, said he wants his exhibits and books to spark change in the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“I’m not a judge; I’m not a probation officer. I’m an artist; I’m a human being,” Ross said. “I decided with my work I’m going to use art as a weapon.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids. – Art professor and photographer Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Ross, one of the underlying issues within the juvenile justice system is that “as a society, we bully kids.”</p>\n<p>“If you bully someone who is a person of color, you might get some pushback, you might be sued,” Ross said. “Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while there have been improvements made in the system since the publication of <em>Juvenile in Justice</em> three years ago, the situation for incarcerated girls has worsened.</p>\n<p>“The population of girls increases in relation to boys and girls have unique problems,” Ross said. “That’s why I published the book on girls to focus exactly on what’s going on with them.”</p>\n<p>Ross shared dozens of examples of his images, including one comparison between a detention cell in El Paso, Texas to one at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>“This holds the worst terrorist in the world. This holds a ten-year-old,” Ross said. “What’s the difference between the two? Who has the window? The terrorist, not the kid. I start presenting images like this to state and federal authorities . . . I start creating a bit of a buzz.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60470\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60470\" data-attachment-id=\"60470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984185\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60470\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=335%2C223\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"335\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Ross said the plan to eliminate the use of solitary confinement at the Rikers Island complex, an institution he described as “nefarious,” is a move in the right direction, but that he will believe in substantial change “when he sees it.”</p>\n<p>“For four years I’ve been trying to get into Rikers and I’ve been told by the head of detention . . . by [Mayor] Bloomberg, by [Mayor] De Blasio, by judges, ‘You’ll never get into Rikers in this lifetime,’” Ross said. “New York State and North Carolina are the two states that default and have kids automatically tried or looked at as adults. It’s a terrible system and I hope Rikers gets better.”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, while solitary confinement is an issue of national importance, it also pervades the local justice system in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The state is supposed to act as the parent when the parent can’t,” Ross said. “But these are the closets that we put kids in. They’re under the guise of administrative segregation, time-out rooms and desensitization rooms. In Santa Barbara, I interviewed a kid that was in there for three weeks.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while visiting a detention center in Monterey Park, Calif., he came to understand that the large percentage of incarcerated youths are victims of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>“I asked the director what percentage of girls had been sexually abused when they come here,” Ross said. “He said ‘What percentage? Every one of them. All 88 girls in our custody have been sexually abused’ and then he said ‘and most of the boys.’ They’re all victims of abuse.”</p>\n<p>Jessica Sparks, an assistant with the Davidson Library Outreach Department and a third-year English and Renaissance studies major, said she was shocked by the sheer number of incarcerated youth that Ross’s project has revealed have been abused.</p>\n<p>“I thought it wasn’t that many, but hearing it was all of them it brings a whole new level of depth to the pictures downstairs,” Sparks said.</p>\n<p>According to Ross, many children in the juvenile justice system are suffering the consequences of their parents’ poor decisions.</p>\n<p>“A girl that was doing 35 years — she murdered somebody,” Ross said. “She was high on meth. Her mother gave her meth when she was seven. This girl has already served about ten years . . . she was sentenced at 14 and is going to serve until she’s 34.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community. These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result. – Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ross said one director of a detention center shared with him the difficulty of protecting transgender youth within the system.</p>\n<p>“Often they are thrown out of their family and have to respond with survival — sex to eat, to sleep, to live,” Ross said. “The director said [of a male to female transgender youth] ‘If I put her in with the girls, she’ll be hurt. If I put her in with the boys, she’ll be killed. I keep her in isolation, I know it’s against federal law . . . But she is not going to be killed on my watch.’”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, African American and Latino youths are at a higher risk of being tried as adults.</p>\n<p>“Latino youth are four time more likely to receive an adult sentence for the same crime as white children,” Ross said. “African American youth are nine times more likely.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and communication double major Alexis Lin, who took an art class with Ross last Spring quarter, said it is a glaring issue that the majority of the incarcerated are of color.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of youth get stereotyped into certain categories and that’s something that needs to be acknowledged,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>Ross said he often thought of the difference between his own children’s upbringing and that of incarcerated youth while visiting detention centers.</p>\n<p>“Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community,” Ross said. “These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Hector Sanchez Castaneda said he also thought of his family when he learned about the living conditions of incarcerated youth in America.</p>\n<p>“When I saw the pictures downstairs, on the first floor of the library, when I saw the little girl — she’s my sister’s age, eight-years-old,” Sanchez-Castaneda said. “It broke my heart to see a little girl like that with no family whatsoever to support her.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60469\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60469\" data-attachment-id=\"60469\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1065%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1065,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984014\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"170\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60469\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-682x1024.jpg?resize=270%2C405\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"270\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?w=1065&amp;ssl=1 1065w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art professor and photographer Richard Ross. <i>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to Ross, communities are better off when detention centers are closed and resources are invested elsewhere in the community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been closing down a lot of these mass incarceration institutes, especially for kids,” Ross said. “We’ve turned a corner and crime hasn’t gone up . . . the data proves that the more you release kids and give resources to the community, the better the outcomes for kids and communities remain safe.”</p>\n<p>Ross said there are still significant changes that need to be made in the juvenile justice system and hopes his photos will play a part in communicating the need for reform.</p>\n<p>“What’s the common visual vocabulary: that if somebody sees a picture, you think about it,” Ross said. “I want to create that.

Clinic building to discuss public issues in I.V. with long-term residents, students and staff.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s forum featured a continuation of a discussion from <a title=\"Stakeholders Meeting Discusses I.V. Demographic Difficulties, Parking\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/\" target=\"_blank\">last week’s meeting</a> concerning parking problems and deliberation on ways to popularize arts and culture in I.V. The stakeholders meeting is one of several held weekly for the past few months concerning pending legislation in the California state assembly to turn I.V. into a community services district (CSD). A larger-scale town hall meeting will also be held at 7 p.m. on Feb. 5 at Santa Barbara Hillel to discuss potential services that would be offered by the proposed I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. homeowner Steve Fisher said there are 3,100 legal parking spaces in I.V., a significantly small amount compared to the number of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“There are 3,100 parking spaces [and] 21,000 residents,” Fisher said, “That’s one parking space per seven residents.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk, investigations concerning parking in I.V. may be conducted through collaboration with the university geography department.</p>\n<p>“Right now, I was thinking about getting in contact with the geography department, and seeing whether that was something they would even want to change,” Schunk said. “Because for all I know, they’ll say maybe, ‘We don’t care enough,’ or ‘we have other things focus on.’ It’s contingent upon whether the geography department is willing.”</p>\n<p>Art professor and long-term I.V. resident Kim Yasuda said increasing available parking space would decrease available public gathering space for arts and culture events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, what’s replaced [public space] is parking,” Yasuda said. “Parking has actually taken up all of our formal public spaces that you would have in Europe, and Mexico, such as public plazas.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda also said I.V. First Fridays at People’s Park is an example of how the availability of more space can provide a safe environment for showcasing art and gathering community members in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I.V. First Fridays is the gathering of some 400 people late night that’s safe and public and engaging,” Yasuda said. “So I’m making the case for public space access both during the day and after hours to be part of this whole arts and culture concept of Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>James Joyce, deputy district director for State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, said among other services provided in I.V. such as water, lighting and policing, discussion concerning arts and culture related services is seldom prioritized in self-governance.</p>\n<p>“When you’re looking at the arts and culture I can understand that there may be a resistance when you see it among the other options and services,” Joyce said.</p>\n<p>According to Joyce, arts and culture is an important community aspect that should not be neglected in the self-governance discussion.</p>\n<p>”When in history have artists not come in to save the day?” Joyce said. “Whenever there is a rebirth or a renaissance or something along those lines, the artists are always the first ones in. The starving artists. Why? Because they’re cheap, and because it helps rebuild things … that’s kind of my mindset.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60486\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60486\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/","id":4785,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4784,4783,4782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Distinguished Guests For Opening of Confucius Institute","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"UCSB’s Confucius Institute, an international establishment to promote the study of Chinese language, culture, history, science, politics and economics, held its opening ceremony Monday in McCune Hal...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB’s Confucius Institute, an international establishment to promote the study of Chinese language, culture, history, science, politics and economics, held its opening ceremony Monday in McCune Hall.</p>\n<p>The Confucius Institute, one of about 400 installments located around the world, will operate out of HSSB 2220 in partnership with Shandong University in China. Representatives from the university, Shandong University, the City of Santa Barbara and the Consulate General of the Peoples Republic of China in Los Angeles were all present at the ceremony. The Institute is funded by the Office of Hanban, located in Beijing, China, with UCSB matching funds.</p>\n<p>Religious Studies professor and Cultural Studies Director of the Confucius Institute Mayfair Yang said she began the process of starting the Confucius Institute in 2010.</p>\n<p>“We are very happy to see that everything is finally in place,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Yang said the Confucius Institute would aid graduate students and faculty whose research involves Chinese Studies.</p>\n<p>“Our Confucius Institute will place a special emphasis not only on language teaching, but on research,” Yang said. “We will put a lot of the Confucius Institute’s energies and funds into promoting China Studies on this campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, more than half of the university’s international students come from China, and the new Confucius Institute will facilitate interaction between Chinese and American students.</p>\n<p>“We also hope to increase the synergy between International Students Studying at UCSB and our own students who have an interest in China,” Yang said. “We will try to hold social activities and scholarly lectures where we bring these two constituencies together.”</p>\n<p>Yang said collaboration between countries like China and the United States is necessary in order to take on global issues such as climate change, terrorism and economic inequality.</p>\n<p>“We have so many global problems that no country can solve,” said Yang. “We all have to come together and deal with our differences — graciously, politely, but persistently — and at the same time try to make stronger bridges so that we can understand each other better and ultimately work together to address these global issues.”</p>\n<p>Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in Los Angeles Jian Liu said the Confucius Institute will teach students Chinese languages in order to facilitate communication between China and the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Language is a bridge connecting different countries and peoples,” Liu said. “Confucius Institute has become this for promoting the beautiful Chinese language.”</p>\n<p>Yang also spoke at the ceremony and said the Confucius Institute illustrates the university’s dedication to a global education.</p>\n<p>“Today as we watch the Confucius Institute on campus, we are creating another opportunity for UC Santa Barbara to facilitate cultural exchange, expand our commitment to global education, and extend new learning and research options to our students,” Yang said. “We feel very, very honored to be able to sign this agreement with Shandong University.”</p>\n<p>Chairman of the University Council for Shandong University Shouxin Li said the Confucius Institute on campus is distinct from others in the U.S. due to its academic collaboration with Shandong University in China.</p>\n<p>“Although there are many Confucius Institutes located around the United States, I can assure you that the University of California, Santa Barbara Confucius Institute is unique because it is established through the cooperation between UCSB and Shandong University — a University near the hometown of Confucius,” Li said.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall said he takes pride in the university’s strengths “in Chinese Language, history, living art, culture and society.”</p>\n<p>“We really hope in partnership with Hanban and our distinguished colleagues at Shandong University to build on these strengths and advance study, education and research in these areas for many years to come,” Marshall said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mayor pro tempore Gregg Hart said Santa Barbara has honored its Spanish history and is happy to see that it is now focusing on the knowledge of Chinese history.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to say that we’ve come to a place where we’re going to respect both historical traditions,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Third-year physics major Matt Share, who is in his second year of studying Chinese, said he hopes the Confucius Institute will mean more Chinese language classes will be offered at the university.</p>\n<p>“Right now, the intro Chinese language courses are offered in a one-year sequence, so if you want to take Chinese and you’re at a certain level, but you miss that course because of a course conflict, you have to wait a whole year,” said Share.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chinese international student majoring in economics Xiaoke Ma performed at the ceremony on a Hulusi, a traditional instrument of the Yunnan province in southern China. She said the Confucius Institute would give her the opportunity to share her culture the campus community.</p>\n<p>“I could let my foreign friends know what the Confucius Institute is and I could show them some of my music, like what I did today,” Ma said. “The way I speak, the way I think — it’s really different from what you guys [American students] think.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Dean of the Advanced Institute of Confucian Studies at Shandong University and editor-in-chief of China’s <em>Journal of Literature, History and Philosophy</em>, Professor Xuedian Wang said the institute is representative of “a great opportunity to make a commitment” to cultural enrichment.</p>\n<p>“I believe there is huge potential for our inter-cooperation,” Wang said, “So let’s work together.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/","id":2903,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2902,2901,2900],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The direct remainder of around $600 was allocated toward attending sporting events other than the USA Nationals in Anaheim, which they are still competing in.</p>\n<p>According to Cheer co-Captain Nick Gorton-Bufano, the team reallocated funds to the Ontario trip due to injuries sustained by team members that prevented them from attending the Atlanta competition.</p>\n<p>“We lost six people to injury and personal family matters, so we could not go, so we would like to take the money that we would have used for hotels and put it towards a competition on March 7,” said Gorton-Bufano.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60442\" style=\"width: 374px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60442\" data-attachment-id=\"60442\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-entertains-funding-requests/finance-board_will-tran-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=3475%2C2306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3475,2306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422899329\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60442\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1-1024x680.jpg?resize=364%2C241\" alt=\"Will Tran/Daily Nexus\" width=\"364\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60442\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>EAP received $250; the Cotillion Dance Club received $1,175 to fund three dancing events at the Hub; the Film Studio received $750 for catering and snacks for an event on Feb. 20 in Pollock Theater and the Iranian Graduate Student Association received $1,300 for food for their New Year’s celebration, typically held on March 21.</p>\n<p>According to a speaker for the Iranian Graduate Student Association, the club had to change their event due to the week falling on the same dates as finals week leading into spring break.</p>\n<p>“We are also offering a culture show which includes dancing and like different traditional music performances also from our culture, so that is where our other money is going.

He also introduced his program Cydia, an alternative to the Apple app store, and focused on its ability to customize devices with specific features not available in Apple’s app store.</p>\n<p>“Not everything is an app that could go in the app store in the first place … Cydia instead is about extensions and modifications,” Freeman said, “Cydia is a place where you can get custom looks for your phone, you can go and get new features … you can also make modifications inside of apps.”</p>\n<p>Third-year computer science major Andrew Dutcher said his team created a smartphone app allowing music from different playlists or tracks to start playing once you enter a designated geographical area.</p>\n<p>“You have a map on an Android phone, you make a circle, step into the circle in the real, physical world and music will play from one playlist,” Dutcher said. “Step out of the circle and music will play from another playlist. Step back in, it will play from the first playlist again.”</p>\n<p>According to Dutcher, the application his team created was inspired by video game programming.</p>\n<p>“The impetus for this problem is a 3D programmer in videogames. If you go from area A to area B, there will be a pop up and the music changes,” Dutcher said. “So you have theme music for areas. This is obviously useful to have music for different areas or for self-guided tours. Augmenting reality with geographical based theme music is really satisfying!”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60368\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60368\" data-attachment-id=\"60368\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-8.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Hacksrs presenting their hacks at the first rouhd of the exposition.

If we had more time, we’d be able to graph it and you’d see some oscillations that would reflect the rate of oxygen consumption in your blood.”</p>\n<p>West College electrical engineering major Robin Morales, one of Anderson’s teammates, and said he hopes the device can be made smaller, more portable and more practical for everyday use.</p>\n<p>“We did this so you can take it with you,” Morales said. “You don’t need to be in a hospital room or have a huge clunky device at home. … It interfaces with a computer; you can enjoy your hike and see how you did instead of constantly checking. …The components will get smaller and cheaper and then can get integrated with smart phones or even fitness watches.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the team’s project transcended winning a prize and that their creation and development of the app was what team members were most proud of.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t finished the software yet, so you know, we might win something,” Anderson said. “But we didn’t come here to win, we came here to learn something.”</p>\n<p>UCLA computer science major Dee Chen said his team created a portable paper piano that allows users a more affordable and accessible alternative to learning and playing the piano.</p>\n<p>“It’s sensing capacitants. Your body acts as a natural capacitant. So when you touch it, it sends a signal and we can measure that signal and then can play a sound off of that. It’s sort of like the touch screen on an iPhone,” Chen said. “There’s different notes, which activate from pressing your finger on the wires.”</p>\n<p>According to Chen, the piano costs less than $30 and will allow individuals who are unable to afford pianos to learn and play at an affordable price.</p>\n<p>“The second part of this is that let’s say you want some piano lessons without actually paying the price for them,” Chen said. “Well, if you press this one wire, it will send a signal to a computer to a different piano. So you could essentially teach someone how to play piano with only two of these paper pianos — you don’t need a real one.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60369\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60369\" data-attachment-id=\"60369\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-9.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Live music accompanied the hackathon as students wait and rest.

I.V. residents showed support by honking car horns, cheering on protesters and by joining the protest.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major and event attendee Kevin Villar said he relates to the evicted families because of his personal experience with a similar situation that occurred in his hometown.</p>\n<p>“This situation has a huge impact on me because my family and I got evicted during my childhood at apartments that we used to live at,” Villar said. “It makes me angry to see the reality that most landlords in I.V. only care about profit.”</p>\n<p>Villar also said the evictions may have been particularly “traumatic” for children of the evicted families who may have thereafter been exposed to inappropriate aspects of I.V. culture.</p>\n<p>“Just think of the kids and the traumatic experiences of not having a home. They deal with that fact that there will always be drunken students on the street and see drugs weekly,” Villar said. “Yet they still get evicted, which is injustice.”</p>\n<p>Former I.V. resident Maria Hernandez, who was among those evicted from the Abrego Villas, said her family prefers to live in I.V. and that the eviction has been particularly difficult because she is a single mother who provides for other family members.</p>\n<p>“It affected us so much. I live in Goleta but I would rather live in Isla Vista much more because my family prefers to be here,” Hernandez said. “I believe it is an injustice, especially because I am a single mother who supports my children and grandchildren.”</p>\n<p>Another evicted tenant from the Abrego Villas, Valentina Hernandez, said she believes it was racist of the landlord to evict her and her family.</p>\n<p>“It is discrimination because they initially said they were not going to kick us out,” Valentina Hernandez said. “I believe it is a racist act because they still do not have anyone living there, not even new students who can afford it. They said that they would reconstruct the building and slowly let us back into homes.”</p>\n<p>Valentina Hernandez said she has been living in different hotels and homes since she was evicted and said she feels like she has not been told the entire truth regarding her eviction situation by her landlord or the property management company.</p>\n<p>“I have been living in several motels since then. My daughter’s a school teacher and has also felt bad for us and housed us as well. I feel like a refugee,” Valentina Hernandez said. “I think this type of thing happens every now and then but I feel lied to and discriminated against.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60381\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60381\" data-attachment-id=\"60381\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/protesters-march-through-isla-vista-in-objection-of-evictions/ivtu-march_kenneth-song-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422629444\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"26\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60381\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C266\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60381\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Freebirds employee and I.V. resident for the past 13 years Briselda Martinez said she still does not have a permanent home and now lives in a place without a bathroom.</p>\n<p>“They did so much damage to us,” Martinez said. “I do not have a stable home still. They only gave us 60 days in the summer to find a new house. Now, I pay $750 for a really cramped up room with no bathroom whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>Martinez also said being homeless is not an option because she has family in Mexico that relies on her for financial support.</p>\n<p>“I am going to withstand everything because I cannot live in the streets,” Martinez said. “I definitely cannot go back to Mexico because there are no jobs there. I send money to my sons in Mexico and it is difficult.”</p>\n<p>Three-year resident of I.V. Jacinto Rodriguez said he joined the protest because he believes the evictions were an act of discrimination for the sake of profit.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it is racist and very wrong,” Rodriguez said, “We have nowhere else to live and it is not the same.”</p>\n<p>Rodriguez also said the evicted tenants do not deserve to be booted from their homes when they have insurance and good credit records.</p>\n<p>“This is an effort between everyone because they do not want to see my people evicted from Isla Vista.

Community Relations Committee. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) will host its first-ever Isla Vista Week from Monday through Friday to educate students and community members about I.V.’s history and issues involving I.V. environment, housing, community and more.</p>\n<p>The event series will begin Monday afternoon with an on-foot tour of I.V. led by IVCRC and will end Friday night with I.V. First Friday, an entertainment event typically held on the first Friday of each month of the academic year. Other events include an environment and sustainability presentation by A.S. Recycling on Tuesday, a family craft and community art project on Wednesday and a student housing forum hosted by the Isla Vista Housing Coalition on Thursday.</p>\n<p>IVCRC external chair and fourth-year political science major Daniela Bayon said the events are aimed at building a community that cares about prominent issues currently surrounding I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to bring students, families and community members together through a variety of different relationships, events, and programs,” Bayon said.</p>\n<p>According to Bayon, IVCRC wants to expand their community involvement beyond their annual Pardall Carnival and Chilla Vista events, which are held annually in Fall and Spring quarters respectively.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I do believe there is a housing crisis in Isla Vista. I was one of the many students who had to couch surf this past fall, and unfortunately, this is not new to Isla Vista. It has been going on for many years where students are desperate for housing, families get evicted, and rent prices skyrocket. – Alejandra Melgoza, Isla Vista Housing Coalition organizer and second-year Chicana/o studies and history of public policy major</p></blockquote>\n<p>“It became our goal as a committee to do more, and to really focus on issue-based activism,” Bayon said. “It’s really come out of this concept to bring awareness to issues in Isla Vista and address them with community members who are already working on things.”</p>\n<p>Bayon said the housing forum is the start of IVCRC’s plan to eventually create a press release to be presented to university administration with a list of demands concerning what organizers call the current housing crisis in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We want to hear from the average student at UCSB that struggles with housing,” Bayon said. “A lot of the advisers on the Chancellor’s Housing Committee don’t grasp the idea that there is a housing crisis, so our goal is to raise awareness through this forum and the stories of some of these students to UCSB administration.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, Isla Vista Housing Coalition organizer and a second-year Chicana/o studies and history of public policy major, said the alleged housing crisis in I.V. is a prevalent issue facing all students living off-campus.</p>\n<p>“I do believe there is a housing crisis in Isla Vista,” Melgoza said in an email. “I was one of the many students who had to couch surf this past fall, and unfortunately, this is not new to Isla Vista. It has been going on for many years where students are desperate for housing, families get evicted, and rent prices skyrocket.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she hopes the Thursday forum at the Pardall Center will allow students to share their personal experiences with housing in I.V. and prompt collective action toward addressing housing issues.</p>\n<p>“It will be an open dialogue in which any issues may be brought up,” Melgoza said in an email. “I hope that with our collected efforts we can find a solution to give students and families affordable housing, knowledge on their rights as tenants, and put a stop to evictions.”</p>\n<p>Second-year English major Julia Swensen, who will be attending I.V. Week, said she is confident IVCRC will succeed in improving the I.V. community through this week’s series of events.</p>\n<p>“I’ve really liked the past events that IVCRC has put on, and they’ve done a good job of educating the community about the things we don’t know about Isla Vista,” Swensen said.</p>\n<p>Bayon said that she hopes this is the first of many such events to continue the process of building community relationships in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We just really want to build the sense of community that cares about each other through these resources and networks, especially in light of what happened last spring on May 23rd, I think the community is looking for a healing project … something new we can build together to contribute to Isla Vista,” Bayon said.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly named Daniela Bayon IVCRC special events coordinator.
