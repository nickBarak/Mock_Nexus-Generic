Scholars are given a minimum of $120,000 to go towards tuition, room and board, loan fees, health and books. The program was created by Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Claudine Michel and Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Director Michael Miller after they recognized a fundamental issue with the traditional financial aid program design.</p>\n<p>Miller said a major obstacle families with financial need face is having to commit to paying for four years of education though traditional financial aid programs only provide funding one year at a time.</p>\n<p>“I can’t think of any other major purchase that works that way,” Miller said in an email. “By providing students with a four-year outlook, they are able to focus on why they are here, which is to get a world class education and entrench themselves in the UCSB community.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, UCSB stands as number three on the Top Colleges Doing the Most for Low-Income Students list by The Upshot, which measures colleges’ efforts on economic diversity.</p>\n<p>“We do a great deal for low income students at UCSB,” Miller said in an email. “Approximately 75% of undergraduates at UCSB have financial aid and we disburse about $400 million annually. For most families, a UCSB education would not be possible without some sort of financial aid.”</p>\n<p>Miller said the new Promise Scholars program is offered to dedicated students from areas of California where it is less common for high school graduates to attend UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We really were not sure how the program would be received so we made a modest number of offers and we focused on areas of the state we have not been able to recruit students to UCSB in the past,” Miller said in an email. “All of the students selected for the Promise Scholar program were highly meritorious and showed a great deal of potential.”</p>\n<p>Academic Initiatives Associate Director Mark Shishim said he is confident that this group of Promise Scholars will positively impact the UCSB community in more ways than one.</p>\n<p>“This is an extraordinary group of students – I’m confident their contributions to our University will be evident in scholarship, leadership and citizenship,” Shishim said in an email. “I’m honored to be a part of their journey and proud to welcome them to the Gaucho family.”</p>\n<p>Miller said he has very high hopes for the program and wants to see the students involved on campus without worrying about finances.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see our Promise Scholars become campus leaders, work closely with faculty, participate in research and give back to the UCSB community in some way,” Miller said in an email. “By eliminating the guessing game about whether they can afford to stay at UCSB, we are hoping to see positive results in all aspects of our students’ lives.”</p>\n<p>Miller said the program could change the way financial aid is administered across the UC.</p>\n<p>“I truly believe we are on to something with multiyear financial aid awards,” Miller said in an email. “If we remain thoughtful and continue to collaborate across our campus, I think this could revolutionize the way financial aid is administered at the University of California and beyond.”</p>\n<p>Promise Scholar Advisor Natalie Gonzalez said the promise scholars benefit from various resources and opportunities to which other students do not have access.<br>\n“One of the things they are invited to is a faculty night, and that is just for them to be able to meet other faculty members on campus,” Gonzalez said. “In the Winter Quarter will be workshops on budgeting and how to renew financial aid applications, making sure that they are meeting those deadlines as well.”</p>\n<p>Gonzalez said she wants to introduce Promise Scholars to research opportunities and other resources.</p>\n<p>“We will have more information on how to get involved in undergraduate research, how to talk to faculty members, how to seek mentorship, and overall how to be exposed to the different resources that UCSB has to offer,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez also said she hopes the program will build a support system for the scholars that will increase retention.</p>\n<p>“I hope they have peers that they can contact and connect with in order to have that home away from home support system with each other, but also with staff, faculty and other community members that are here to support them,” Gonzalez said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Associated Students Bike Committee (ASBC) and Corporal Matthew Stern from UCPD, the designated bicycle and skateboard safety officer, are largely in charge of all things bicycle related on the UCSB campus, from registration to bike path maintenance.</p>\n<p>First-year psychology major Stevi Ibonie said she bikes to and from class and has picked up on the bike traffic patterns in the three weeks she’s been on campus.<br>\n“I think that [bike paths] can be [crowded] at certain times of the day,” Ibonie said. “…people have a lot of 9 a.m.’s, so when you’re biking to your 9 a.m. class sometimes there’s a million people [on the paths] but then sometimes, when you’re biking back later in the day, like four or five, there’s not too many people and it’s kind of nice. So it kind of depends.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major Neha Nayak said she was recently involved in a bike accident on campus.</p>\n<p>“I just got into an accident yesterday,” Nayak said. “I usually bike to campus [from Isla Vista] and then walk because I don’t like how crowded [the bike paths are]. But then I was walking, and he was going really fast, and I wasn’t looking that way, and he crashed into me, and we both got really hurt.”</p>\n<p>ASBC chair and second-year economics and accounting major Tiffany Wu said ASBC updated its Facebook page to include safety information about campus biking tips. According to Wu, inexperience with biking in crowded places and incorrect bike etiquette are the biggest causes of inefficiencies and accidents.</p>\n<p>“Biking was pretty hectic in the first few weeks when there were [first years] coming in and learning how to bike and how to navigate the bike paths,” Wu said. “Mostly, I feel like there’s not really a tradition of using hand signals at UCSB. That’s why we’re trying to navigate our committee towards a more educational path.”</p>\n<p>Stern said the biking “culture” has changed compared to when he biked on campus as a student.</p>\n<p>“Biking is what I did primarily when I came here,” Stern said. “I was also a CSO so I was on bikes pretty much 40 hours a week on campus. When I went to school here, iPods weren’t popular yet — nobody could afford them — so nobody had headphones, nobody had phones and people would actually have conversations on the bike lanes.”</p>\n<p>According to Stern, there is an alternative program for students who receive citations for breaking a bike-related law to attend a bike safety class for $35 instead of paying a fine upwards of $200.</p>\n<p>“When I was in school, we didn’t have the option of taking a class; we had to pay the whole fee of the citation … It wasn’t effective in terms of educating people,” Stern said. “We’re not out there to penalize students, we just want to make the environment safer for everybody.”</p>\n<p>Stern said the bicycle registration program deters theft and is bringing UCSB’s stolen bike recovery rate to 30-33 percent, which is six times the national average.</p>\n<p>“A bike that’s unregistered that is reported to a law enforcement agency statistically has about a one percent chance of recovery,” Stern said. “Bike registration is required on campus by law, and that’s primarily why it’s so effective. If I can get 100 percent compliance, I guarantee you we’d be recovering more bikes.”</p>\n<p>According to Stern, he is planning a new committee to reduce bike theft throughout Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“It started off informally, and it grew into a bunch of concerned community members,” Stern said. “We’ve got people from law enforcement from the sheriff’s department and the city of Santa Barbara, along with some bicycle retailers and some county personnel.”</p>\n<p>Stern also said he is planning a campaign in March tentatively called “Dude, Where’s My Bike?” and plans to use GPS bait bikes set around campus posed as normal bikes, which law enforcement will use to apprehend perpetrators if the bikes are stolen.</p>\n<p>“The idea is it’s a full month campaign during bicycle safety month,” Stern said. “[We’ll] operate our GPS bait bikes… do a sweep of the entire campus and bicycle racks, recover as many stolen bicycles as we can and identify as many thieves [as we can].”</p>\n<p>Stern says the most important thing in bike safety is to be aware of your surroundings when biking and to follow the rules of the road.</p>\n<p>“If [bikers] make a conscious effort to pay attention to their surroundings and maybe take things a little slower than they normally would, then I think that would really reduce bike accidents,” Stern said. “It’s a misconception that bicycles always have the right of way … In Isla Vista, [in] more than 90 percent of bike [and] car accidents, the bicyclist is actually found at fault.”</p>\n<p>If you have any questions bicycle or skateboard related, email Corp.

She says she was motivated to retire so she could spend more time with family.</em> Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr announced Friday she will not seek a third term after December 2016.</p>\n<p>Farr has served on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors since 2009, representing Santa Ynez, Goleta and Isla Vista. While in office, Farr secured $480,000 of county funding for an I.V. Community Center and $10.3 million for the Pescadero Lofts, which provide housing and services for I.V.’s houseless population. Farr has also supported Assemblymember Das Williams’ recently signed Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which will create Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. if approved by residents.</p>\n<p>Farr said she decided to end her time in office because she is feeling “the pull of family.”</p>\n<p>“My sister passed away in the spring. She was my only sibling. She was four years younger than I was. That was a real blow and continues to be a real blow,” Farr said. “My mother — now I’m the only child she has and she’s 88 years old, and also since I’ve been in office, I’ve had two grandchildren born.”</p>\n<p>Farr said she originally ran for office in 2008 because colleagues told her she was apt for the position.</p>\n<p>“I got to thinking about it, and I thought, well, maybe I do have a unique background … I obviously didn’t know whether I’d be elected or not,” Farr said. “I’d never run for any public office before, and so that was quite an experience.”</p>\n<p>Farr said her career began when she presented a proposal to the Board of Supervisors to build sidewalks and stop signs in the then unincorporated area of Goleta. According to Farr, she then led two different neighborhood community groups, one in Goleta and one later in the Santa Ynez Valley. She then became Second District Planning Commissioner of Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“The fact that I’ve lived in the county for almost four decades now, first in the south coast and now in the Santa Ynez Valley, kind of gave me a unique background,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr says one of her “legacies to the district” will be securing funding to open the I.V. Community Center.</p>\n<p>“That’s certainly a project that is personally close to my heart, and I’m glad that we were able to keep going and secure the funding,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Williams said Farr’s support for AB 3 in her role as Chair of Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), a state-mandated agency that typically oversees the development of CSDs, was essential to the development and progress of the bill.</p>\n<p>“She came to Sacramento to testify during our first committee hearing and was able to effectively attest to the real challenges of Isla Vista in their quest for self-governance,” Williams said in an email. “Also, as chair of LAFCO during this process, Supervisor Farr has been a voice of reason, encouraging a compromise where LAFCO could be involved in the formation of the CSD while understanding why the community wouldn’t want to leave it totally in their hands.”</p>\n<p>Fifth District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino, who has worked with Farr since she assumed office, said Farr is a “consummate professional.”</p>\n<p>“She’s always extremely well-prepared, and she and I don’t agree on everything, but I’ve always respected her positions. She’s always had a very well-thought-out position, and I’m really going to miss working with her,” Lavagnino said. “I haven’t heard of anybody who’s talking about running, but it is absolutely the most difficult district in the five to represent … she’s got a very difficult job and I think she’s done extremely well.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of External Affairs Paola Dela Cruz said she has worked with Farr on a number of projects, including the recent appointment of Community Resource Deputy James McKarrell.</p>\n<p>“Doreen Farr managed to get funding for our community service deputy — [I believe] that was $114,000,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>According to Lavagnino, Farr’s work in support of AB 3 will not come to fruition without sufficient funding for a CSD.</p>\n<p>“I totally support self-governance for Isla Vista,” Lavagnino said. “The problem is if you don’t have a funding stream to handle that — I don’t think that the students understand exactly how much it costs to provide sidewalks and those kinds of things that supervisor Farr’s been working diligently on for the last years.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she appreciates that Farr has made significant contributions to I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am really proud and honored to have been able to work with her, and I think all of our community is thankful for the amount of work she’s put into Isla Vista, the amount of money that she’s been able to get for our community,” Dela Cruz said. “The last thing I’d like to say to her is just thank you, thank you for your hard work.”</p>\n<p>Farr said her career has been rewarding, but she is grateful for the opportunity she now has to spend time with her family.</p>\n<p>“When you get into your 60s and your friends are starting to retire and you just start thinking that there are other things that are important to do,” Farr said. “Being the Third District County Supervisor is absolutely an incredible job [and] opportunity — it’s an honor and a privilege every day to have been chosen by the voters to do this very important work that shapes county policy, [and] shapes land use.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 10 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65436\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/third-district-supervisor-farr-to-retire-in-december/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65436\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/third-district-supervisor-farr-to-retire-in-december/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/third-district-supervisor-farr-to-retire-in-december/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/third-district-supervisor-farr-to-retire-in-december/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/third-district-supervisor-farr-to-retire-in-december/","id":4639,"author":{"id":137,"name":"Mohan Saxena"},"related":[4638,4637,4636],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate Monday, opening an on-campus senator positon.</p>\n<p>Wright is currently studying abroad at Sotheby’s Institute of Art in London and has been participating in Senate through a proxy, second-year computer science and statistics double major Tarush Mohanti. Although she has resigned as senator, Wright plans to continue as UC Student Association Alumni Relations Officer, the Michael D. Young intern to the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and a member of the Working Group for the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault.</p>\n<p>Wright said the limits on the role she could play as senator while studying abroad contributed to her resignation.</p>\n<p>“Within my own projects, Tarush was coordinating with me so I could work on most of them remotely,” Wright said. “But I found out that I was not going to be allowed to submit legislation through him while I am abroad, essentially preventing me from doing any work while I’m away and negating all the work we had been doing, which I felt was unfair to the student body.”</p>\n<p>Wright said A.S operates as a “huge bureaucracy” whose policies inhibit with progresses.</p>\n<p>“All of its rules and regulations, instead of making it easier to facilitate work, have fostered a system of inefficiency,” Wright said.</p>\n<p>According to Wright, Senate members demonstrated patterns of behavior that “perpetuate discrimination, pre-conceived bias and downright hostility.”</p>\n<p>“Personally, I’ve consistently had my motives questioned, particularly from people who assumed I made my relationship choices based on my professional aspirations,” Wright said. “So often mental health and well-being of students is disregarded, which is horrible to see from an organization that promotes mental health reform and de-stigmatization.”</p>\n<p>Wright said A.S.’s “competitive environment” was one reason she chose to resign.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is filled with so many amazing and passionate people with the best of intentions,” Wright said. “However, in executing projects, many people — not all, but many — often can become territorial over their projects both to retain control over it but also to garner the most credit.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and political science double major and on-campus senator Nawar Nemeh said he agrees the Senate environment is one of unproductive competition.</p>\n<p>“Her resignation saddens me deeply but I understand it,” Nemeh said. “There’s a lot of cynicism about the intentions of others. I fear that this makes it harder for some people to get their reforms through.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he wants to solve the issues that drove Wright to resign by collaborating with other senators and being accessible to campus organizations.<br>\n“I am going to start reaching out to more senators I don’t usually work with and be a resource for people who need it,” Nemeh said.<br>\nWright said her “proudest accomplishments” at UCSB happened before her term as senator.</p>\n<p>“I’ve gotten UCSB Campus Regulation changed to be fairer to [sexual assault] survivors, I’ve garnered over a thousand signatures for a petition to the Regents’ requesting additional funding for consent programs and helped organize over a dozen lobby visits,” Wright said. “I found Senate a more difficult environment to complete my projects in.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/","id":3985,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[3984,3983,3982],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bake Sale Raises Funds for Syrian Refugees in Need","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Drive_Effie-Sklavenitis.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Drive_Effie-Sklavenitis.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB American Red Cross is hosting a bake sale in front the UCen Tuesday through Thursday to raise money for Syrian refugees.

Last year, UCSB American Red Cross held a bake sale to raise money for victims of the earthquake in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Internal vice president of UCSB American Red Cross and third-year biology major Allie Liu said she hopes UCSB will come out and support the Red Cross’s attempts to help Syrian refugees.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to support the Syrian refugees,” Liu said. “The American Red Cross, along with UNHCR, is providing food, shelter and anything that these people who are coming from a country in chaos may need.”</p>\n<p>President of UCSB American Red Cross and fourth-year biology major Heather Halaweh said students really like the bake sale and ask questions about the refugees overseas.</p>\n<p>“When we do the bake sale, we try to choose something that’s current, and we want something that a lot of people care about because it’s an occurrence that is happening on such a large scale,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>According to Halaweh, the American Red Cross is working to pair new refugees with other refugees who have been in the country for a while to provide an understanding of what it’s like to come from a war zone.</p>\n<p>“They help them assimilate, so I think that’s really cool,” Halaweh said.<br>\nFourth-year global studies major Arivanh Onevathana said she was excited to hear the Syrian Refugee Bake Sale was taking place.</p>\n<p>“We are always looking out for others and are very aware of what is currently happening in the world around us,” Onevathana said. “I was stoked to see the creative baked goods only being sold for a dollar because what better way to support by contributing to the cause than to enjoy delicious pastries at the same time?

UCSB has accommodated disabled students in the past through a bus service in the 1960s and a tram service in the 1990s, but both programs ended due to budgetary reasons.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator, C.O.D.E. liaison and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan had the idea for the project after suffering an injury that left her wheelchair-bound for six weeks.</p>\n<p>“Disabled students, both permanent and temporary, have been overlooked due to the misunderstanding that ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990] compliance has solved all the issues confronting disabled persons, when in fact there is much to accomplish,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Jordan said she plans to establish additional services for disabled students while in office.</p>\n<p>“I have high hopes to create a Medical Equipment Loan Closet for temporarily disabled students in addition to a new Disabled Students Study Room in the library,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major David Ashalou said he fractured bones in his left knee last year and had to walk to class on crutches.</p>\n<p>“The only problem I have with this project is that it didn’t come sooner,” said Ashaolu. “It was so hard to motivate myself to get up and go to class because every walk to school felt like a marathon.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Austin Hechler said UCSB does not have sufficient disability services.</p>\n<p>“How is a person on crutches supposed to make it from 66 or 67 DP to class at a reasonable time?” Hechler said. “Furthermore, renting equipment is really expensive and consequently leaves students with no options to get to class or around campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Hechler, A.S. is relying on funds from the parking lock-in fee to operate ATP.</p>\n<p>“It seems every time students demand services, whether it be mental health councilors, disabled person transportation or other initiatives that students demand from their institution, the University looks upon the students to fund it through lock-ins and additional student fees,” Hechler said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The social offered free food and included a talk from UCSB’s new Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn. The TSA will host socials, workshops, a mentoring program and other events throughout Transfer Awareness Month in November.</p>\n<p>Office of Student Life Associate Dean of Students and Lecturer Don Lubach said now is the “greatest” time to be a transfer student at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked with transfer students over the years, but, until the last couple of years, I haven’t seen transfer students really recognize their unique identity and get to know each faster,” Lubach said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Monica Luong said it can be difficult to establish friends as a transfer student.</p>\n<p>“Freshmen get to, like, live in dorms and they’re right next to each other, but if you’re a transfer student you might not be placed next to people your age,” Luong said, “There need to be more events just for transfer students because they feel older than everybody if they go to most social events.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Javae Valentine said housing was an issue for her when she transferred to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to find housing. I feel like it’s a common thing that UCSB fucks up your housing,” Valentine said. “They messed up my housing so I didn’t have anywhere to live at first and I was mad about that, but after that it got pretty good. I love this school.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major Travis McCahon said after he transferred he also felt frustrated at UCSB for its lack of communication between departments.</p>\n<p>“This school is awful at talking to itself, like the Financial Aid to the BARC office,” McCahon said. “I almost got kicked out of school because one said I was good and the other said I wasn’t, so that’s a bit of an issue.”</p>\n<p>TSA President and fourth-year psychology major Marilyn Garcia said transfer students have a negative stigma on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s like you’re a third-year on paper but like a freshmen,” Garcia said, “And you have one day for orientation — that’s not enough to tell you about the different resources that we have here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said building a social network among transfer students will help alleviate challenges transfer students face.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we need to help transfer students out and we can do that, not just by having leaders like me and my exec board, but also by having a community,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>According to Klawunn, the school values its transfer students because of the experience they bring from other campuses.</p>\n<p>“You get here and you start to tell us things like ‘why does UCSB do that this way?’ instead of assuming that this is how everything should be,” Klawunn said. “That kind of perspective and that kind of insight helps us to run things better.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn said transfers contribute to the campus community by taking leadership roles.<br>\n“Another thing I’ve seen is that transfer students … are really good at taking on campus leadership, so we are here to help you figure out how you want to step into that leadership,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>TSA founder and fourth-year film and media studies major December Brown said she is optimistic the transfer student experience will improve this year, largely due to the coming Transfer Student Resource Center.</p>\n<p>“That’s going to be opening up in January and we have six new undergraduate positions, two new graduate student positions, a new transfer director and two new academic advisors to work in the centre,” Brown said. “So they’re pretty much going at it full throttle.”</p>\n<p>Brown said TSA hopes to increase the number of incoming transfer students accepted to UCSB in upcoming years.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to do mentorship programs with incoming community college students during their application period,” Brown said. “We’re going to be mentoring incoming students on personal statement, helping them choose classes.”</p>\n<p>Brown said the TSA will try to provide the resources the University does not have to help increase the amount of transfer students attending UCSB every year.</p>\n<p>“I believe we’re at 24 percent transfer students right now; we want to get to 33 percent as a part of Janet Napolitano’s transfer action report,” Brown said. “She wants to have 33 percent transfer students at every UC location, so we’re going to do that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting on Wednesday, alleging emergency personnel mishandled the events leading up to Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>Hoover released the following statement regarding the events of Sunday morning:</p>\n<p>“On 10/11/2015 at approximately 4:40 a.m., SBSO Dispatch received a call for medical emergency in the 6700 block of Abrego Road for a report of a male subject bleeding from the arm and running around in the street screaming for help. SBSO Deputies, Fire, and AMR responded to assist.</p>\n<p>The victim, Andres Sanchez, suffered from a large laceration around his right arm, near the elbow.  The injury was later determined to have been caused by the victim punching his arm through a plate glass window.  Sanchez was combative and displayed symptomology of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Sanchez was restrained on a backboard and transported to Cottage Hospital Emergency Room by ambulance. Based on witness statements at the scene, Sanchez had struck the apartment window with his right arm and began running around, yelling and acting strangely.  He was bleeding profusely. Several of the witnesses attempted to restrain Sanchez and provide first aid. Sanchez’s roommate believed Sanchez may have ingested some type of synthetic drug, possibly LSD or K2.</p>\n<p>While at Cottage Hospital, Sanchez became unresponsive.  Advanced life-saving efforts were attempted, but were unsuccessful.  Sanchez was pronounced dead at approximately 6:51 a.m.  Next of kin was notified by Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital Emergency Room staff. The Sheriff’s Coroner’s Unit is conducting a death investigation to determine cause and manner of death.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said fire and medics were dispatched “within seconds” of Melgoza’s 911 call, and deputies arrived within three and a half minutes.</p>\n<p>“I was able to pull up the dispatch log and I can see exactly when the call came in and when it was given to fire and medics,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses’ claims that a translation service was not available following the incident is “totally false,” and deputies do not notify families of tragedies by phone.</p>\n<p>“Foot Patrol has many translators. We have staff and we have deputies that speak Spanish,” Plastino said. “We would never call someone on the phone … we call down to the agency that’s in charge of that area.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he wants to provide “100 percent transparency” regarding the events preceding Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>“I am so absolutely positive that we did everything absolutely right,” Plastino said. “I want everything to go to the press because I feel so confident in how we handled this.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said deputies’ demeanor on scene is often misconstrued as harsh.</p>\n<p>“At the moment of the crisis we are the ones that have to do the job, and in order to do that, you have to put up your brick wall … your mental armor to deal with the situation at hand,” Plastino said. “That can come across to some people as being uncaring, unfeeling, unemotional, unsympathetic at the moment.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said although he does not agree with Ariana, Baker, Hernandez, Melgoza and Ramirez, he thinks they are asking “good questions.”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely 100 percent glad that they are asking these questions, that they are questioning the way things are being done, because things aren’t always being done the way they should be,” Plastino said. “In this incident, I disagree with their perception of things.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses alluded to false events, causing Sanchez’s family “unwarranted grief.”</p>\n<p>“I could care less all day long if they want to question law enforcement,” Plastino said, “but when it affects the family and their grieving process for their son who’s died, then it’s an exception, because it causes them more grief.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, deputies are trained in basic first aid, but are not equipped to handle severe injuries.</p>\n<p>“The first aid kit that we carry is enough to help somebody with a stubbed toe, like a small cut,” Plastino said. “We’re trained in basic first aid, which is something anybody can go get … but it’s not advanced life support … we can apply pressure, we can do CPR.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said it is “frustrating” for deputies to be first to arrive at the scene of a medical emergency because they do not have the means to provide the care needed.</p>\n<p>“We want to assist, but we’re powerless because we don’t have the skills, the equipment or everything else that needs to be done during a major incident like that,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he agrees with the witnesses that all police vehicles should contain an emergency kit.</p>\n<p>“Here is where we need to do a better job — there was a criticism that we did not carry a first aid kit,” Platino said. “That’s gonna be addressed … Every single one of [our] cars needs to have a first aid kit.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, one of the two IVFP deputies who responded had a flashlight when approaching Sanchez, but the allegation that a deputy carried a baton is “absolutely untrue.”</p>\n<p>“One of them got out with a flashlight, and the flashlights are not very big, so I don’t know how that could have been construed as a baton. The batons are long,” Plastino said. “That flashlight was never used in any way to restrain the young man, it was never used against anybody that was a bystander. It wasn’t used at all.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he is “very impressed” with the witnesses’ response when Sanchez approached them.</p>\n<p>“There was a woman who was assisting, trying to keep him down, because he was trying to get up,” Plastino said. “Hats off to those who assisted him because with blood loss, the more worked up you are, the more blood you can lose. They were absolutely doing the best job they could as bystanders.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said the deputies’ behavior alleged in the witnesses’ accounts can “not be tolerated,” and he asks for evidence that such misconduct occurred.</p>\n<p>“Whoever is propagating that kind of nonsense, I would ask them to come forward and provide proof of it,” Plastino said. “If there is proof of it, we need to have a full-blown investigation.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, officers will meet with the Sanchez family today to ensure the two deputies did everything in their power when addressing the situation.</p>\n<p>“The sheriff is meeting actually with the family today and going to show them everything so that they can rest assured that we handled their son properly,” Plastino said, “that he was not mistreated in any way, that no part of this was mistreatment of their son.”</p>\n<p>[<em>Correction: This article previously stated San Diego deputies notified the Sanchez family of Andres Sanchez’s death; however, it was Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital that did so.

Senate meeting on Wednesday night to give witness testimonials of the events leading up to the death of second-year pre-biology major Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez on Sunday, Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:40 a.m., two Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies responded to reports of a male subject on the 6700 block of Abrego Road running in the street screaming for help. Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm.</p>\n<p>The five students, Areli Ariana, Ashley Baker, Jocelin Hernandez, Alejandra Melgoza and Marvin Ramirez, dialed 911 following an encounter with Sanchez near their residence. According to the students, first responders on the scene mishandled the situation, mistreating the victim and witnesses based on their race.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College student Marvin Ramirez said Sanchez ran up to him and Hernandez screaming “help!” while bleeding profusely from his right arm.</p>\n<p>“He, like, ran into my arms and I didn’t even have a shirt on, and I felt him and he had a massive cut in his right arm and it was just gushing out blood, and it wasn’t dripping, it was literally flying and it was ridiculous,” Ramirez said. “I knew at the time that it was a matter of time, and we ran inside and tried to get a towel and we tried to take care of him.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez was restless but was not violent toward the five witnesses.</p>\n<p>“He was a little bit out of control due to the adrenaline, so he was running around from one apartment complex to another, but we attempted to stop him. We sat him down several times,” Ramirez said. “Though it seemed like he was violent, he didn’t do anything to us.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza said she spoke with dispatch and “specifically requested” medical assistance, but was not taken seriously.</p>\n<p>“I was the one who called dispatch and dispatch didn’t believe me,” Melgoza said. “When you have anyone who is pleading for help, saying that there is blood gushing out of a wound — when you have someone who is passed out in front of your doorstep with blood gushing out of a wound, I would expect dispatch to hear the screaming in the background.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year comparative literature and psychology double-major Areli Ariana said EMTs and paramedics who responded to the call displayed a lack of urgency.</p>\n<p>“They literally acted like it was an inconvenience for them to do their job,” Ariana said. “We were yelling at them, and yes we were frantic, but who wouldn’t be if they were covered in blood.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, emergency personnel took a long time to arrive, and police officers and firefighters did not act urgently upon arriving at the scene.</p>\n<p>“I was jumping in front of them and just full of blood and telling them to hurry up and they just walked out of the car,” Ramirez said. “When the firefighters got there they didn’t want to get blood on their suit, and I remember Jocelin screaming at them, ‘If I have blood on me, why can’t you get blood on you! Hurry up, we don’t have time!’”</p>\n<p>Ariana said responders disregarded her and other witnesses’ attempts to explain the situation, but acknowledged a white male bystander who began speaking to them after police arrived.</p>\n<p>“We’re all basically persons of color; there’s no doubt that we’re brown. He just completely bypassed everything we said,” Ariana said. “He didn’t acknowledge our presence — he didn’t recognize us. From the moment we started speaking he ignored us.”</p>\n<p>According to Ariana, the deputies who responded treated Sanchez “brutally” without reason.</p>\n<p>“While Jocelin and I were huddled over Andy, we were able to hold him down and to calm him down while the police officers came,” Ariana said. “When the police officers came, the first thing they did was to grab a baton and try to hold Andy down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year film and media studies major Ashley Baker said the police officers involved in Sunday night’s incident were not held accountable for their “brutal” treatment of Sanchez.</p>\n<p>“This is the third time in my life that I have witnessed one of my Latino brothers pass away and have it be completely erased the next morning,” Baker said. “Instead of having a thorough investigation they wash everything down. It was like a Hazmat — it  was like it never happened.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the officer did not have an emergency kit and approached the scene with a baton in hand.</p>\n<p>“One of the other things was that the cop didn’t have an emergency kit, so when they got out they just got out with a baton. What good are you by then?” Ramirez said. “We asked why, and they just said the car did not have it on them. That’s not an excuse because we lost a life, and you don’t know how important that is but that’s a life, a student life.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said Sanchez’s death is likely due to first responders’ misconduct.</p>\n<p>“This is a fellow student of ours who probably died because of the negligence of the EMTs and the paramedics and the police officers,” Ariana said.</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez’s mother was unaware of the situation the next day due to an incomplete police report, in which the witnesses who called emergency services were not included.</p>\n<p>“You don’t understand how hard it was,” Ramirez said. “And how hard it was for the mother when we saw her the next day and she had no idea about what happened because they didn’t take a thorough report and they didn’t include us in the report.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said IVFP did not have translation services available, which delayed the time it took to notify Sanchez’s family of his death.</p>\n<p>“We found out that his family didn’t speak English, so they needed a translator,” Ariana said. “He [the officer] was very insensitive to that and he did not prioritize communicating the sensitive information to Andy’s family.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza also said emergency responders should have access to translation, especially to Spanish.</p>\n<p>“How many Latino/Latina families are out in Isla Vista?” Melgoza said. “The fact that we don’t have translating services is a disgrace.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said she wants to stress the “racial dynamics and dimensions” of the law enforcement’s failure to address the situation.</p>\n<p>“It looks like two cops running in and trying to restrain the individual. And they criminalized the individual because they don’t know how to react,” Hernandez said. “They recoiled at the sight of the wound because they’re not trained, that is not somebody that is trained to ensure our safety.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the police officers did not carry out their responsibility to ensure Sanchez’s well-being.</p>\n<p>“This is a student that meant nothing to us, I’m not even getting paid to care,” Ramirez said. “If we have such urgency why don’t they do everything in their power?”</p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">“IVFP Responds to Allegations of Misconduct in Sanchez’s Death.”</a></em></p>\n<p><em>For the SBC Fire response:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>The </em>Nexus<em> firmly believes in fair comment and is actively seeking comment from all agencies involved in these allegations.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus. <em>The title of this article was edited to better reflect the context in which the statements were delivered. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/","id":4640,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4639,4638,4637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student Andres Esteban Sanchez Passes Away Sunday Morning","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On the morning of Sunday, Oct. 11 at approximately 4:40 a.m., two IVFP deputies responded to reports of a male subject on the 6700 block of Abrego Road running in the street screaming for help.

SB 295 requires the State Fire Marshal to perform annual oil pipeline inspections, rather than every two years. Under SB 414, the Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) must research the best utilization of commercial fisherman and other mariners as quick responders for oil spill containment. SB 414 also requires OSPR report chemical dispersant use to the legislature and research prevention and containment of oil spills.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 684 (AB 684) implements more efficient spill-prevention technology such as automatic shutoff systems, leak detection technology and sectionalized block valves in sensitive coastal environments. According to the bill, installation of these technologies will be complete by Jan. 1, 2018, and the State Fire Marshal will have adopted the necessary regulations to effectively assess risk analysis of pipelines by July 1, 2017.</p>\n<p>Jackson said she believes more frequent pipeline inspection could have prevented the Refugio Beach Oil Spill, as many pipeline failures are largely due to damage from chemicals added to oil for faster transport.</p>\n<p>“As oil has become more viscous and more problematic, there are more corrosive chemicals being used to thin it out so it can be transported more easily, and these are having a tremendous and detrimental effect on the pipelines,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Williams said while the three bills are a “step forward” in protecting the environment from oil spill damage, oil production still poses as threat to surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>“As long as we have oil production in environmentally sensitive areas like those in Santa Barbara County, we live under threat of damaging oil spills,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-chair and third-year computer science and environmental studies double major Nicholas Frey said the bills are only temporary solutions to the greater problem of fossil fuel dependence.</p>\n<p>“While they were good, it was just kind of putting on a little Band-Aid to a much larger problem,” Frey said. “I would’ve wanted to see more transitioning out of fossil fuels and actually removing said pipelines.”</p>\n<p>UCSB CALPIRG campus organizer Alena Simon said California needs further legislation that transitions it toward alternative energy.</p>\n<p>“I think we’d like to see California go 100 percent renewable and not actually rely on these dirty fossil fuels at all,” Simon said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said California should seek renewable energy “as rapidly as possible.”</p>\n<p>“We can work to make pipelines safer, but as long as there is oil drilling there will be oil spills,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>EAB Co-chair and second-year environmental studies major Chris Berry said he hopes legislators continue to pass legislation to impose tighter controls on the fossil fuel industry prior to another oil spill, rather than in response.</p>\n<p>“It stinks for me that we have to have these spills before we can pass tougher legislature on oil and fossil fuel industries,” Berry said. “I’m glad to see them passed, and I think frequent checks will be better … because it’s never if a spill’s going to happen, it’s when, so hopefully they can be checked and prevented.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Included in the 10 points are proposals for the temporary seizure of guns from dangerous individuals and background checks on all gun sales. Schneider also presented the idea for a $10 billion national gun buyback program in her plans. The Santa Barbara Police Department (SBPD) held a gun buyback program the past two summers, allowing owners to return their guns for money, no questions asked.</p>\n<p>Schneider said as a result of the SBPD buybacks, hundreds of guns in the Santa Barbara area are now “off the streets.”</p>\n<p>“We could calculate 55 million guns off the street with this kind of [national] program,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>Schneider said gun control is a “top priority” in light of recent mass shootings, including those at Northern Arizona University and Umpqua Community College in Oregon.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately we’ve seen the very tragic events both in Isla Vista last year,” Schneider said. “Everywhere you turn, these kind of incidents happen, and as a mayor you don’t want to get that call that someone’s been shot and killed due to gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor of Chican@ studies Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, who organized a vigil to honor victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting, said he discussed the importance of gun laws with Assemblymember Das Williams in the past.</p>\n<p>“Take guns out of the hands of people that shouldn’t have them,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “If that’s gun control, then I’m all for it. Certain people should not have guns; that’s all.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said Assembly Bill 1014, a legislation similar to Schneider’s 10th point which allows law enforcement to temporarily seize guns from a person who poses immediate danger, will only be effective if Californians know they can request a dangerous person’s weapons be removed.</p>\n<p>“Having [AB 1014] on the books is helpful but a lot of people don’t know about that,” Armbruster-Sandoval said.</p>\n<p>Owner of Dodge City Shooters Supply Rick Dodge said most of Schneider’s proposals would have little effect on his gun store because California gun laws are already some of the strictest in the country.</p>\n<p>“Most of those things don’t apply to California because we already have them,” Dodge said.</p>\n<p>Dodge said while he is in favor of background checks, gun owners are prone to undeserved scrutiny.</p>\n<p>“Thirty-thousand people die in a car accident every year, so why don’t we all drive cars at 15 miles per hour with rubber tires put all the way around?” Dodge said.</p>\n<p>Schneider said attention to recent mass shootings will make gun laws a prevalent topic in the upcoming 2016 election.</p>\n<p>“I think what’s changing in the last couple of years especially is that general voters, democrats, republicans, gun owners, non-gun owners are saying enough is enough,” Schneider said. “This is going to be and should be a campaign issue in 2016.”</p>\n<p>Dodge said Schneider’s proposal may have an unexpected effect even if it fails to go into law.</p>\n<p>“When [politicians] talk about it … more people rush into the stores and are worried about more stringent regulations, it creates more sales for us,” Dodge said. “We always joke around: The best salesman in the world is President Obama — he mentions something and everyone around the nation rushes in to buy.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The car was in drive and running on Embarcadero Road headed towards Del Playa Road. Officers administered a DUI investigation and found the driver had a BAC of .01 percent, with a background check later revealing Jordan as a heroin addict. Jordan admitted to being under the influence of heroin, later confirmed through a urine sample. Deputies also located heroin paraphernalia in his vehicle. Jordan was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail and his vehicle was towed and stored with Loves Towing.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 6, two I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies were walking near Anisq’ Oyo’ Park and recognized Say’Qwaun Ford, a suspect whom they had seen in recent warrant status. He was detained for a records check and with Ford’s consent, deputies searched his backpack. A small pouch of marijuana, a small amount of cocaine and a stolen wallet with multiple items belonging to different people were found. Ford said he found the wallet on the kitchen floor of a party he attended the night before and did not know how the cocaine ended up in his bag, but anticipated his fingerprints would most likely be on it. He admitted to owning the marijuana. Ford, who had a previous history of providing a false identity and burglary, was arrested for theft and possession of illegal substances.</p>\n<p>On the night of Friday, Oct. 9, at approximately 12:46 a.m., law enforcement officers attempted to stop and detain a male suspect on suspicion of an alcohol possession violation. The suspect fled from the officers, drawing attention from other law enforcement officials in the area who ran to assist. One of the assisting officers collided with the suspect, causing him to slam into a parked car and slide to the pavement. Deputies then converged on the suspect as medical assistance made its way to the scene. Upon arrival, paramedics treated the suspect then took him to the hospital for further evaluation. The suspect fractured his left wrist and had several abrasions on his head, hands and knees. UCPD initiated a Use of Force review as a UCPD officer made contact with the suspect.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, an IVFP deputy witnessed a suspect, later identified as Dustin Anthony, strike a male victim in the head with a closed fist in the middle of Del Playa Road. The victim lost consciousness and hit his head on the concrete, causing him to seize and urinate in his pants. The victim was taken to the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital emergency room and Anthony was arrested at the scene and taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, two male students were seen in broad daylight streaking around their residence at 6549 Cervantes. According to the students, they had lost a bet and had to run around the block naked. Two UCPD officers contacted the subjects and issued them citations for public nudity. Clothes were brought to the suspects by each of their parties while tickets were being issued.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-65273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Castro Valley Business</em></p></div>\n<p>Community leaders in the unincorporated area of Castro Valley, California, have been following Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 in the interest of pursuing a model for self-governance similar to Isla Vista’s.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 proposes the formation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. While unincorporated areas such as I.V. and Castro Valley receive municipal services from their county, a CSD is governed by a board of local representatives that decide what services to provide to residents using local tax revenue.</p>\n<p>Traditionally CSD’s are formed through Local Agency Formation Commissions (LAFCO), but both unincorporated areas have found that LAFCO’s model for a CSD does not fit each area’s respective needs. AB 3 bypasses LAFCO by establishing a CSD though state-level legislation. Castro Valley Matters, a group advocating for self-governance in the northern California community, have been closely following the bill, which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law last week.</p>\n<p>According to Castro Valley Matters President Michael Kusiak, the group has followed AB 3 since Williams first introduced the bill to the Assembly in December 2014.</p>\n<p>“We’re kind of crazy people up in northern California who have been following what’s been happening down in Santa Barbara and Isla Vista,” Kusiak said.</p>\n<p>An I.V. CSD as outlined in AB 3 would be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills. Kusiak said a UUT is an “innovative means” of funding self-governance in unincorporated areas, because LAFCO often rejects CSD proposals on the basis that they are not financially feasible.</p>\n<p>“Our contention is that any unincorporated community that tries to go to LAFCO at this point will be told, ‘Actually, no, you’re not fiscally viable,’” Kusiak said. “Isla Vista is really special. It’s really interesting. That’s why we at Castro Valley Matters are following it.”</p>\n<p>Castro Valley Matters Vice President Michael Baldwin said the group is interested in a “virtual town” model, which combines a CSD, a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and an Area Planning Commission (APC). According to Baldwin, no area has attempted this model, but I.V. is “as close as it comes.”</p>\n<p>“I was advocating to have a ‘virtual town’ model, which is basically what you guys did — to have a CSD that covers the whole town,” Baldwin said. “Nobody has ever done all three together — no ‘virtual town’ model.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said the self-governance process in Castro Valley has been “a lot slower” than in I.V., and their few group meetings have led to participants “talking in circles.”</p>\n<p>“It’s the opposite of what’s going on down there,” Baldwin said. “You guys got together and figured something out and pushed it through.”</p>\n<p>Kusiak said AB 3 can serve as an example of local governance for unincorporated areas that are unable to attain cityhood.</p>\n<p>“I think it sets a precedent not just for Castro Valley but for all unincorporated communities,” Kusiak said. “I know it only applies to Isla Vista, but it tells our state legislature that unincorporated communities can be given alternatives.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said when he called William’s office after AB 3 was introduced, staffers told him not to market the bill as a model for other unincorporated areas seeking self-governance for fear it would invite opposition.</p>\n<p>“They kind of said, ‘Oh no. Don’t publish that actually. We don’t want people to think its precedent even though it kind of is,’” Baldwin said. “They were worried that if the legislature saw it as a precedent they might not pass it.”</p>\n<p>Williams said some are “scared to death” AB 3 will pave the way for other areas to circumvent LAFCO when working toward self-governance.</p>\n<p>“I will tell you that, with the opposition to AB 3, much of it was based on that it could be precedent setting,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill was specially made for I.V. and he does not intend to replace the LAFCO process throughout California.</p>\n<p>“At no time in this effort have we taken on or criticized the LAFCO process for the entire state,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said Castro Valley Matters’ support demonstrates I.V.’s role as a progressive and innovative unincorporated area.</p>\n<p>“As far as governance for an unincorporated community, it shows that our community is a very forward-thinking one,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said I.V. should support other unincorporated areas such as Castro Valley.</p>\n<p>“I think it would be important for Isla Vista to share its experience now to other communities who need that help,” Abboud said</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 only seeks approval of I.V. residents, not in the recognition of those outside the area.</p>\n<p>“The real legitimacy of the government doesn’t rest with people outside the community,” Williams said. “It rests with the people in the community making the decisions themselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65300\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65300\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/","id":4632,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4631,4630,4629],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":111,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
