The NAI is a non-profit organization with 414 fellows, collectively holding nearly 14,000 U.S. patents and representing over 150 institutions, and it serves to recognize inventors who hold U.S. Patents. Nominees must be named inventors on at least one patent issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and are chosen by their peers and then later approved by a selection committee.</p>\n<p>Nakamura said in an email that he credits the NAI honor to his invention of the energy efficient blue light emitting diode (LED) and blue laser diodes, for which he was recently also awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics. Nakmura also said his inspiration for his work comes from a deep examination of the world around him.</p>\n<p>“I like to think about anything deeply to understand the mechanism behind the scene,” Nakamura said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI President, founder and AAAS-Lemelson Invention Ambassador Paul R. Sanberg said designation as a fellow is the only high-level national honor specifically available to academic inventors.</p>\n<p>“The NAI fellows are prolific innovators whose discoveries and inventions have fostered new ideas, products and companies that benefit their institutions and communities and are making an impact on society,” Sanberg said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI Vice President George Newkome, who himself holds 45 patents and has published 450 scientific papers, said Nakamura’s fellowship will lead the way for more faculty at the university to become NAI fellows in the future.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that professor Nakamura was chosen to be a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors it is a true honor to be part of NAI and I am sure that many others from UCSB will be following in his footsteps,” Newkome said in an email.</p>\n<p>Two other faculty are also NAI fellows — Materials Professor and Co-Director of UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) Steven DenBaars and Chemical Engineering professor and Founding Director of the Center for Bioengineering Samir Mitragotri.</p>\n<p>According to DenBaars, Nakamura’s fellowship further reinforces his position as a world renown innovator and highlights the widely impactful effect he has made globally with his innvention of the LED.</p>\n<p>“As a colleague and co-director of SSLEEC I am delighted that Shuji Nakamura is a new NAI Fellow,” DenBaars said in an email. “This is a strong endorsement of Shuji inventions and patents he has filed since coming to UCSB 14 years ago. This is indicative of Shuji’s innovative research and world-leading status of UCSB’s materials department.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitragotri, Nakamura’s election to the NIA is a significant recognition of his accomplishments in physics and materials science.</p>\n<p>“In addition to celebrating innovation, NAI enables the fellow to collectively think about some of the important aspects of promoting and sustaining academic innovation,” Mitragotri said in an email. “Shuji has made some of the most significant inventions of our generation. His election to NAI recognizes his accomplishments.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/","id":2945,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2944,2943,2942],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Professor Dies Over Winter Break","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"74-year-old materials professor Edward Kramer (far right) died in his sleep at his home in Santa Barbara on the morning of Dec 27.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_59415\" style=\"width: 336px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"463889733\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59405\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59415\" data-attachment-id=\"59415\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/ucsb-professor-dies-over-winter-break/image/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\\u00a9UCSB Photographic Services\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59415\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image-683x1024.jpg?resize=326%2C490\" alt=\"Materials professor Edward Kramer died on the morning of Dec 27.

Kramer is survived by his wife, Gail, their children Jeanne and Eric his grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Kramer graduated from Cornell University in 1962 with a Bachelors in chemical engineering and earned a Ph.D. in metallurgy and materials science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1966. He joined the faculty of Cornell University in 1967 and in 1973 authored a paper that greatly expanded current knowledge on a phenomenon called flux pinning, where exceptionally conductive materials are suspended in space above a magnet. While at UCSB, Kramer worked collaboratively with various professors, post-doctoral scholars and Ph.D. candidates, particularly in the area of polymer science, in which he was considered an expert.</p>\n<p>Rod C. Alferness, Dean of the College of Engineering, said the death of Kramer was unexpected despite a recent heart surgery.</p>\n<p>“Its a huge loss,” Alferness said. “It came as a shock; I was not expecting it to happen at this time. There’s a sense of loss both for the college and the university.”</p>\n<p>Kramer’s longtime colleague, chemical engineering professor Glenn Fredrickson, said while Kramer’s heart surgery had taken place several months ago and he was in recovery, Kramer had been active in the research lab and had attended the dissertation defense of two of his Ph.D. students just a week prior to his death.</p>\n<p>“He had been very active and animated during the discussion and questioning period, so we had a sense that he was on the mend and was his old self,” Fredrickson said. “Everybody who had interacted with him just a week ago had a sense that it was all uphill from there, we were really taken aback by this.”</p>\n<p>According to Materials Dept. chair Tresa Pollock, Kramer was a devoted faculty member who took pride in the achievements of the students he mentored.</p>\n<p>“He was a very dedicated teacher and mentor,” Pollock said.“He put a tremendous amount of effort into developing his courses and teaching them carefully.”</p>\n<p>Kramer was set to teach an undergraduate course this quarter in the chemical engineering department, Introduction to Polymer Science, which Pollock said would be filled by Rachel Segalman, a former student and colleague of Kramer at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>According to Alferness, Kramer was planning to retire from his faculty position at the end of the year and would not have taken on any new graduate students or postdoctoral researchers, but would have remained with the university as a researcher.</p>\n<p>Alferness also said Kramer was a role model for younger faculty and mentioned that Kramer and his wife donated enough money to the university to establish an endowed chair position that has yet to be filled within the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>“He was a great citizen on campus as well and a strong advocate for UCSB. A very wise person. Everyone will tell you who knows him, he was truly a gentleman and served as a wonderful mentor,” Alferness said. “[Establishing an endowed chair] is not a typical thing for faculty to do; it speaks to his view of the importance of education.”</p>\n<p>Kramer also led the Kramer/Fredrickson research group within the Materials Research Laboratory. The group’s research primarily focused on studying certain properties of block copolymers, materials made up of block-like structures of multiple molecules. Specifically, the group’s recent research has centered on understanding the processes by which certain materials melt, as well as the process of directed self-assembly. According to the Institute for Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, directed self-assembly is a process by which molecules of certain materials spontaneously come together, or “self-assemble”.</p>\n<p>According to Fredrickson, a longtime collaborator of Kramer’s, Kramer was among the first to develop the field of examining directed self-assembly and did some of the early experimentation on the process and that Fredrickson used his work in a theoretical research group in materials research.</p>\n<p>“He did a lot the early pioneering work on directed self assembly … and looking at how polymers assemble themselves in confined ‘wells’ within a thin film,” Fredrickson said. “My group has subsequently developed theoretical tools for simulating polymers under confinement and much of that was simulated by experimental work [from] his group.”</p>\n<p>Fredrickson also said Kramer’s work on the directed self-assembly processes represents an advancement in the way certain products are manufactured.</p>\n<p>“Now its become [a] technology that companies like Intel and Sony viewing it as a strategy for next generation patterning of semi-conductor devices,” Fredrickson said. “Being able to make smaller features on devices than they currently can now, the strategy for making microprocessors faster is to shrink the devices and that requires patterning on smaller and smaller length scales.”</p>\n<p>According to Fredrickson, Kramer was one of the first people to work on the process in a “methodical, systematic experimental way” that has set the stage for it to become a “developing technology.”</p>\n<p>According to Nate Lynd, an assistant professor in the department of chemical engineering at University of Texas, Austin, and formerly a post-doctoral researcher under Kramer at UCSB, the late professor’s work with the group was unique given his level of involvement in the group’s work.</p>\n<p>“Ed very much liked to be involved,” Lynd said. “You would sometimes see the light on in his office in the evening he would be working on data himself which I think is somewhat rare for a professor this late in his career.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Kramer’s contributions to materials science are “legendary”.</p>\n<p>“He helped to elevate the stature of our university and our top-ranked Materials and Chemical Engineering departments, and provided exemplary leadership and service to our campus community in so many other ways as well, including co-chairing the search advisory committees for our previous and current Dean of Engineering,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Lynd also said Kramer fostered an atmosphere of collaboration in the various research efforts he took part in and various faculty members and departments would be involved in the polymer research Kramer carried out.</p>\n<p>“What was really great about Ed’s group was just how well integrated it was with the research efforts others, with the research of other faculty at UCSB,” Lynd said. “It was this incorporation of the contributions of the expertise of many people that had made a lot of this research great and Ed. This was his modus operandi, and he was a big cheerleader of carrying out collaborative research.”</p>\n<p>Lynd said Kramer aided him greatly in his postdoctoral studies and taught him to work collaboratively with others in the group.</p>\n<p>“Recognizing what kind of peg you are and finding the right hole on the team, that’s something Ed definitely helped me with,” Lynd said, “and since that time things went just great … I really owe a lot to Ed.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Kramer’s age as 74, he was actually 75. The article also incorrectly described the directed self-assembly process as spontaneous, it actually occurs in controlled environments under the influence of researchers. The article also incorrectly stated Fredrickson used Kramer’s scholarship in his own work, this is also incorrect, Fredrickson used his work in a collaborative theoretical research group composed of graduate students and other researchers. This article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/ucsb-professor-dies-over-winter-break/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/ucsb-professor-dies-over-winter-break/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/ucsb-professor-dies-over-winter-break/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/ucsb-professor-dies-over-winter-break/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/ucsb-professor-dies-over-winter-break/","id":2944,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2943,2942,2941],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Local Committee Meets Over I.V.

I have asked for meetings with a number of individual board members and I would ask for meetings with all of them,” Williams said. “But in addition to individual meetings I would think LAFCO with your staff and board members should be a part of our stakeholder process.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the formation of a CSD in I.V. would assist the Board of Supervisors in the work they are doing to improve I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would say CSD could speed up the great work that board member Farr and others on the Board of Supervisors have done to provide safety lighting in Isla Vista, which is an integral part of the sexual assault issue out in Isla Vista,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>District Six Representative on the Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees Jonathan Abboud said I.V. needs self-governance because its dense population makes it unlike other unincorporated areas.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is a very unique place with probably one of the most dense communities on this side of the Mississippi and this CSD doesn’t go through the traditional LAFCO process because it is custom-tailored for Isla Vista,” Abboud said. “There are very specific things that are different for Isla Vista that don’t apply to a general unincorporated area. We waited for 40 years. Do we need to wait for another tragedy to get things going?”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the CSD would also help address the issue of insufficient law enforcement in I.V. in relation to a recent increase in population.</p>\n<p>“The second possibility would be to address the fact that while the population of Isla Vista has risen 25 percent, the amount of boots on the ground of law forcing officers has remained … relatively constant,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Thirty-year I.V. resident Thomas Dixon spoke at the meeting and said he supported AB 3 because he does not approve of manner which I.V. is currently governed.</p>\n<p>“The whole country is aware of Isla Vista being a problem community. [Isla Vistans] should have the power to at least control some of that,” Dixon said. “If you just obstruct the community service district and don’t come up with something better you’re just kicking the can down the road. We can’t just simply live with the status quo, that simply is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the CSD could also play a role in providing structure and control in the midst of the I.V. party culture, by modeling tactics used at other public universities.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly, which had a huge public safety issue around partying in their community, addressed it by hiring some students to be the face of Public Safety to address parties that were getting out of control,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said the role of the university in the establishment of self-governance in I.V. has taken a positive turn.</p>\n<p>“The role of the university — that is the one thing that changed and I view as an opportunity,” Williams said. “I have been very critical in the past, as have many residents … and the fact is that this process, this trustee report, is a huge change on the part of the attitude of the university — a willingness to say ‘We’re a part of the problem, we’re also a part of the solution’ and an opportunity that we have not had in 40 years, and I ask that we try to seize upon that opportunity.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

<em>Photo courtesy of news.ucsb.edu</em></p></div>\n<p>Professor of Physics and Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics member Joe Polchinksi gave the annual Faculty Research Lecture Thursday night after being selected as the Faculty Research Lecturer in May, an honor that recognizes extraordinary scholarly distinction and contribution to the campus and community.</p>\n<p>Polchinski has received a number of awards for his contributions to fundamental physics, including the Physics Frontiers Prize from the Milner Foundation, which was given for his work involving quantum field theory and string theory, as well as the discovery of D-branes, structures that have been shown to provide the atomic structure of black holes. Polchinski’s lecture explored black holes and spoke of the search for a unified theory of the laws of physics along with the difficulty of connecting two main theories — quantum mechanics and general relativity.</p>\n<p>Polchinski’s research focuses especially on quantum field theory, which is the basic mathematical language of particle physics. It also focuses on string theory, a proposed unified theory of all the laws of physics in which all particles are tiny vibrating strings.</p>\n<p>“In quantum field theory, I have clarified some of the important ideas, by explaining how they follow from simple principles,” Polchinski said in an email. “In string theory, I am best known for showing that the theory could not be complete, that besides strings it requires other objects that we call branes. I also have proposed an explanation of the dark energy discovered by astronomers.”</p>\n<p>According to Polchinski, his research has been aided by his ability to comprehend both the concepts of physics and the mathematics that accompany his form of research.</p>\n<p>“Probably most of my discoveries have come by taking some interesting mathematical result in physics, and understanding what is the physical principle that explains it,” Polchinski said in an email. “I think my best tool is the ability to translate back and forth between equations and physics.”</p>\n<p>Polchinski said thought experiments with black holes have led to some surprising discoveries: black hole bits, the holographic principle and Maldacena’s duality. He also said he hopes his new thought experiments will result in greater theoretical understanding of quantum gravity.</p>\n<p>“The latest thought experiment presents new challenges, and we can hope that it will lead us to a more complete theory of quantum gravity,” Polchinski said.</p>\n<p>Polchinski’s contributions to theoretical physics include a modern formulation of renormalization theory and original work on the string landscape. Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Polchinski is exceptional both for his scientific achievements and for his ability to simplify concepts for a broader audience.</p>\n<p>“As one of the pioneers of string theory, he has demonstrated tremendous creativity and insight, not only in discovering new scientific truths, but also in communicating these complex ideas in a highly accessible and inspiring way,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Washington State University alumnae Wanda Johnsen attended Polchinski’s lecture and said she was inspired by how Polchinski reinstated the idea that there are still many things to discover and that there are no limitations to the universe.</p>\n<p>“The lecture gave some answers about the infinity of the universe,” said Johnsen. “Who knows what is the beginning, where is the end, and how all universes are expanding. It brings a new idea about the lack of limitations.”</p>\n<p>Polchinkski said that while new discoveries have been made in the field of physics, there is still much more to learn.</p>\n<p>“I hope they got the idea that there are some big questions about the nature of space and other things, that we have some new and exciting ideas about,” Polchinski said.</p>\n<p>According to Professor emeritus of mathematics Eugene Johnsen, the lecture provided any member of the audience who is interested in science a basic understanding of Polchinski’s complex research.</p>\n<p>“One of the best things I took away from tonight was some of the connections between quantum mechanics, general relativity, special relativity and all of the issues that came up within that topic: the paradoxes, the questions and the present state of affairs,” Johnsen said. “[His lecture] will motivate future scientists and future physicists to pursue this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59098\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59098\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/physics-professor-delivers-annual-faculty-research-lecture/","id":2501,"author":{"id":170,"name":"Lannhu Khuat"},"related":[2500,2499,2498],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Community Meets for Latest on Isla Vista Self-Governance","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Approximately 30 students, homeowners, administrative officials and members of local government gathered at the Isla Vista Clinic yesterday evening to discuss the future of I.V. and the options availa...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_59084\" style=\"width: 617px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59084\" data-attachment-id=\"59084\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/iv-self-governance-forum-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IV-Self-Governance-forum-by-Alex-Nagase_for-12.04.2014-2-of-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C910&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,910\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"The forum, which was held in the Isla Vista Clinic meeting room, was attended by around 30 people, who included locals, students, board members, alumni, and former AS officers.

The meeting was hosted by Santa Barbara Assemblymember Das Williams, who on Monday introduced a bill to the California State Assembly seeking to establish I.V. as a CSD through the legislature, rather than through Santa Barbara’s Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), the county entity responsible for overseeing changes to county and municipal governments.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, an elected body governing I.V. as an incorporated city could potentially alienate long-term residents who are not students.</p>\n<p>“If I could wave a magic wand, I would be for Isla Vista becoming a full-fledged municipal government with the powers and resources of a full-fledged municipal government,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>“However, I think the flaws of it is that the question of how long-term residents would effectively continue to have a political voice in a demographic where the population became a larger population of students over the years, that was never really effectively answered.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he does not currently support cityhood for I.V. because it would not be possible to provide the variety of I.V. residents with appropriate political representation.</p>\n<p>“I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not possible politically because of that basic question of, how do you balance representation to represent all of the Isla Vista community?” Williams said. “How do you represent the 7,000 … people who live here longer than four years at a time when the vast majority live here for a shorter duration?”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59083\" style=\"width: 431px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59083\" data-attachment-id=\"59083\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/iv-self-governance-forum/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IV-Self-Governance-forum-by-Alex-Nagase_for-12.04.2014-1-of-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1100&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1100\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Assemblyman Das Williams speaks in the Isla Vista self-governance forum.

You can do almost everything except land use policy.”</p>\n<p>Another potential policy that was discussed at the meeting was the implementation of a UUT — a form of tax levied on the consumption of utilities services, such as water, telephone and gas — specifically to raise revenues to fund additional services for I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Jay Freeman, an alumnus and local business owner, a utilities tax could provide the funds for better services for I.V. residents to the tune of roughly three million dollars.<br>\nFreeman said he suggests further research be conducted as to the effects a UUT would have on I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“That kind of balances the books with what we would be trying to do with a city,” Freeman said. “I’m really interested in the idea of maybe trying to construct a new financial study that instead of just looking at what we have looks at what we have combined with what we do.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr was skeptical about the logistics of implementing taxes in I.V. if it remains unincorporated as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult to carve out one part of the unincorporated area for something to apply to,” Farr said. “The Board of Supervisors could look at trying to put a UUT on the ballot but it would have to apply to county-wide in all of the unincorporated areas.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said the student body is not satisfied with the status quo regarding I.V. and would support the establishment of a stronger form of local government.</p>\n<p>“I think students are really on board with this movement,” Guthy said. “We’ve been having these conversations in summer and I think there were questions before about do we like the status quo? In the conversations I’ve just been having, speaking from a student perspective, is ‘No.’”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, students feel the current level of safety in I.V. is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>“Students feel unsafe walking just to their homes at night, you know, just walking from the library and that sense of insecurity in our own community is problematic,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>No decisions about the most suitable form of self-government were made at the meeting. However, it was stated that more roundtable meetings and public forums will be held at times and locations yet to be determined.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59080\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59080\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/","id":4800,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4799,4798,4797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Undocumented,  Unafraid","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"President Barack Obama announced an executive order on Nov. 20 to defer deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants in the United States, allowing more undocumented students to apply fo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Undocumented students express hope and skepticism in wake of Obama’s executive order</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_59046\" style=\"width: 451px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59046\" data-attachment-id=\"59046\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/undocumented-by-kenneth-song_for-12-03-2014/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song_for-12.03.2014.jpg?fit=3933%2C2450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3933,2450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1417643105\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.05\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"undocumented by kenneth song_for 12.03.2014\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song_for-12.03.2014.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song_for-12.03.2014.jpg?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59046\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song_for-12.03.2014-1024x637.jpg?resize=441%2C274\" alt=\"Third-year English major and undocumented student Adriana, whose name has been changed on condition of anonymity, said since applying to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals she no longer fears deportation.

Villanueva said the president’s executive order and DACA have provided her with opportunities that might have not otherwise been available to an undocumented student.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of people who advocated tirelessly for [Obama’s executive order] including myself and a lot of people I know,” Villanueva said. “DACA has been great for me because I can get a job now and it makes it a lot easier for me to get involved in advocating for the immigrant community.”</p>\n<p>But Villanueva said the new immigration policy still leaves her fearing for her parents, worrying whether or not they will be deported.</p>\n<p>“It won’t really change much for me because my parents won’t be safe from deportations,” Villanueva said. “They will still be vulnerable because local enforcement will still be collaborating with [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement], and the detention and deportation quotas have not changed under this new executive order.”</p>\n<p>According to Villanueva, the executive order’s inability to provide protection to the remainder of Isla Vista’s undocumented population is a reflection of the continuing inadequacy of immigration policy.</p>\n<p>“I know a lot of folks who don’t qualify for [DACA] for a lot of different reasons,” Villanueva said. “For me, that highlights how much our community is still in danger of unjust detention and deportation.”</p>\n<p>Adriana, a third-year English major and undocumented student whose name has been changed on condition of anonymity, said she would stress constantly over the possibility of being deported before she applied for DACA. Adriana said she remembers the fear she felt in one situation when she had a run-in with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) while traveling from Arizona to Los Angeles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59047\" style=\"width: 343px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59047\" data-attachment-id=\"59047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12-04-2014-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=2832%2C4256&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2832,4256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1417639606\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"19\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0769230769231\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"undocumented by kenneth song for 12.04.2014 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59047\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1-681x1024.jpg?resize=333%2C500\" alt=\"undocumented by kenneth song for 12.04.2014 1\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?resize=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 681w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Many undocumented students struggle with fear of deportation and finding work, but DACA may allow them to breathe easier — at least for the remainder of Obama’s term. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I was so scared when that happened,” Adriana said. “But luckily the immigration officer was nice. He let us go because I told him I was returning home.”<br>\nAccording to Adriana, since applying to DACA she no longer worries about being deported and is able to live her life more freely by going to school, working a job and traveling without fear.</p>\n<p>“I can come out of the shadows,” Adriana said. “I’m not afraid to travel and I’ve been traveling back and forth from Isla Vista to Los Angeles.”</p>\n<p>Oscar Zarate, a second-year economics and political science major and an undocumented student, said his status has made it difficult for him to afford college because of his limited eligibility to scholarships and financial aid.

Tuesday night in a candle-lit memorial titled “Remembering Our Fallen Gauchos and Friends.”</p>\n<p>The third annual memorial walk organized by the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, “Remembering Our Fallen Gauchos and Friends” aimed to bring attention to victims of alcohol and drug abuse-related incidents, as well as to commemorate the victims of last May’s I.V. shooting. Due to rainy weather, memorial attendees walked through I.V. streets in coats, jackets and umbrellas.</p>\n<p>Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Education and Outreach Coordinator Marjan Riazi said the event was created in order to provide an opportunity for students to support each other through common experiences of loss.</p>\n<p>“This event is for students and community members who want to come together within a community of support to grieve and process their loss and experience,” Riazi said, “especially this year, as we additionally remember victims of the Isla Vista Tragedy.”</p>\n<p>The memorial walk also aimed to address the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse in I.V., specifically seeking to warn against “synergy,” or mixing alcohol with other drugs, which Riazi said is a persistent health issue in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Synergy, which has caused a number of deaths in Isla Vista, is prevalent within our community,” Riazi said. “It’s crucial for our students to be aware of the dangers of mixing alcohol and other drugs.”</p>\n<p>Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta said the memorial walk, along with other community-building efforts in I.V. and on campus, has played a significant role in helping to mend the I.V. and campus community in wake of recent unrest and tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We have taken this opportunity to just come together to remember students and community members we have lost,” Kurta said. “This year of course is especially powerful for all of us, we wanted to open this up to the larger community.”</p>\n<p>Gauchos for Recovery peer Nina Taylor said the walk had personal significance to her, as alcohol and drug issues are something that effect an extensive number of students on campus.</p>\n<p>“The reason I’m here is not only to support my community. This also touches base with some of the things I experience weekly with students that come and see us in our recovery program,” said Taylor. “I know a lot of people struggle and have had friends or family who have struggled with alcohol and drugs and as a result have injured themselves or lost their lives.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year anthropology major Brian Lee said the walk helped spur I.V. recovery from the May 23 tragedy and other common grievances experienced by students and I.V. residents last school year.</p>\n<p>“Ever since the shooting last year, it’s been really hard to recover as a community,” Lee said, “I thought tonight was a great way to just come together in peace and reminisce.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/","id":4802,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[4801,4800,4799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.: A History — Part III","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The self-governance conversation came up again for Isla Vista when Goleta sought cityhood in 2001.

However, the resulting proposal to include I.V. and the university in the incorporation plan was voted down by the Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) in May 2001 in a 6-1 decision.</p>\n<p>The LAFCO commissioners who voted to exclude I.V. argued that the ballot for Goleta cityhood would not pass in the November 2001 election if the boundaries included I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>2001: Goleta Acquires Cityhood, Leaves I.V. to Status Quo</strong></p>\n<p>LAFCO Staff Executive Officer Bob Braitman said I.V. represented a community with a separate identity and different issues from that of Goleta.</p>\n<p>“The Goleta Valley is a complex sub-region of Santa Barbara County,” Braitman said. “It’s unified in many ways, but it’s also very fragmented, both governmentally and in community identity. Many residents of the Goleta Valley perceive I.V. as a separate area, and the I.V. community itself identifies itself as unique.”</p>\n<p>According to Braitman, I.V.’s distinct social environment distinguished it from Goleta in a way that merited its exclusion from cityhood.</p>\n<p>“We could recommend inclusion of I.V. for various reasons, but we see community identity as a strong reason to recommend that the commission exclude Isla Vista and UCSB,” Braitman said.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) Vice Chairperson Ariana Katovich said in an IVRPD meeting in April 2001 that a concern she had with the plan for inclusion was that it would dissolve the IVRPD entirely, placing I.V. affairs regularly overseen by the IVRPD Board under the control of the City of Goleta.</p>\n<p>“We have been handling affairs in I.V. since 1972,” Katovitch said. “Goleta has no right to take that away from us. Goleta does not have the experience in I.V. park services. It is impossible that Goleta would be able to provide I.V. with a service that is better than what we currently have. We provide everything we do for free.”</p>\n<p>Residents of Goleta such as Robert Conbright also voiced concern on the topic of student voters in I.V. having an influence over local politics, particularly in how money is allocated, given their temporary residence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If I.V. and UCSB are included, there are people there who will vote for things they will never have to pay for,” Conbright said. “I don’t want people who won’t be here 30 years from now to have a say in how our money is spent.”</p>\n<p>Mark Chaconas, executive assistant to former Third District Supervisor and LAFCO Commissioner Gail Marshall, said the inclusion of I.V. into the new city of Goleta would provide greater state funding for the newly incorporated city as a result of I.V.’s dense population, with a 10-year surplus of $40.13 million provided if I.V. was included and $7.05 million if it was not.</p>\n<p>“From a fiscal standpoint, the numbers are far more compelling,” Chaconas said. “The state provides subventions depending on population to new cities as a ‘jump start.’ I.V. brings a lot to the table, both financially and culturally.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD member Diane Conn said in April 2001 that the possible inclusion provided the opportunity for I.V. to acquire enhanced services needed to develop and improve the I.V. region.</p>\n<p>“Basically, we want urban services and local control,” Conn said. “The only way that I.V. will get the services it needs is to include the I.V./UCSB parcel within the boundaries of the new city. We want to work with Goleta to provide services and to support appropriate development and land use.”</p>\n<p><strong>Early 2000s: Desire For Cityhood Left Unfulfilled</strong></p>\n<p>Conn also said I.V. residents such as local business owner Jay Freeman expressed a desire to be annexed into the city as a solution for sought-after I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“[I.V. residents] wanted the benefits of actually having cityhood,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, many Goleta citizens fought against including I.V. into Goleta because of its massive voting power and its broadly liberal base. This, he said, accounted for the end decision not to annex I.V. when the city of Goleta incorporated in 2002, leaving many I.V. residents dissatisfied.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of anger about Goleta not including Isla Vista and making it like an island,” Freeman said. “In the end, Isla Vista ended up getting left alone.”</p>\n<p>Following the incorporation of Goleta in 2002 excluding I.V. from the new city’s boundaries, self-governance for I.V. mostly declined in political prominence for over a decade.</p>\n<p>However, a number of important documents were issued between 2001 and 2003 by a grand jury of Santa Barbara County that assessed I.V.’s needs. In a 2001 report by the 2001-2002 jury called “Isla Vista: Who’s In Charge” and a 2003 report called, “Isla Vista: Take Charge” the jury made recommendations for moving forward with a stronger form of government for I.V. The 2001 report included a strong recommendation to establish a CSD for I.V. It found that existing entities in I.V., including the I.V. Redevelopment District, an agency responsible for overseeing infrastructure maintenance in I.V., did not have the existing funds to properly meet I.V.’s development needs, including the development of appropriate sidewalks.</p>\n<p>Among the recommendations issued by the report included a request to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to establish an agency to “correct the numerous problems” in I.V. Despite the recommendations, the Board of Supervisors took little action on the CSD proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>2014: Violence, Unrest and Tragedy in I.V. Spark Self-Governance Discussion</strong></p>\n<p>On the evening of April 6, 2014, during the third annual Deltopia streetparty that drew thousands of non-residents from across the state to I.V., an altercation between a partygoer and a local police officer exploded into violence. 17-year-old Desmond Louis Edwards from Los Angeles struck a police officer in the head with a bag containing multiple glass bottles of alcohol, severely injuring the officer and initiating an arrest attempt by accompanying deputies.</p>\n<p>A riot ensued, pitting surrounding partygoers against police and resulting in hundreds of students and visitors teargassed and shot at with rubber bullets. Over 300 arrests and citations were issued during the event, a majority of which were given to individuals who came from outside the Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p>Following the civil unrest that occurred during last year’s Deltopia riots, A.S. held a town hall-style meeting at an I.V. business to discuss solutions to address the issues that led to the unrest. Recent graduate and then-fifth-year anthropology major Josh Plotke spoke at the meeting and encouraged attendees to pursue the formation of a CSD in I.V., stating that a lack of appropriate governmental structure helped cause the unrest.</p>\n<p>Further fervor for a stronger local government for I.V. fomented following the events of May 23, 2014, after 22-year-old Santa Barbara City College student Elliot Rodger perpetrated a killing spree on the streets of I.V., taking the lives of six students, as well as his own. A month later, an A.S. a town hall meeting was held at Santa Barbara Hillel to discuss self-governance options for I.V.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said I.V.’s primary obstacle to stronger self-governance lies in its lack of an adequate funding structure for a new government, which is itself impeded by I.V.’s small geographical size.</p>\n<p>“I think that we are making strides on infrastructure, but the key baseline issue is sustainable funding,” Farr said at the meeting.</p>\n<p><strong>Present Day: I.V. Self-Governance, Rekindled; CSD Bill Introduced in State Assembly</strong></p>\n<p>The particular self-governance movement to have gained the most traction during this period has been spearheaded by Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk and former A.S. president Jonathan Abboud, both of whom are pushing for a CSD-type special legislative district in I.V.</p>\n<p>Schunk said he hopes to learn from the mistakes of the past in order to create a viable future for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The key aspect of previous movements that I would like to avoid in this one is the ‘us versus them’ mentality,” Schunk said. “Activists felt as if they had to fight against the status quo, and that sort of aggressive tone is off-putting to the powers that be.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the practical matter of pushing forward the special legislative district differ from approaches in the past because I.V. is now different demographically and culturally.</p>\n<p>“I think this movement is inherently different from previous movements simply because Isla Vista is different,” Schunk said. “We’re looking to solve a lot of the same issues. The difference is in the approach and the eventual solution.”</p>\n<p>At follow-up I.V. self-governance town hall meeting sponsored by A.S. in October 2014, attendees at St. Mark’s University Parish were divided into various groups to discuss various possible forms of self-governance. The subjects discussed included the plausibility of turning I.V. into a CSD and thus generating funds for services through a user utilities tax, forming an I.V.-specific Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) composed of appointed or elected members, or attempting to incorporate I.V. into a city again, which would still require the approval of LAFCO as it had in the past.</p>\n<p>The October meeting concluded with a vote on the preferred form of self-governance for I.V., with a majority of attendees favoring the CSD option over incorporation or a MAC.</p>\n<p>This past Monday, Santa Barbara Assemblymember Das Williams, who presented on I.V. cityhood during October’s town hall, introduced a bill in the California State Assembly seeking to establish I.V. as a CSD by act of the legislature. This bill could minimize the role of LAFCO in the establishment process, as the body has opposed increased government options for I.V. in the past.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, further town halls and meetings with I.V. stakeholders regarding the future of self-governance will continue, with the next meeting occurring this Thursday from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. in the conference room of the I.V. Clinic at 970 Embarcadero del Mar. Williams also said that further meetings will allow his bill, AB 3, to reflect the needs of I.V. residents and allow details of the proposed CSD’s structure and function to be further fleshed out.</p>\n<p>“People should understand that there is plenty of time for further public input, and for the stakeholder process,” Williams said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58944\" style=\"width: 717px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"822115420\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58966\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58944\" data-attachment-id=\"58944\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/photo-courtesy-of-the-office-of-assemblyman-das-williams/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams.jpg?fit=6899%2C4816&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"6899,4816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"Jeff Walters\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1417437712\",\"copyright\":\"Jeff Walters\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Photo Courtesy of the Office of Assemblyman Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams.jpg?fit=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams.jpg?fit=888%2C620&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58944\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams-1024x714.jpg?resize=707%2C493\" alt=\"Assemblyman Das Williams, right, introduced AB 3 to the California State Assembly yesterday, which aims to establish Isla Vista as a community service district.

Community Council (IVCC) made several other attempts to give I.V. a more sustainable form of government in the years following.</p>\n<p><strong>1972: I.V. Creates Community Services District (CSD)</strong></p>\n<p>Other options for self-governance for I.V. also included the 1972 passage of a bill by the California legislature establishing the I.V. College Community Services District (IVCCSD). This action created a community services district (CSD), a small form of independent government that allows a given unincorporated area to tax itself to provide certain services to itself that cannot otherwise be provided by a county government.</p>\n<p>According to alumnus Josh Plotke, who acted as a research assistant to the recently released UCSB Foundation Trustees’ Advisory Committee on Isla Vista Strategies, I.V. residents pushed for a CSD in hopes of working up to later establishing a city.</p>\n<p>“They tried to create a city without calling it a city,” Plotke said. “They tried to create a law with a CSD with more extended powers than CSD law allowed.”</p>\n<p>Plotke also said the university was opposed to being included in the IVCCSD, which contributed to its ultimate failure.</p>\n<p>“The reason why it failed was the county said they [the CSD] had to include UCSB,” Plotke said. “UCSB at first acted neutral and then hired a publicist and spent $100,000 for a publicist to fight against this thing.”</p>\n<p>In 1972, Plotke said the California state legislature passed a law outlining I.V. as a special legislative district, — or a government created by the legislature to oversee a specific area — which initiated the I.V. Municipal Advisory Council (IVMAC). A municipal advisory council is a body of elected or appointed officials that convene to assess the needs of a given city or county government and recommend specific action. While a CSD can govern by controlling specific services provided to an area, a MAC serves a purely advisory role and has no actual power to provide services.</p>\n<p>Despite the formation of the CSD on paper, the IVCCSD was never implemented as it also required the approval of the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for Santa Barbara County, an independent state-mandated entity responsible for overseeing the establishment of local governments, which rejected the proposal.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58943\" style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-II-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1694545327\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58941\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58943\" data-attachment-id=\"58943\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/i-v-a-history-part-ii/iv-self-governance-feature-ii-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-II-2.jpg?fit=1200%2C647&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,647\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D3&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IVCC members seemed to be enjoying themselves at last Monday night's meeting.

The plan would incorporate all three areas as portions of the city of Santa Barbara and greatly expand its municipal borders. The university came out in support of the annexation plan, with then-chancellor Vernon Cheadle stating it would provide “the lowest long term tax rates for the greatest number of citizens.”</p>\n<p>The annexation plan was put to an election in March of 1975 that required a majority of voters in both the Goleta Valley area and the City of Santa Barbara to approve the plan. Despite university support for the measure, overwhelming majorities of both I.V. and Santa Barbara residents voted against it and the measure failed.</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident Carmen Lodise’s book <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em>, after I.V.’s failure of annexation to Santa Barbara, the IVCC called for a new advisory election, or plebiscite, to determine the best option for a local government for I.V. Options presented were incorporation of I.V. into a city, incorporation of I.V. with Goleta or maintenance of the status quo. The election, held on May 27, 1975, resulted in an overwhelming majority of support for the independent incorporation of I.V as a city, which at the time had its proposed boundaries include Storke Road, Hollister Avenue and the Venoco Corporation’s Platform Holly oil rig.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em>, the UC Board of Regents was split in its opinion on cityhood for I.V., with at least five regents supporting the proposal. The university, Lodise writes, was opposed to cityhood.</p>\n<p>Following the results of the May, 1975 plebiscite, IVCC made another submission for independent cityhood to LAFCO in 1975 backed with support from the university, which LAFCO rejected again in February of 1976 on a 4-1 vote, citing concerns over the financial feasibility of an incorporated I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons Behind Failure of I.V. Cityhood</strong></p>\n<p>Lodise said he blames the political motivations of the LAFCO members for not approving I.V. cityhood, as the four no votes all came from Republicans on LAFCO, while the only yes came from a Democrat.</p>\n<p>“The wrap was that I.V. was not financially feasible,” Lodise said. “In reality, it was Republicans [on LAFCO] defeating the town because [I.V.] was overwhelmingly Democratic.”</p>\n<p>Plotke said LAFCO could not approve those proposals because various fiscal analyses have found I.V. cityhood to be unrealistic.</p>\n<p>“I.V. is a big financial drain. It’s a small tax space with a dense population that means increased expenses,” Plotke said. “It would be illegal for LAFCO to approve a city.”</p>\n<p>Lodise’s <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em> stated that concerns over financial feasibility of I.V. as a city were misguided but important for the Republicans on LAFCO. Lodise wrote that LAFCO was commonly thought to produce numbers on the expenditures a proposed city would make, when in practice such figures are typically determined by the city’s first city council.</p>\n<p>Lodise also stated LAFCO had no authority to use financial feasibility as a criteria in determining the viability of incorporation for a given area.</p>\n<p><strong>I.V. Self-Governance Burns Out</strong></p>\n<p>For the next few years the only governmental entities existing in I.V. were those related to IVCC and the I.V. Parks and Recreation District (IVRPD). The IVRPD oversaw the growth of new parks in I.V. beginning in 1975, adding 14 new parks to a list that originally included Anisq’Oyo Park on Embarcadero Del Mar, “Dogshit” Park along Del Playa Drive and Children’s Park on Picasso Rd.</p>\n<p>Despite this growth, little in the way of additional self-governance campaigns materialized in the years between 1975 and 1982.</p>\n<p>According to Lodise’s <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History,</em> years of tension between the residents of I.V. and Goleta over representation on the Goleta Water Board, which provided water services to both unincorporated areas, contributed to renewed fervor for cityhood for I.V.</p>\n<p>The 1982 IVCC election saw a slate of candidates elected who supported independent cityhood for I.V. and opposed an incorporation plan that included Goleta, which was supported by IVCC executive director John Buttny, who promptly resigned after the election. Also in 1982, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors refused to contribute its portion of funds to the IVCC, a loss of about $10,000. Shortly thereafter, the university, also a key provider of funds to IVCC, also discontinued its funding of the council, an amount of about $9,000, according to Lodise. Funding for the council by the Board of Regents also ended entirely in 1982 after a steady decline from its peak in 1971.</p>\n<p>Despite the funding cuts, the IVCC pressed on with a cityhood proposal, filing it with LAFCO in 1984 which was again rejected in a 4-1 vote. The council lasted for several more years, but without funding went defunct in 1987.</p>\n<p>According to Plotke, after the IVCC and IVMAC lost funding, prompting residents to push for a CSD to try and recover some form of self-governance for the I.V. However, he said, proponents realized that funding for a CSD could not be started until long after the IVCC and IVMAC disappeared, which effectively ended the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“They found that there was going to be a gap in funding from the time the funding [for IVCC and IVMAC] was cut off to a time a CSD could be established,” Plotke said.</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident, local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman, self-governance talks went on hiatus for over a decade after the defeat of IVCC and IVMAC. He said the group of activists who had helped initiate all the prior movements had lost energy.</p>\n<p>“I think they burned out,” Freeman said. “When they burned out, there was no one there to make this happen in the same way that they did.”</p>\n<p>Self-governance options for I.V. did not become a prominent part of local politics again for over another decade, when Goleta moved to incorporate in 2001.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CHECK OUT THE <em>DAILY NEXUS</em> WEBSITE TOMORROW FOR PART THREE OF THE SERIES: 2000s — present</strong></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to LAFCO as a state controlled agency.

The bill was authored by Williams, who grew up in I.V., an unincorporated area with 20,000 residents situated on less than one square mile.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill would be building off previously passed legislation that established I.V. as a CSD over 30 years ago and would provide more specificity as to the structure and operation of I.V. as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“We would have to spell it out more than that previous legislation did,” Williams said. “I think that it is in the interests of the people of Isla Vista … as well as the state of California … that provides balance.”</p>\n<p>In 1972, when the legislature authorized the establishment of the Isla Vista College Community Services District (IVCCSD), the resulting proposal establishing I.V. as a CSD went before the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which did not approve the authorization.</p>\n<p>Williams said having the legislature act to establish a CSD would provide more flexibility than the LAFCO process.</p>\n<p>“State legislation, unlike the LAFCO process, provides great latitude in spelling out the specific powers of the community services district,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said that if the bill passes, and is approved by the Senate and Governor Jerry Brown, a CSD could be established in I.V. with minimal input from LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“We could include some participation from LAFCO in the process,” Williams said. “However LAFCO is bound to only … approve or disprove a five member board that are all directly elected.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams’ office, the CSD would have the power to facilitate infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security and roads. The bill, however, does not specify how these community services will be funded, although Williams’ office has stated CSDs are commonly funded by revenue bonds or special taxes.</p>\n<p>Williams said the specifics of the CSD’s revenue will be determined through continued community dialogue.</p>\n<p>“There are many ideas for revenue, some are less controversial than others, and that is why we really need a stakeholder process to really talk about what is the right revenue sources for a community services district,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said he thinks a CSD will be more successful than previous attempts at self-governance.</p>\n<p>“We as a community can make that change but we shouldn’t be so naive as to think that we can do it . . . with what we have because what we have had before is not working,” Williams said. “When we had a municipal advisory committee before it did not work. Governance by the county alone, without the resources to do things particularly for I.V., has not worked.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the university supporting the creation of self-governance in I.V. is a positive sign and a key difference to note when comparing previous attempts at self-governance for I.V.</p>\n<p>“One thing that is really important that has changed since the previous attempts at local governance in I.V. is that the university, which was once an impediment to local governance in Isla Vista., is as an institution now arguing for local governance,” Williams said. “That is a change that everyone should have some hope in and it means that the aspirations of Isla Vista as a community may be able to be reached.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the establishment of some form of local governance must address the needs of the variety of residents in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Any local governance should provide a balance between the different residents of Isla Vista.,” Williams said. “Both what you could call the lower income ethnic communities of Isla Vista, the student population and the resident population concentrated out of the west end — there needs to be a balance between the interests of all of those parties.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, he and his staff will be asking for public comments from I.V. residents over the next two months to determine the specifics of the bill and said it is his “intention to continue the community dialogue that has already been taking place.”</p>\n<p>“We will be asking for input as to what powers will be included in this community services district and how many seats there are, what their terms are, that sort of thing,” Williams said. “The legislation … would continue how it is with the added detail that can only happen after we receive more comprehensive and more specific public comment.”</p>\n<p>Williams said that given the events that have occurred in I.V. in the last year, the time to act is now.</p>\n<p>“There is plenty of time for further public input and for the stakeholder process,” Williams said. “But that given, the amount of human pain that has been experienced in Isla Vista in the last year, I felt that action was necessary and that we needed to begin this process and begin it now.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58946\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58946\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/","id":4799,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[4798,4797,4796],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Womyn’s Commission appealed to reallocate over $5,000 in funds previously set aside for travel. Several funding measures were also passed, including Off-Campus Senators’ request to receive $100 for fliers and food for a forum this Friday as well as the Black Student Union’s request for $250 for the Black Coalition Conference’s registration fees and $1,035 for hotel costs for a group of 60 people.</p>\n<p>A member of the Excursion Club asked for a reallocation of funds, as the club wanted to put the $950 received last week to instead pay $100 each for the bands Sun Daes and Yancellor Chang as well as $750 for their equipment.</p>\n<p>“Once we realized what funding we would be getting from the Board we talked to the bands and they all need equipment, but we didn’t get any funding for equipment,” the Excursion Club member said. “It is pretty vital to our event because we really need the lighting to make it a safe event and the generators power the lights.”</p>\n<p>The Japanese Language Cafe asked for $420 for three events which are open to the public: a $100 karaoke potluck on Dec. 4 in the Multicultural Center Lounge, a $160 Winter BBQ at Goleta Beach on Jan 16 and a $160 Spring BBQ at Goleta Beach on April 11.</p>\n<p>Japanese Language Cafe President Eric Lee said the karaoke potluck would be a great final event for students graduating or returning home.</p>\n<p>“We think that it’s a great chance for everyone to get together and exchange cultures and many times at the end of the quarter some people are graduating or going back to Japan,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Finance and Business Committee Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said the committee was unable to fund the event, as the club has already been funded for an off-campus event for the quarter.</p>\n<p>“We can’t fund you at all for your Goleta Beach events because you have used your one time exception for an off-campus event,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>Lee said the club would then only request $100 for the potluck this Thursday, but the committee said they would not fund the club’s potluck and suggested the club try to find place on campus for their other two events.</p>\n<p>Theus said the students should relocate the event in order to receive funding.</p>\n<p>“If you had it here on campus we could fund you for those two events,” Theus said, “so you can come back again because we can’t fund you for the rest of this quarter. Change from Goleta Beach to on campus.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of the A.S. Womyn’s Commission Danielle Maldonado requested successfully that the committee approve the transfer of their $5,740 travel budget to special projects.</p>\n<p>“It has always been there, but we haven’t ever used any of it yet and I’m still leaving money in there in case it ever is needed,” Maldonado said. “The only conference that we’ve considered going to is UC Berkeley’s Empowering Women of Color, and it is during our finals week, so that’s really the only conference we wanted to go to. We have been looking this year but we haven’t found any.”</p>\n<p>Co-Presidents of the Art Club Janice Agustin and Lucy Maybank asked for $700 for the Honors’ Art Show this upcoming Spring and $1,050 for the Undergraduate Art Show in June 2015, stating they had not received funding from the university Art Department.</p>\n<p>Senator Esteni Dominguez explained the budget breakdown for the Art Club’s request to other Senators.</p>\n<p>“They are just asking for food, music and materials to put up and put down artwork,” Dominguez said, “The only reason why the second event is more is because they’re expecting double the amount of people coming for the second show.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to the book, a movement to give I.V. a stronger form of government manifested after several civil disturbances in the ‘69-‘70 academic year, which culminated in the infamous 1970 I.V. Bank of America burning and the deployment of National Guard troops to the area by then California Governor Ronald Reagan.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Several months after the bank burning, during a second civil unrest in April 1970, 21-year-old student Kevin Moran was shot and killed by police while trying to put out a fire on the steps of the rebuilt Bank of America building. After previously attributing the death to a sniper, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department admitted several days later that the killing of Moran was from an accidental discharge from a Santa Barbara Police officer’s rifle.</span> </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Following the bank burning, in April 1970 the Board of Regents established a seven person committee to determine the role of UC Santa Barbara in governing I.V. The commission issued a report in October of the same year that became popularly known as the Trow Report, after committee member Martin Trow, a UC Berkeley sociologist. The report contained seven recommendations for university involvement in I.V., among them directing UCSB to adopt policies recognizing I.V. as integral to student life, giving the campus vice chancellor authority over university services in I.V. and building university owned apartments for students in I.V. The report also said the university should act to encourage greater collaboration with the County in governing I.V. and that the size of the student population be limited to 1970 levels.</span></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58904\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58904\" data-attachment-id=\"58904\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-01/i-v-a-history-part-i/iv-self-governance-feature-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-11.jpg?fit=1565%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1565,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D3&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Between 2,000 and 3,000 students crowd the administration building during the second pro-Allen rally in as many days on Jan. 30, 1970.

Community Council (IVCC) was formed and officially recognized by the Board of Supervisors and the Board of Regents, both of which provided funding to the body, which took it upon itself to provide an open forum to allow Isla Vistans to democratically address issues faced by the area. According to Lodise’s book, the council would decide by consensus on actions they believed would serve I.V. and would then present them to various government entities, such as the university and the County. The council, made up of 11 representatives, split I.V. into eight precincts and gave each one a vote.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Among IVCC’s earliest actions included the establishment of various I.V. groups and partnerships between the university and the County. Among these included the establishment of bus passes for students with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District, — a practice that continues today — the design and construction of Anisq’Oyo Park, and the establishment of I.V.’s only currently remaining governmental authority, the IVRPD. Various offshoots and commissions were established by the IVCC and included a police commission, a planning commission and an animal control commission. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Isla Vista’s Attempt at Cityhood Shutdown </b></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Lodise, cityhood was first on the minds of many residents following the 1970 Bank of America burning.</span></span></p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It was not unreasonable to incorporate all the area into a city,” Lodise said. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In </span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><i>A Citizen’s History</i></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">, Lodise states over 80 percent of the I.V. electorate favored cityhood in an advisory election in 1972. Among the most significant actions taken by the IVCC however was the commission’s role in pushing for cityhood for I.V. and in submitting a proposal for cityhood in September 1973 to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), a county entity responsible for overseeing the establishment of local governmental agencies. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In November of 1973, the Board of Regents, then-UC President Charles Hitch and university administration came out in opposition of including the campus in an incorporated I.V.

Committee met yesterday evening at the State Street Room in the UCen to hear requests from 18 student organizations for funding.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, the committee decided to fully fund 12 organizations, did not fund one request, tabled two requests and partially funded three requests. Discussion items included the introduction and approval of a new process for distributing honoraria, or monetary compensation, for Program Board officers. Other discussion items included honoraria bill for the Commission on Disability Equality (CODE) that was tabled indefinitely for consideration by the honoraria committee, and a bill to further availability and access of information in A.S. elections code, which was passed.</p>\n<p>Requests granted by the committee included $450 to the University Affairs Committee for honoraria for three student members, $250 for the External Affairs Committee, $75 for the On Campus Senator’s event focused on healthy, productive study foods from the Isla Vista Co-op, $10,550 for the Black Graduates group, $3,840 for La Famille de Colores for tickets and flights for an upcoming conference, $4,000 for the Impact Movement’s national conference in Chicago, $147 for Vocal Motion a cappella group’s fall concert, $80 for Delta Sigma Zeta’s scantrons and bluebooks for a group study session, $400 for the Catalyst Literary Art Magazine third issue launch party, specifically for publicity purposes, to provide propane to keep their upcoming event area warm as well as to provide sculpture transportation.</p>\n<p>The Asian American Christian group EPIC requested and was approved to receive $3,000 for an annual conference held in Orange County at the Doubletree Hotel.<br>\nOfficer for EPIC and fourth-year student Esther Euseon said they needed funding because of their particularly large group this year.</p>\n<p>“We are actually, this year, the largest Christian Asian-American organization on campus,” Euseon said. “We love it when anybody comes to our events.”</p>\n<p>Finance and Business Committee member and second-year history of public policy major Izeah Garcia said EPIC is very inclusive as a Christian organization, unlike other religious groups on campus.</p>\n<p>“”I’ve been to Epic and I’m not Protestant or Christian, in that sense I am Catholic, and honestly they’re pretty chill,” Garcia said. “When organizations say ‘Oh yeah we’re very inclusive,’ it’s hard for people to think they can get into those spaces, but I think with specifically religious organizations they try to make it so they’re as inclusiveness possible.”</p>\n<p>The Art Club requested money for two different events, totaling $1,750, but both were tabled. Representatives from the club will attempt to get money from the Art Department before re-requesting from the Finance Board.</p>\n<p>The Cheer Team also received funding for registration as well as lodging for the USA Nationals competition in Anaheim and a separate competition in Atlanta. The delegated amount was $2,750 out of the $16,780 the team had requested for transportation for future cheer competitions.</p>\n<p>One of Cheer Team’s captains and third-year film and media studies major Nick Gorton-Bufano said this is the first time since 2003 that the team has had both females and males.</p>\n<p>“This is the first year that we’ve been coed since 2003, so that’s cool,” Gorton-Bufano said. “And we gained a lot of support at basketball games from people because we’re co-ed. So we are trying to grow the co-ed aspect as well.”</p>\n<p>Model United Nations also requested $7,332 for extra transportation and housing for their annual Berkeley conference, and received $1,426 to pay for registration fees.</p>\n<p>UCen UStudy, a service that keeps the UCen open for longer than average hours during finals week, received $700 of the $1,085 they asked for to pay for building management to keep Corwin Pavilion open from 1 a.m. – 6 a.m. and to pay for a massage therapist. The Excursion Club received $950 of the $2,750 they requested for I.V. First Fridays, a new events series made to draw people away from Del Playa Drive and the house party scene to provide a large scale source of entertainment in through a variety of activities in I.V., held on the first Friday of every month.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A prior version of this article incorrectly quoted Izeah Garcia as saying ““I’ve been to EPIC and I’m not Protestant or Catholic and honestly they’re pretty chill.” Garcia actually said “I’ve been to Epic and I’m not Protestant or Christian in that sense I am Catholic.” The article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Throughout this past week’s It’s On Us Week of Action campaign, students signed pledges and wore buttons to demonstrate their support. <br><em>Photo courtesy of UCSB CARE Twitter account @ucsbcare </em></p></div>\n<p>Campus Advocacy for Resources and Education (CARE) led a rally Friday as part of the national It’s On Us initiative, a campaign led by President Barack Obama’s administration to prevent sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>The rally marked the end of the It’s On Us Week of Action, which ended this past Friday, during which students signed pledges and wore buttons to demonstrate their support for the campaign. Student a-cappella group InterVals opened the rally with a performance, followed by speeches by CARE staff members Hannah Brown and Emily Potter on the social complexities of sexual violence and how the university can take action to prevent sexual abuse. They were joined by co-chair of Take Back the Night Gema Hernandez, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming and California Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson staff member Liora Goodman.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Hannah Brown, a CARE staff member and one of the main organizers of the event, said she wants the campaign to inform students about what CARE can do for those who have been sexually assaulted or for those who know someone who has been a victim of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“Our main message for survivors is that we want to create an environment that’s accepting and not shameful,” Brown said. “We want survivors to know that they aren’t alone and we are here to support them. As for people who aren’t survivors – if you see something we hope you will step in and protect your friends and people you see on the street.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year sociology major and event organizer Emily Potter, the university officially registered with the It’s On Us campaign last month and said while the CARE program has been addressing college sexual assault for years, the issue itself is getting more substantial attention nationally.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been trying to raise awareness of the issues surrounding sexual assault for years and I think it’s finally, nationally, getting the attention it deserves,” Potter said. “Nothing groundbreaking, but it’s picking up.”</p>\n<p>Potter said people have a difficult time believing victims of sexual assault, which leaves victims feeling insecure and unsupported.</p>\n<p>“I was raped when I was 15,” Potter said. “The first person I told said to me ‘Don’t even pull that shit on me when you admit that you had sex.’ That was when the seed of doubt was planted in me.”</p>\n<p>Brown said she believes the event was a success considering the large participation CARE saw throughout the week.</p>\n<p>“I think people are standing up and saying ‘Hey, this is something I really want to support,’” Brown said. “Especially because we’ve been doing our pledge drive this week and tons of people – hundreds of people – have come in and signed our pledge. It’s really great to see the support from all the students once they’ve seen what the issue is.”</p>\n<p>According to Potter, who opened her speech with the It’s On Us pledge, the campaign is important in light of the lack of support society gives survivors.</p>\n<p>“I pledge to create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported,” Potter said. “Currently we do not have that environment. For some reason, we seem to find it easier to believe the perpetrator over the survivor.”</p>\n<p>Second-year film major Timmy Linetsky attended the It’s On Us rally and said he was proud of the speakers and campaign organizers for sharing their stories and advice.</p>\n<p>“I thought some of the stories people shared were really brave,” Linetsky said. “My best friend gave a speech today and I thought that was incredible.”</p>\n<p><em>[<strong>CORRECTION</strong>: A previous version of this article switched Emily Potter and Hannah Brown’s quotes, attributing Brown’s quotes to Potter’s and Potter’s quotes to Brown.
