Senate website by the end of week three of Winter Quarter. The resolution also directs the Senate to send out a University Announcement to the student body “to inform constituents about the website and how they can get in contact with senators.”</p>\n<p>Neither have been completed as of the beginning of week five. The resolution was passed during the Jan. 9 Senate meeting in week one.</p>\n<p>Ornelas said that updating the website was more complicated than he had originally imagined. He has been working with A.S. Web Developer JudyAnn Dutcher to make the necessary updates.</p>\n<p>“It’s just so complicated and not really user-friendly,” Ornelas said. “Honestly, it could happen by the end of this week, just to kind of make it like the [Finance and Business] visual builder, where I can just go in and edit stuff.”</p>\n<p>Ornelas also said he would try to get the University Announcement sent out by the end of the week.</p>\n<p>Senators Ricardo Uribe, Sydney Karmes-Wainer, Zion Solomon, Dallin Mello, Rafael Cornejo, Melissa Perez, Jalia Carlton-Carew, Xochitl Briseno, Ashley Ng, Alexis Bettencourt, Anthony Hernandez, Yara Khamis, Alli Adam, Jasmine Palmerin and Ornelas all created their pages by the end of week two, the deadline stated in the resolution.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 4, when the Nexus reached out to Senators Nima Bencohen, Adam Chohan, Yasamin Salari, Alex Funk and Andrew Nguyen, they had not created their public Facebook pages.</p>\n<p>Bencohen’s Facebook page went public less than an hour after the Nexus reached out. He thanked the Nexus reporter for “honestly reminding” him to make the page.</p>\n<p>“I was asking for assistance from one of my friends with making some of the graphics for the page and he has not been responding to me so this will do for now,” Bencohen added.</p>\n<p>Chohan said in an email to the Nexus that he had not made the page before the Nexus emailed him.</p>\n<p>“I had been posting my Senate information on my Facebook. My office hours were still public, just not on a page,” Chohan added. “Thank you for the reminder.”</p>\n<p>Salari said in an email that the making the public Facebook page “completely slipped [her] mind once school became harder after week 2.”</p>\n<p>“However my facebook page is now up and running for my constituents to use to reach out to me,” Salari said in an email.</p>\n<p>“With that being said I do think that the honoraria of all the senators that forgot to make their facebook pages should be docked since the original due date for the pages was week 2.”</p>\n<p>Ornelas said in an interview with the Nexus that he would recommend to Internal Vice President Steven Ho that senators who failed to make their pages by the deadline should have their honoraria docked. He estimated that the punishment should be $10 per week late, although he said it would be up to the honoraria committee’s discretion.</p>\n<p>Nguyen said that his page was created late due to personal issues, however he added that those issues are “an explanation, not an excuse.”</p>\n<p>Funk could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>Senators Lea Toubian, Carla Cernat and Gabriella Shofet created their pages on Jan. 22, and Senator Yash Nagpal made his on Jan. 23.</p>\n<p>Shofet said in an email to the Nexus that since she was sworn in during week two, she gave herself additional time to fulfill the requirements of the resolution.</p>\n<p>Toubian said in an email that she did make her page by the deadline, but later deleted it due to not having a headshot. Toubian cleared it with Ornelas first.</p>\n<p>Cernat attributed her tardiness to the “tumultuous” nature of the first two weeks, but takes “full responsibility” for creating the page late.</p>\n<p>“As I’m sure many students can relate, the first two weeks of any quarter can be an exceptionally busy and difficult time as we try to crash classes, finalize our class and work schedules, get back into a normal routine and prioritize our mental health,” Cernat said in an email.</p>\n<p>Cernat is “not sure” how honoraria would be docked or what amount should be docked for senators who did not abide by the resolution deadline.</p>\n<p>“If senators’ honoraria was to be docked for creating a public Facebook page late, I would then also expect the executive officers, who receive a guaranteed $3,000 in honoraria, to receive a similar amount of scrutiny and oversight for completing all of their required duties, trainings and obligations as senators do,” Cernat added.</p>\n<p>Nagpal said in an email that he did create his page by the week two deadline, but the page “did not go live to the public for a few days” because Facebook required him to complete the entire page, “including profile picture, cover photo, and initial posts” before Facebook “publicized the page.”</p>\n<p>He added that he has discussed honoraria being docked with other senators and Ho and he told them that he should receive a dock in honoraria “in order to be fair to the senators and student body.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also states that it will be followed by a bill to update A.S. Legal Code to require future Senates to create Facebook pages. Ornelas also plans to implement more structure for how often the pages should be updated and with what.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just interesting to look at maybe who’s updating what Facebook pages ‘cause I know that some just posted their office hours and they haven’t really done other things, but there’s senators that are really utilizing it to post direct resolutions that they’ve passed and kind of just giving updates,” Ornelas said.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think that some senators kind of just made [the Facebook page] to follow the [resolution],” he added. “Either because they don’t want to [update it] or they don’t think about it or because they don’t have anything to update it with.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor and Simren Verma is the university news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.

In order to actually hold an executive office, the candidate must also fulfill the same requirements.</li>\n<li>An executive office must be declared vacant during a Senate meeting if there is the removal, disqualification or resignation of an officer. The “disqualification” portion is an addition to the previous version of legal code.</li>\n<li>Candidates can now use a preferred name when running. They have the option to either use their legal name or the name as it appears on student records for the ballot.</li>\n<li>Candidates are no longer required to attend the mixer/event/retreat that is typically held following the declaration of candidacy meeting.</li>\n<li>Any candidates involved in violations that “may have led” to party disqualification will be disqualified, while the remaining candidates will run as independents. Previously, all candidates who were running with a disqualified party would be prohibited from running in the year of the party’s disqualification.</li>\n<li>Submission for declaration of candidacy forms for the Spring Quarter general election will begin on the Wednesday of week seven of Winter Quarter, and will continue until Wednesday of the ninth week of Winter Quarter.</li>\n<li>Active campaigning is prohibited until Tuesday of week three of Spring Quarter at 8 p.m. It was previously prohibited until Wednesday of week three of Spring Quarter.</li>\n<li>Recruitment events will begin the Sunday of week six of Winter Quarter, as opposed to week five.</li>\n<li>Recruitment plans, materials and agendas must be submitted to elections board by the Friday of week five of Winter Quarter.</li>\n<li>Campaign boards now cannot be set up before the start of soft campaigning.</li>\n<li>Candidate forums are mandatory except for class conflicts, severe illness or extenuating circumstances, which must be approved by the Elections Board.</li>\n<li>The final ballot must be approved by Senate no later than week two of spring quarter, as opposed to the previous deadline of week nine of Winter Quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Changes involving voting methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distribution of the votes will be handled through the proportional Scottish Method.</li>\n<li>Students cannot vote for the same candidate more than once or rank them in the same position twice.</li>\n<li>All the votes above the minimum threshold are proportionally distributed among the next available candidates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Changes involving overall elections:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mandatory candidate orientation meeting will now be held during the ninth week of Winter Quarter, rather than week eight.</li>\n<li>Parties will be held accountable for any “inappropriate campaign engagement” that may be done by party supporters.</li>\n<li>Party slate forms must be turned in during week nine of Winter Quarter rather than the previous week eight.</li>\n<li>A.S. spaces, revenues, spaces, staff or resources cannot be used while endorsing or opposing fee initiatives, referendums or petitions, unless it is educational.</li>\n<li>Elections Board “shall maintain the right to refer any complaints” to the correct entity, which includes, but is not limited to, Judicial Council, Judicial Affairs or Residential Housing Association (RHA).</li>\n<li>Intent to put an initiative, petition or referendum on the ballot is due by Friday at 4 p.m. during week one of Winter Quarter. For a fee initiative or referendum to be included in the ballot, signatures need to be collected beginning the sixth week of Winter Quarter and must be submitted by the eighth week of Winter Quarter.</li>\n<li>If there is a special election, the voter threshold will be determined by Elections Board.</li>\n<li>Once elections results have been ratified, any violations or complaints about the elections will deferred to the Attorney General rather than Elections Board.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resolution was student-sponsored by Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria and former Elections Board Chair Davis Quan.</p>\n<p>Renteria did not respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>The legal code acts as the governing outline of Associated Students (A.S.), outlining how Senate acts during meetings, what rules candidates need to follow when running for executive positions and so on.</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bill-to-Update-Election-Board-Legal-Code.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bill-to-Update-Election-Board-Legal-Code.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object><br>\n<a class=\"pdflink\" style=\"display: none;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bill-to-Update-Election-Board-Legal-Code.pdf\">Download Document</a></p>\n<p><a class=\"pdflink\" style=\"display: none;\" href=\"%22http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bill-to-Update-Election-Board-Legal-Code.pdf/a\"> </a></p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

I think they’re amazing. They’re diamonds in the rough but diamonds sure enough,” F4Y Executive Director Billi Jo Starr said.</p>\n<p>“It’s about the youth and what they’ve wanted and what they’ve asked for. It’s evolved from a complete bottom-up approach.”</p>\n<p>The campaign will donate 100 percent of the profits from the candles to the camp, according to the campaign’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“UCSB and our mentors have been a huge part of that sustainability because of their dedication and their outreach and their ideas, like the Re-Ignite the Light campaign,” Starr said. Most of the F4Y mentors have been personally impacted by juvenile incarceration, she added.</p>\n<p>UCSB F4Y focuses their efforts on helping juveniles while they are incarcerated as well as after they leave, according to Valerie Casillas, UCSB F4Y president.</p>\n<p>“They reach out to us wanting help and we do whatever we can to help them, whether it’s clothes that they need when they get out of camp, helping them look for jobs or career-building,” Casillas said. “We’re here to help every step of the way.”</p>\n<p>An unprecedented partnership between UCSB’s Comparative Literature Department and F4Y emerged when Starr and UCSB CCS professor, Rick Benjamin, co-taught a class titled Literatures of Juvenile Justice.</p>\n<p>Miguel Ramirez, a co-founder of F4Y and previous student of Starr’s outreach at the Camp, has firsthand experience with the struggles of the juvenile justice system and the opportunities of F4Y.</p>\n<p>“In the system, there’s a lot of rehabilitation programs offered for when we’re locked up, and when we get out, they just forget about us. The resources don’t extend to when we’re out and we need the help, suffering from peer pressure or problems at home,” Ramirez said.</p>\n<p>“Freedom 4 Youth was the only program that actually touched base on the outs… [Billi] never really told us to remove ourselves from the gangs. It was more of an outlet to stay away from them and towards positive outreach. It stuck.”</p>\n<p>Dylan Griffith, a returning UCSB student and supervisor of campus mentors, uses his knowledge to further understand the pitfalls of the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“[People] might not think it affects them directly, but their perception of people who are involved in the system or those who are system-impacted, drives their actions potentially more than they understand,” Griffith said.</p>\n<p>Along with the rest of the F4Y team, Griffith, Starr, Ramirez and Casillas participated in fundraisers such as the Re-Ignite the Light campaign and other projects, like creating holiday care packages for women and children in the Santa Barbara County Jail and sending families of incarcerated youth assorted gift cards.</p>\n<p>The care package project was organized by F4Y and was funded by UCSB Community Affairs Board and Associated Students.</p>\n<p>F4Y is also working to influence state policy; they recently visited Sacramento to speak with California state senators about the state’s current sentencing structure.</p>\n<p>All of the outreach, issues and upcoming projects were discussed at an annual F4Y conference held last May, which marked the seventh anniversary of the conference.</p>\n<p>F4Y’s ultimate goal is to both help juveniles resolve their issues and create foundations for their success in the future, Griffith said.</p>\n<p>“We’re not here to just fix problems. We’re here to plant seeds, to empower people to deal with their own lives in whatever way they choose.”</p>\n<p><em>Nyah Scott is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon and College of Letters &amp; Science Senator Xochitl Briseno proposed a resolution at the Jan. 23 Senate meeting which reflects on King’s impact during his time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The resolution, officially known as “The King’s A+ For Excellence Awards,” will award five student leaders who each exhibit “outstanding contributions to A.S or the student body as well as academic excellence.” Each award includes a $500 grant funded by A.S., according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Senate voted unanimously in favor of the resolution.</p>\n<p>“He was always going out of his way to support students academically and emotionally,” Solomon, a second-year history of public policy major, said. “That’s why I created the award, because it is specifically for students who go above and beyond who aren’t necessarily compensated for that.”</p>\n<p>Solomon, who first met King through a Guiding Underrepresented Individuals in Developing Educational Success (G.U.I.D.E.S.) Summer Orientation, remembered that he took the time to share academic tips to first-generation college students who were concerned about how to succeed in school.</p>\n<p>As an advisor, King, a former black studies major at UCSB, emphasized to his students the importance of grades and time management. King strived to ensure students had the time they needed to excel in school while fulfilling their roles in A.S. and extracurriculars, according to Solomon.</p>\n<p>“[King] would always walk into a room and be like, ‘How are we doing on grades? Thumbs up or thumbs down?’ or ‘Are we shooting for a 4.0?’” Solomon said. “Just reminding people that we’re students first and leaders second and he displays that as well.”</p>\n<p>Alexandra Gessesse, a third-year history of public policy major, former A.S. senator and student sponsor of the resolution, remembers first meeting King through the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E) in her first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The first thing he asked me was ‘What do you want to do with your time here at UCSB?’” Gessesse said. “It hit me that someone sees me as more than my purpose of running with a party or running in A.S. or being a 4.0 student.”</p>\n<p>King often went above and beyond to make sure that the students he worked with received the attention they needed to succeed, she said.</p>\n<p>“There would be days, like even if he’s busy in a meeting, his doors’ window blinds are never closed – they’re open – so you can see in and he can wave at you, so he can acknowledge you,” said Gessesse.</p>\n<p>However, academics weren’t always on King’s radar.</p>\n<p>After being accepted into UCSB when he applied in high school, the university rescinded King’s acceptance after he received multiple failing grades during his senior year of high school.</p>\n<p>Instead of attending UCSB out of high school, King attended a community college for a semester in order to regain his acceptance from UCSB.</p>\n<p>Like many of the students he worked with, King had commitments outside of academics during college. He was a member of the UCSB men’s basketball team, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, Incorporated, a transfer advisor, a member of 100 Black College Men and worked in the Educational Opportunity Program as well as the Early Academic Outreach Program.</p>\n<p>After graduating in 2001, King returned to the university to work as an assistant Judicial Affairs coordinator where he helped the run the judicial process for all university housing facilities on campus.</p>\n<p>King then left in 2008 to work as the assistant dean of students at the Claremont University Consortium.</p>\n<p>According to King, during his time at the Claremont University Consortium, he created a program called “A Plus,” where he helped give students academic advising.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“There would be days, like even if he’s busy in a meeting, his doors’ window blinds are never closed – they’re open – so you can see in and he can wave at you, so he can acknowledge you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Pretty much the way that I built A Plus was ‘What did I need when I was coming from Compton and Carson to Santa Barbara?‘” King said. “So I created A Plus for me… for 16, 17 year-old LaDonte King.”</p>\n<p>In 2011, King departed from the Claremont University Consortium. Four years after that, King found himself, once again, working for his alma mater.</p>\n<p>In the time spent between working for the Claremont University Consortium and UCSB, King managed two academic advising services: A+ For Excellence and Graduating Champions. Both services were derived from the A Plus program he founded while working at the Claremont University Consortium.</p>\n<p>Until last December, King specifically spent his time at UCSB engaging with A.S. senators and executives to aid them in their academic success.</p>\n<p>“Especially with regards to politics with such division, the one thing that everyone has in common is school. We’re all here for the same reason. You all are in school. So that’s going to be my thing,” King said.</p>\n<p>Although his time at UCSB was greatly appreciated, King made the decision to leave the university to pursue his passion and once again manage his academic advising services.</p>\n<p>“I’m so excited about it, I get to focus solely on my passion to work my noble purpose … to be able to solely focus on academic success. It’s like a breath of fresh air because I love this work.”</p>\n<p>Presently, King is the CEO of A+ For Excellence and Graduating Champions. While both services offer academic advising, Graduating Champions is catered to student athletes, like King himself, so they can better manage their time between sports and school.</p>\n<p>Although King is now pursuing his passions elsewhere, students like Gessesse find themselves reminiscing about their time with him.</p>\n<p>“I can’t envision what [students] will experience without him here, because that’s how much of an impact that he had … He was like my muse, my Pandora’s box to understanding my time here at UCSB,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or maxabrams@dailynexus.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Rumor has it that boiling water can cleanse a lot more than germs (sins). Come help cook for your community and stop by 777 Camino Pescadero at 2:30 p.m., when the cooking commences. At 5 p.m., you can serve the food at Little Acorn Park. After the cooking is done, clean those sins away (just kidding, the kitchen) at 6:15 p.m. back at 777 Camino Pescadero. The organization is always in need of new volunteers and cooks for vegan-only food using donations from farmer’s markets and the Isla Vista Co-op. </span></p>\n<p><b>Birote the Musical, Weep Wave and ///Internet</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If pass times treated you well this quarter and you don’t have any classes this Friday, then there is no better way to spend your night than at Biko Garage.

vote for the special election to be valid, according to Renteria.</p>\n<p>The voting threshold had been lowered for this election to compensate for low voter turnout in the previous Fall Quarter 2018 External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) special election.</p>\n<p>Initially, two students declared candidacy in the special election: Rachel Ng, a fourth-year biological sciences and global studies double major, and Richard Zierer, a fourth-year political science and English double major. However, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/zierer-drops-out-of-evpsa-election-ng-now-running-unopposed/\">Zierer dropped out of the race</a> on Jan. 23, leaving Ng unopposed.</p>\n<p>If the election meets the eight percent threshold by the deadline, Ng will only serve for approximately three months until the winner of the Spring Quarter 2019 election is sworn in.</p>\n<p>If elected, Ng hopes to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ng-is-sole-candidate-remaining-in-evpsa-special-election/#search\">center her agenda</a> around statewide affairs as it concerns sexual assault policy, common sense gun control and reproductive justice.</p>\n<p>This is A.S.’s third attempt to elect an EVPSA since Spring Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>The Fall Quarter special election occurred due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualification of Mayela Morales</a>, a fifth-year global studies and Chicano and Chicana studies double major, in May.</p>\n<p>Morales won the EVPSA position in April, but it was later discovered that she was not enrolled in any classes at UC Santa Barbara during the Spring Quarter, resulting in her subsequent disqualification.</p>\n<p>Madeline Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, was the sole declared candidate in the Fall Quarter special election. During that special election, however, the 16 percent voter threshold was not met and as a result, Loudon was not voted in.</p>\n<p>A.S.

The cookie program is also the country’s largest financial investment in girls annually.</p>\n<p>The Girl Scouts recently debuted “Caramel Chocolate Chip” for the 2019 season, accompanying the iconic line-up of Thin Mints, Samoas, Trefoils and more.</p>\n<p>This year, Girl Scouts sell cookies across campus in prime locations near the University Center, Pardall Tunnel and Davidson Library.</p>\n<p>Skyler, a local 13-year-old, set her stand in front of the library last Monday night. She said she has been selling cookies on the UCSB campus for the past two years.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of really enthusiastic people and it’s always a treat to be here,” Skyler said.</p>\n<p>Skyler experimented selling cookies at a variety of locations on campus and decided on the location based on where she found the most people.</p>\n<p>“As it gets later and people start to go to bed, I migrate over there,” Skyler said as she pointed toward the freshmen Chi-5 dorms.</p>\n<p>Thin Mints, Caramel Delights and Peanut Butter Patties are especially popular this year, according to Skyler. This year, Skyler’s goal is to sell 3,000 boxes of cookies.</p>\n<p>Lilly Rodriguez, the sister of two local Girl Scouts, posted on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page offering pre-orders for cookies. Within a day, she received over 50 messages.</p>\n<p>“I enjoy helping my sisters out so they can go on trips with their troop. My older sister is planning on going to San Francisco and my little sister will use the money for activities,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Many Girl Scouts are now accepting payment through Venmo, a mobile payment app, in an effort to increase sales to college students who may not carry cash.</p>\n<p>Sixth grader Olivia F. is excited by the increased profits from the usage of Venmo.</p>\n<p>“We love Venmo. We took over $1,000 on it at our UCSB cookie booth. Not all troops use it but we think it is a must,” Olivia said.</p>\n<p>“[Students] get very excited when they hear us yell ‘We take Venmo.’”</p>\n<p>Olivia is aiming to sell 500 boxes this year, enticed by the pair of narwhal slippers that she would win as a prize. She is optimistic about where the profits from this year’s sales will go.</p>\n<p>“We are using some of the money to go to Kaleidoscope, a large Girl Scout camping trip at Live Oak Campground. We haven’t voted how to spend the rest but last year we did horseback riding,” Farley said.</p>\n<p>UCSB students welcome the Girl Scouts to campus, as they bring back childhood memories and offer delicious cookies.</p>\n<p>“I was a Girl Scout for many years, and it reminds me of my days of selling cookies,” Anika Ahlstro, first-year communication and art history major, said.</p>\n<p>“The cookies bring me happiness whenever I eat them, especially Thin Mints and Tagalongs.”</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Feb. 10, 1:44 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Ashley Rusch and Amira Garewal are staff writers at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

living on campus, as required by Associated Students (A.S.) Legal Code for her position as an on-campus senator.</p>\n<p>“[By] not living On-Campus Yasamin Salari is unable to serve and adequately represent her constituents,” she said in the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Yasamin-Salari-Petition-Redacted.pdf\">petition</a>, which was filed on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Mukai could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Mukai references Article III, Section 1 Eligibility, Subsection B4 of Legal Code, which states that “Senate Representatives must live among their constituents during Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters of their year of elective service.”</p>\n<p>Senate granted Salari a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/on-campus-senator-yasamin-salari-admits-to-living-off-campus-in-violation-of-legal-code/\">one-time exception</a> at its Nov. 14 meeting during Fall Quarter 2018 after she spoke about her housing situation. During that meeting, she explained that she had originally planned to live on campus, but was unable to do so due to financial issues.</p>\n<p>Salari said in an email to the <i>Nexus </i>that she was “still waiting on more information about this whole situation” and would be able to discuss it further after midterms were over.</p>\n<p>According to a notice posted in A.S. Main by Judicial Council Chair Raymond Alonso, the council will be holding a hearing for the case on Feb. 20 at 6:30 p.m. in the Lobero Room in the University Center.</p>\n<p>At the Wednesday night Senate meeting, College of Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno introduced a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Policy-36.pdf\">bill</a> to create Standing Policy 36, which would address the issue of senators not living amongst their constituents, Salari in particular.</p>\n<p>The Senate tabled the bill for a week.</p>\n<p>The policy establishes rules for senators who change living arrangements or colleges while serving in their positions. Previously, senators with living arrangement issues were given one-time exceptions without an ensuing Legal Code change, the bill explains.</p>\n<p>The bill writes that senators who are no longer able to live among their constituents for external circumstances — which “may include but is not limited to Financial Insecurity, Physical and Mental Health, and experiencing Racism, Queerphobia, Transphobia” — will be given the opportunity to explain the situation before the Senate votes on whether to grant them a one-time exception.</p>\n<p>If they are not granted a one-time exception, they will be removed from the Senate.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simren Verma contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>Updated 10:46 p.m.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

It did damage to the ecosystem, the environment and the economy,” Carbajal said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>Carbajal is hopeful for his new bill, noting that the bill has a better chance of passing since it was submitted to a congress where a Republican majority is no longer in effect.</p>\n<p>“[In] the last congress, I was a minority, and the Republican lead leadership did not allow this to move forward. I’m very excited about the prospects this time around,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Of the 53 representatives in California, 42 have co-signed California Clean Coast Act, also known as HR 279, reflecting current sentiments to orient the state toward renewable energy  and away from oil and gas.</p>\n<p>“These are not abstract issues for the Central Coast and Santa Barbara. These are issues that we’ve experienced and to us, it’s tangible,” Carbajal said. “We need to wean ourselves and become less dependent on fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy.”</p>\n<p>In addition to HR 279, Carbajal has also proposed legislation on the subject of renewable energy.</p>\n<p>“Last term I introduced — which I am going to reintroduce again — the Renewable Energy opportunities legislation, which provides tax incentives to the business community so they invest in renewable energy technology.”</p>\n<p>The California Clean Coast Act would only be applied to the coastline and waters of California.</p>\n<p>To address California lands, Jackson, a state senator representing Santa Barbara’s 19th district, introduced Senate Bill 169, a new piece of legislation dealing with pipeline safety requirements, according to a press release.</p>\n<p>The current regulations in place allow pipeline operations in California to exploit loopholes within the state’s legal system, according to Jackson.</p>\n<p>“If you are operating a pipeline to full capacity, you have to follow California’s law. If, however, you are only operating to partial capacity, you don’t have to follow California law,” Jackson said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>SB 169 would require that all pipelines in California, regardless of their operation capacity, follow the same regulations, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>The bill would also ensure pipeline inspectors have the tools necessary to verify that all pipeline operations in the state are in compliance with the law.</p>\n<p>Jackson is hopeful that SB 169 will pass.</p>\n<p>“I’m confident that the legislature recognizes the importance of protecting against these spills,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>However, Jackson still holds some doubt about the fate of Carbajal’s legislation.</p>\n<p>She said that Carbajal’s “aspirational” bill would likely face legislative friction if it ever made an appearance on President Trump’s desk. However, she said the next couple of years could provide a less hostile environment for green legislation.</p>\n<p>“If we have a positive result in 2020, this is certainly the kind of thing that we should be pushing from,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>After previous attempts to remediate pipeline safety requirements through legislation, Jackson said she believes that there is only one definitive way to end disasters like this: “If you don’t drill, you can’t spill.”</p>\n<p><i>Simren Verma contributed reporting.</i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at maxabrams@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

not only to mitigate the disastrous effects the spill had on the environment, but also to create long-lasting changes in the way people outside of Santa Barbara remembered the spill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGinnes worked with community members in Santa Barbara to form the January 28 Committee, a group which, at the time, was organizing a commemoration event for the spill’s one year anniversary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Committee enlisted the help of Roderick Nash, UCSB professor emeritus of history and environmental studies, to write the Santa Barbara Declaration of Environmental Rights, which they planned to be read at their commemoration event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The document, written by Nash while he was </span><a href=\"http://taipd.org/node/263\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aboard a sailboat</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, acknowledged humans’ impact of the environment and helped to build a foundation for environmental rights, according to The American Institute for Progressive Democracy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back on campus, Nash led a group of 20 other professors at UCSB to discuss how students could be educated on not only the scientific but also the social dilemmas that resulted from the spill.</span></p>\n<div

in a system of values that the university reflected – change that would include environmental education as a respected academia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It wasn’t the chancellor calling for this action. It was coming from the students, the assistant professors, the people of the community who wondered why the campus couldn’t change to address these issues,” Nash said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their efforts lead to the implementation of an environmental studies department at UCSB, one of the first to appear in the country. The department brought together ideas from a range of academic fields and paved new paths for the discipline as a legitimate field of research and study.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB became a forefront of knowledge and scientific studies and expertise that helped give the environmental movement credibility,” Hankins said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nash became the first Chair of Environmental Studies in 1970, when the major was first established. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The spill represented a major turning point in how local communities and the nation at large thought about and acted toward the environment, McGinnes said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, in the water miles off the coast of Santa Barbara, oil rigs still float solemnly in the distance. Half a century after one of the country’s most devastating oil blowouts, they are faint reminders of the 1969 spill, their industrial figures fading into the decades of recovery since then.  </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [1:07 p.m.]: Nash’s full name is </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Roderick Nash, not Robert Nash, as stated in a previous version of this article.</em> </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe is an asst. news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at sofiamejias@dailynexus.com or news@daliynexus.com.<br>\n</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
