Anderle, the judge who ruled that the student may return to school, said that the evidence in the case “suggests UCSB never made an effort to contact Jane Doe to corroborate the statements attributed to her.”</p>\n<p>John Doe’s suspension will remain lifted even if the university places charges against the freshman. The stay on the suspension will remain in effect “up to and including any final judgment in that case, after all appeals, if any,” according to Judge Anderle’s ruling.</p>\n<p>The court ruled that UCSB must also assist Doe by giving him full access to all programs and activities at UCSB with no restrictions, returning him to his assigned on-campus dorm room, allowing him to complete all classes, giving him priority enrollment and providing any assistance necessary from any of the university offices.</p>\n<p>Judge Anderle said in his decision that the university took too long to investigate, failing to fulfill both the 60-calendar-day deadline federally required for Title IX investigations and the 60-business-day deadline agreed upon by the university.</p>\n<p>“The Court of Appeal found that the University’s inaction over such a lengthy period of time, leaving Petitioner in limbo, appears unreasonable and arbitrary,” Judge Anderle said in the court ruling.</p>\n<p>Judge Anderle ruled that the university had caused “irreparable harm” to the student by failing to conduct the investigation in a timely manner, leaving him suspended indefinitely.</p>\n<p>“This Court concludes that the University is intentionally doing indirectly what it is unwilling to do directly. The University has made a decision to deny John Doe the opportunity to enroll in the any [sic] of the first three quarters of his freshman year,” Anderle said in the court ruling. “But instead of making that decision based upon the facts, the law, and in fairness, it has decided to do it their own way.”</p>\n<p>According to Doe’s lawyer, Robert Ottilie, Doe moved into his on-campus dorm during Spring Break and said the university has been very helpful with the process of assimilating Doe to life in college.</p>\n<p>“They could not have been more helpful. The school has been responsive to the ruling,” Ottilie said.<br>\nUCSB spokeswoman Andrea Estrada said the university “will make every effort to ensure the student’s success” while they complete the adjudication process.</p>\n<p>“We respect the court’s rulings and have complied with the court’s order,” she said in an email.<br>\nOttilie said Doe is very happy with the decision because it now allows him to start his life, beginning with attending his “dream school.”</p>\n<p>Ottilie said he was not surprised by the judge’s ruling to remove Doe’s suspension, as he felt the law was clearly on his side.</p>\n<p>“It really wasn’t very much of a surprise. The law is very clear,” he said.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Doe has won his ruling to return to school, he still faces an ongoing investigation against him on behalf of the university, a lawsuit against that claim in court and several hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawyers’ fees that he must pay.</p>\n<p>According to the ruling, Doe has incurred over $100,000 in attorney’s fees and costs just through his filing in December of 2016. The ruling said he has “undoubtedly incurred substantially more in fees and costs since that time.”</p>\n<p>Ottilie said Doe is unable to pay that amount of money and does not expect him to pay the expenses anytime soon. Ottilie himself has incurred $50,000 of out-of-pocket costs from representing Doe against the university.</p>\n<p>As for what Doe will decide to study now that he has started school this Spring Quarter, Ottilie said he does not know what particular major the first-year will choose while at UCSB. Ottilie said it would not surprise him if Doe went on to study law later on.</p>\n<p>Ottilie also said he will continue to investigate abuses of the particular code in the Regents’ laws that the university has used to keep Doe and students in similar situations from attending school.</p>\n<p>Ottilie said new information has come out that suggests the university withheld information during the judicial process, so he also plans to amend the lawsuit to include four UCSB staff members involved in Doe’s 200-day suspension.</p>\n<p>Included in the proposed amendment are Kristi Johnson, principal investigative analyst of the Title IX office; Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs; Sandra Vasquez, associate dean of judicial affairs; and Brian Quillen, also principal investigative analyst of the Title IX office.</p>\n<p>Estrada said the university has not yet seen any amended complaint.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76691\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76691\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/","id":2424,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2423,2422,2421],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Mourns Loss of ‘Selfless’ Grad Student","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-06-at-5.25.51-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-06-at-5.25.51-PM.png?resize=661%2C468&ssl=1","description":"Samuel “Sam” Boldissar died on March 25 while rock climbing in Joshua Tree.

He was always rock climbing, always.”</p>\n<p>Jordan Hughes was a housemate of Boldissar and met him in 2014 when they began graduate school at UCSB. He said Boldissar came from a “family of climbers.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar enjoyed rock climbing, backpacking and camping. He also loved the Red Hot Chili Peppers, cooking and brewing his own beer.</p>\n<p>Hughes said Boldissar was “true to his own tastes” and interested in a variety of different things.</p>\n<p>“He spent his time on things he found intrinsically interesting,” Hughes said in an email. “He wasn’t in grad school for the degree. He did it because the problems he worked on were important and interesting to him.”</p>\n<p>A problem solver, Hughes said Boldissar once created a skunk trap in their backyard in Isla Vista. One night, he went to check on the trap and a skunk wandered into the house through the opened door.</p>\n<p>“Lots of yelling ensued and we miraculously avoided getting skunk spray in our house, but we did decide that the best defense was probably just to keep the door shut,” Hughes said in an email.</p>\n<p>Haley Snyder was Boldissar’s neighbor in Isla Vista and said “the best” she saw Boldissar was when they would sit in the living room “singing and playing drums.”</p>\n<p>“There’s not many people that you’re going to meet that were as genuine or as kind as Sam,” Snyder said.</p>\n<p>As an undergraduate transfer student at UCSB, Boldissar lived with seven other Isla Vistans: Patrick Sheehan, Paul Mazzella, Mike Wood, Tyler Rowe, Shelby Hendricks, Lewis Durand and Erik Romelfanger.</p>\n<p>Sheehan said the group lived together on the 68-block of Sabado.</p>\n<p>Sheehan and Mazzella explained how they once wrote a song for Boldissar titled, “Sammy Come Home,” because he was always working on campus at the Chemistry lab.</p>\n<p>“We ended up singing [the song] for the rest of the year and it sort of resonates right now,” Mazzella said.</p>\n<p>“We’d play it for him all the time and he’d think it was funny,” Sheehan added. “And now Sam has passed away and we want Sammy to come home. We loved him so much and wanted him around so much that we wrote a song about it.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca described Boldissar as “selfless” and said he “really just wanted to help anyone in need.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca said she and Boldissar went to Big Bear with friends and he helped a group of people get their car out of a ditch on the icy road.</p>\n<p>“Sam just walked over without a second thought … to go help these people, and he just got on the bumper and started pushing as hard as he could,” she said. “He’s the reason the car got out of the ditch. He did things like that all the time.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca and Boldissar were together for six months and she said they enjoyed taking walks on the beach and introducing each other to the things they each liked to do.</p>\n<p>Boldissar took Rebecca to the Santa Barbara Rock Gym and went to musicals like “Beauty and the Beast” because Rebecca loves musicals.</p>\n<p>Professor de Vries described Boldissar as “brilliant” and always willing to help other students in the research group with their own projects.</p>\n<p>“He was very good but in a humble way,” de Vries said. “He was involved in every project in the lab and helped every other student in the group.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar worked on multiple projects in the research group, and his most recent projects are being compiled for publication.</p>\n<p>“It’s wonderful his name is going to be in publications and in scientific journals,” Rebecca said. “I’m glad people are going to see the hard work he did.”</p>\n<p>Professor de Vries said he wants Boldissar to be remembered “with a smile.”</p>\n<p>“He always had this smile and everybody in our group is touched by him,” de Vries said. “He’s been so influential … [and] he had no idea how smart he was. There was never any showing off. It was just that smile.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar’s funeral will be held on April 22 at 11 a.m. at Redondo Union High School.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/","id":2423,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2422,2421,2420],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCs See Drop in International Applicants","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SIR-by-Rebecca-Baldree-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SIR-by-Rebecca-Baldree-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara saw a 10 percent increase in international undergraduate applicants for the 2016-17 admissions cycle, while two fellow UC campuses saw the first decreases in more than a decade.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UC Santa Barbara saw a 10 percent increase in international undergraduate applicants for the 2016-17 admissions cycle, while two fellow UC campuses saw the first decreases in more than a decade.</p>\n<p>The drop in international applicants to both UC Berkeley and UC Riverside comes amid diminishing global interest in United States universities. Observers correlate this decrease with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President.</p>\n<p>Among more than 250 colleges and universities across the country, more than 40 percent reported at least a 2 percent decrease in international applicants, according to findings released April 5 by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO).</p>\n<p>The UC saw a similar trend in 2004 and 2005 following the U.S.-led multinational invasion of Iraq. In contrast, American students responded to heightened political tensions following President George W. Bush’s declaration of a “war on terror” by showing an increased interest in studying abroad.</p>\n<p>According to Juan Campo, the UCSB Education Abroad Program director, this year’s increase in applicants to EAP programs around the world is related to controversy surrounding the new administration’s policies, mirroring the surge in applicants in the aftermath of 9/11.</p>\n<p>While there are currently no EAP programs in the six countries under Trump’s Middle East travel ban, Jordan is a popular location for students interested in studying in the region because of its central location and reputation as a reasonably stable nation.</p>\n<p>According to Campo, more UCSB students applied to the EAP programs in Jordan than ever before, with an increase from three applicants for the 2016-17 school year to 13 for the 2017-18 school year.</p>\n<p>“Our enrollments are up over last year, and I am not surprised,” Campo said. “[After 9/11] people were saying, ‘Oh, it’s going to go down,’ but no, because it may cause students to want to become more engaged with the world.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what’s happening now … It’s really heartening to see that and looking system-wide they have a higher number of applications at this time than they had last year at this time,” he said.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President has not yet determined if the drop in applicants of 1.2 percent at Berkeley and 2.2 percent at Riverside is linked to the national phenomenon, as official enrollment figures will be released later in April.</p>\n<p>Lisa Przekop, UCSB director of admissions, said it is difficult to determine whether the university’s international applicant numbers will be similarly affected in the coming years. She acknowledged that the current political climate in the U.S. is a legitimate concern for students abroad.</p>\n<p>“It’s important that we continue to communicate honestly with prospective students so we can address their concerns honestly, dispel inaccurate rumors, and show them that UCSB is a friendly community with esteemed faculty and talented students,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Przekop said the close proximity of the application deadline to the presidential election likely influenced students’ decision whether or not to apply to the UC.</p>\n<p>“There was election coverage that didn’t always show the U.S. as being welcoming to international guests,” Przekop said in an email. “Students abroad pay very close attention to what is happening politically in the U.S. and I’m certain that this played at least a small role in UC application numbers from international students.”</p>\n<p>Mahdi Golkaram, an Iranian mechanical engineering Ph.D. student at UCSB, said his peers in Iran have certainly been discouraged from studying in the U.S. since the implementation of the travel ban.</p>\n<p>According to Golkaram, the increasingly challenging process of obtaining a student visa, not the political tensions arising in the early months of the Trump administration, is the major deterrent for students debating whether to study in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day if they need to get the admission letter, clearance, background check, it takes a long time. I have a lot of friends they just gave up and they went to Canada,” Golkaram said.<br>\n“Right now, I have been talking to a lot of friends, and they don’t even think about applying to the United States anymore because they know how hard it will be for them to go through this whole process,” he said.</p>\n<p>Golkaram added that single-entry visas typically administered to international students make travel outside the U.S. nearly impossible, and he hasn’t left the U.S. for three years because he fears he may not secure a visa again.</p>\n<p>“I would rather not leave the United States at all, which means I’m not going to see my country again for a long time,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Golkaram, the inability to travel outside of the U.S. proves especially challenging for graduate students, who are often expected to attend conferences abroad.</p>\n<p>Simran Singh, director of the Office of International Student Services, said while the current political climate is likely a concern for international students, as well as for their parents, the more common barrier is posed by the complications in obtaining a visa.</p>\n<p>Though the recent five percent increase in UC tuition for non-California residents brought the total cost to $41,964, Singh said she believes the tuition hike is not a likely contributing factor to the decrease in international applicants.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the socioeconomic background of the students who are coming here, they really come from wealthy families and I don’t think that’s a deterrent per se,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>While UCSB has yet to see a decrease in international applicants, Singh said, it is important for all departments on campus to make them feel safe and promote a reputation that the UC is equipped with the proper infrastructure to support traveling scholars.</p>\n<p>“We are talked about as a world class research institution and what they really bring is the diversity,” Singh said. “These students bring so much of themselves when they come into our countries and into our institutions. We learn from them as much as they learn from us.”</p>\n<p>Campo said the nationwide decrease in international applicants is very understandable “given the chaos” surrounding the implementation of the travel ban and the university should be taking concrete steps to ensure international students are not “affected adversely” by policies emerging from the Trump White House.</p>\n<p>“The university has to affirm its place, not as a safe zone so much, but as a forum for bringing these issues to the surface and taking a clear stand on how a civil society remains open and tolerant to different points and perspectives to prevent people from being victims of racial violence or xenophobic or religious bias,” Campo said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76693\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76693\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/","id":3586,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3585,3584,3583],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Marquez said Miller always followed through with his commitments.</p>\n<p>“One of my fondest memories of David is really being able to always be certain that whatever he committed to, he was going to have — he would follow through,” she said. “He was very, very true to his word.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said she enjoyed visiting Miller in his office because he would have photographs of his family, and anyone who knew him would know he loved spending time with them. Miller had a wife and two young children.</p>\n<p>Marquez said Miller enjoyed working with students at A.S. and had previously worked at Grafikart, a photocopying business in what is now the A.S. Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Austin Hechler said he fondly remembers Miller as a person who got things done.</p>\n<p>“He wasn’t just there to do his job, he was there to make sure that everyone excelled at their job as well,” Hechler said. “Whenever I came into A.S. Publications, he’d shake my hand with a firm handshake, always smiling, always laughing.”</p>\n<p>Hechler said he remembers working with Miller on his initiative to make college textbooks more affordable.</p>\n<p>“All-around, genuinely a good man. Someone you would hope to emulate if you were an incoming A.S. staffer,” Hechler said. “They should emulate him, how he talked to students, how he treated those people around them and really just his general attitude toward helping students with things.”</p>\n<p>Hechler said A.S. is considering honoring Miller by naming a scholarship or a part of the A.S. building after him.</p>\n<p>“I do know that there are talks within Senate to introduce a resolution or do something in his honor, so maybe name the Publications building after him or the room after him or maybe a scholarship after him, for whatever he was passionate about,” he said. “Definitely something that we could do within A.S. to solidify his memory and what he did and the service that he provided for all the student body.”</p>\n<p>Miller’s friends have set up a memorial fund on the crowdfunding site YouCaring. In lieu of flowers, the friends ask that people consider donating to the fund in support of Miller’s wife and two children.</p>\n<p>Students who are in need of mental health support can contact Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) at caps.sa.ucsb.edu or (805) 893-4411.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/","id":2421,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2420,2419,2418],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Inspiring Student, Role Model Passes at Age 25","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-10-at-5.55.05-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-10-at-5.55.05-PM.png?resize=635%2C368&ssl=1","description":"Ismael Hernandez transferred from SBCC and was prepared to graduate from UCSB in June with a degree in biology.

It was a dream come true.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez had a “wakeup call” at the age of 17, she said, when his mother passed away around the same time he faced incarceration in juvenile hall. He attended his mother’s funeral in handcuffs, and he realized soon after that he needed to change his life for the sake of his three younger siblings.</p>\n<p>“He knew that if he continued on the path of delinquency or anything like that, it wouldn’t lead him to be a great role model for his siblings,” Rodriguez said. “At the end of the day, that’s what his mom wanted him to be; she wanted him to go to school and do great things.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez later graduated from a continuation high school and went on to enroll in Transitions, a program at SBCC which seeks to provide educational opportunities to individuals released from the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>Noel Gomez, a Transitions program counselor, remembers Hernandez telling the class on the first day that he was going to graduate from SBCC with a degree in biological sciences, go on to UCSB and become a doctor.</p>\n<p>“I can’t tell you how many times I hear that from a lot of students. Within a semester, students drop out or they don’t carry on with their goals. He actually went on and did it,” Gomez said.<br>\nFrom then on, everyone in the class started calling him “the doctor,” Gomez said. Hernandez valued hard work and would often study in the library for hours on end.</p>\n<p>“He couldn’t understand why people would come to SBCC and not focus on school,” Gomez said. “He took that as an opportunity that a lot of people don’t have, and he wanted to use it.”</p>\n<p>After five years at SBCC, Hernandez became the first in his family to graduate from college. He applied and got accepted into his dream school, UCSB, where he continued his studies in biology.</p>\n<p>His classmate and close friend Kathy Lopez said he kept to his diligent study habits, which he had maintained at SBCC. He volunteered in the emergency room at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, and he had plans to go to nursing school after graduation.</p>\n<p>Lopez said she and Hernandez would often hang out together after their biology classes. She said he would always want to stop by Root 217 in the UCen so that he could get “that fish sandwich he always wanted.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said one of the fondest memories she has with Hernandez is when they were reflecting on graduation by the UCSB Lagoon.</p>\n<p>“We were walking over past the lagoon — it was a really nice day, actually, and the lagoon didn’t smell so bad either — and he just looked over at the lagoon and was like, ‘Kathy, we actually did this; we’re actually here and we’re actually graduating. We made it,’” she said, adding that the two of them paid a visit to Root 217 soon after.</p>\n<p>Hernandez worked as a cashier at a liquor store to support his education and family. His sister, Karinna Hernandez, said he often told customers that he would take care of them when he became a doctor.</p>\n<p>His sister also said he greatly valued his family and that he especially loved his nieces.</p>\n<p>“He used to love being with my kids,” she said. “Every time he saw them, he would always give them kisses, and he’d always hold my oldest daughter and tell her he could bless her. He would always kiss her hand and tell her it was his blessing.”</p>\n<p>Karinna Hernandez said her brother became a role model for the family. She said he often encouraged her to prioritize her education, helping her pick her classes at SBCC and advising her to sit at the front of her classes.</p>\n<p>“He was a caring person with a big heart,” she said. “His smile was something that I think nobody can forget. He was such a loving person.”</p>\n<p>Friends and family held a funeral service for Hernandez on March 16 at Our Lady of Guadalupe in Santa Barbara. He was buried with his bachelor’s degree in biological sciences.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76689\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76689\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/","id":2422,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2421,2420,2419],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Hechler said 48 percent of students within the UCs identify as “food insecure.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like our food bank is humbly tucked away in the UCen and no one really knows about it, but we serve about 1,200 students a week, and that’s unreal compared to others,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hechler said he was the only one at the UC Council of Presidents who was able to say their campus had a successful food bank. He said UCSB is “way ahead” of other campuses in fighting student food insecurities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said that, aside from the food bank team, Hechler has “really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said the whole food bank team got together to fight for the expansion, and she hopes to see it completed before she graduates in June.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully with the work that we’re doing, we can destigmatize the desire and need to get food aid when you need it,” Jones said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

a drop in the ocean, rather,” said Theo LeQuesne, a UC Santa Barbara graduate student and Fossil Free UCSB coordinator.</p>\n<p>The Regents’ investments office has pulled funds from two companies — Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics — both of which are involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).</p>\n<p>Students at UCSB and across the UC system have held protests against DAPL’s construction in the months preceding March, calling for the University to divest from companies that support or plan to aid in the construction.</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said March’s announcement to reduce investments from such companies is a step in the right direction, but that it is “clearly not enough” because the UC “needs to be divesting funds more boldly.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a victory that has shown that what we are doing is working, but it also means we need to keep the pressure up,” he said. “We need to keep pushing further for our full goal, which is full divestment.”</p>\n<p>UC Regents Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh Bachher said repeatedly at the March 14 meeting of the Regents’ Investments Subcommittee, however, that the decision was based on investment risk and not public pressure on the topic, despite saying he had received 30 to 40 calls asking for divestment the day before the meeting.</p>\n<p>“We do not divest in our office. We will not make a statement trying to grab a headline irrespective of the pressure on the topic,” Bachher said at the subcommittee meeting.</p>\n<p>According to Bachher, the Regents’ investments office has been generally pulling investments from companies which have “higher sustainable investment risks.” He said his office decided to remove from its portfolio certain investments in fossil fuel companies because of “social, sort of more of the headline risks, sustainability-type risks attached to those names.”</p>\n<p>The UC has owned as much as $50 million in bonds with Energy Transfer Partners, an investment Bachher said his office has been gradually selling over time. The University now has $19 or $20 million invested in the fossil fuel company, which Bachher said he “clearly foresee[s] us moving out of in the near future.”</p>\n<p>The UC Regents divested approximately $200 million from coal and oil-sands companies in September 2014. Bachher said to the Regents in March that this was also a move to invest more sustainably.</p>\n<p>“In hindsight, it was probably a good move back then. And we’ve continued that process to what I would call where we have higher sustainable investment risk in particularly oil and gas exploration and production energy-type assets,” Bachher said. “We’ve continued to de-risk the portfolio as we’ve re-underwritten everything we own.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said he sees little to no difference between “de-risking” and divestment.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They are eager to call this process de-risking rather than divesting, but I think it’s important that we push back on that and say de-risking and divesting, all those mean the same,” he said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/fossil-fuel-activists-call-uc-divestment-just-a-drop-in-the-bucket/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/fossil-fuel-activists-call-uc-divestment-just-a-drop-in-the-bucket/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/fossil-fuel-activists-call-uc-divestment-just-a-drop-in-the-bucket/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/fossil-fuel-activists-call-uc-divestment-just-a-drop-in-the-bucket/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/fossil-fuel-activists-call-uc-divestment-just-a-drop-in-the-bucket/","id":3584,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3583,3582,3581],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Detained Skateboarder Faces Resisting Arrest Charges","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Skateboarder-detainment.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Skateboarder-detainment.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A UC Santa Barbara student whose forceful detainment in the Arbor went viral two weeks ago will be going to court during Spring Break to face charges of resisting arrest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UC Santa Barbara student whose forceful detainment in the Arbor went viral two weeks ago will be going to court during Spring Break to face charges of resisting arrest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County District Attorney filed the case of Erin Morgan, a fourth-year zoology major, with the Santa Barbara Superior Court on Monday, setting her court date for the morning of Mar. 27.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD officers arrested Morgan on Feb. 27 after she allegedly attempted to flee from receiving a citation for illegally skateboarding through the Arbor. The video of Morgan’s detainment, which went viral on Facebook in the days following the arrest, shows two UCPD officers in the Arbor taking Morgan down to her knees and then down to the ground on her stomach.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF591SOtago?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCPD spokesperson Sgt. Rob Romero, the two UCPD officers instructed Morgan to stop skateboarding and to wait as they handed her a citation. Romero said she waited “for maybe close to half a minute” before grabbing her skateboard and riding in the opposite direction from which she originally came.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the officers yelled at her to stop, but she continued to go. According to Romero, an officer then ran after her, grabbed the back of her backpack and took her to the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Romero, the officer tried to get her to place her hands behind her back, but instead she tried to stand up. He said when the second officer came to assist, they each grabbed one of her arms because she was trying to get up and then they “forcibly” took her to the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taking somebody to ground — if you ever played any type of sport or if you wrestled or anything like that — when you use force, it’s not pretty,” he said the day after the incident. “It’s not something we wish we have to use on people we arrest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Feb. 28, Morgan confirmed she tried to ride away from receiving her citation, but she said she did not expect the officers would use force to detain her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My biggest concern is just how quickly it came to that,” she said. “I didn’t think that just me skateboarding away would result in me getting thrown to the ground.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan also said she was booked in the county jail on the night of her arrest, and after paying a $2,500 bail, she returned home early the next day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Tuesday that she does not intend to challenge the charges of resisting arrest, but said she does intend to speak to a civil attorney about the forcible detainment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I walked away from him and that’s against the law. So I’m not going to try to fight that,” she said Tuesday. “He violated my civil rights. You can’t just throw someone to the ground for rolling away from a police officer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court records, authorities have charged Morgan for violating California Penal Code 148(a)(1). The law holds that a person who “willfully resists, delays or obstructs” a police officer shall receive a fine no greater than $1,000, a county jail sentence no longer than a year or both the fine and imprisonment.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

I think that’s going to help really create a more welcoming vibe for campus,” Jayne Reimel, assistant director for the Visitor Center and Spring Insight organizer, said.</p>\n<p>According to Sgt. Rob Romero, a UCPD spokesperson, smaller Deltopia crowds and Spring Insight will contribute to the decrease in fencing. Romero said UCPD currently plans to remove all the fencing along El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>“What we’re trying to do is scale back the police presence, scale back the fencing,” he said in an email. “We’re trying to make this a more welcoming community during that time, but still making sure that we have enough police presence there in case anything does end up getting out of hand.”</p>\n<p>Spring Insight, a day when admitted prospective students are encouraged to visit campus, typically occurs on the second week of April, and Deltopia occurs on the first weekend back from Spring Break. Coincidentally, both events will occur at the same time this year.</p>\n<p>Reimel said Spring Insight planners considered the admission decision release date and Easter holiday when scheduling the event.</p>\n<p>“We actually plan Spring Insight dates years in advance,” she said. “So we typically do them in chunks of three, four, five years at a time so this date has actually been planned for the past three years.”</p>\n<p>Because of Deltopia weekend this year, Spring Insight organizers also plan to keep prospective freshmen and families away from Isla Vista during the weekend by inviting families to eat at campus restaurants without mentioning places to eat in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Usually we tell people, ‘You can eat on campus … but you can also go to I.V. and try all these eateries,’” Reimel said. “This year we’re not doing that. We’re really trying to keep them focused on campus, amping up our programming up a little bit, trying to provide more to keep them engaged while they’re here.”</p>\n<p>Another concern of Spring Insight organizers is that Deltopia partygoers might take up parking spots on campus. Christopher Zbinden, the enforcement and guest services manager from UCSB’s Transportation &amp; Parking Services department, said although the university’s policy of “no weekend overnight visitor parking” has not changed, the department will create a way to distinguish vehicles staying for Spring Insight from those who are not.</p>\n<p>“If you’re coming into Spring Insight to register, you can actually print out a permit … there’s no cost, but it’s a way to identity those vehicles just in the event that one does stay overnight. That’ll help us best identify those people,” Zbinden said.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he encourages the UCSB community to provide a welcoming environment for prospective freshmen regardless of Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“Through the partnership with our students, I understand that they, like all members of our campus, take pride in our community and value the reputation of where they live, learn, and work,” Yang said in an email. “These are the values that I encourage all of us to convey as we welcome our prospective students and their families to our campus during Spring Insight.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76479\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/ucpd-to-cut-down-on-deltopia-fencing-due-to-spring-insight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76479\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/ucpd-to-cut-down-on-deltopia-fencing-due-to-spring-insight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/ucpd-to-cut-down-on-deltopia-fencing-due-to-spring-insight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/ucpd-to-cut-down-on-deltopia-fencing-due-to-spring-insight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/ucpd-to-cut-down-on-deltopia-fencing-due-to-spring-insight/","id":4441,"author":{"id":99,"name":"Parry Dong"},"related":[4440,4439,4438],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The bluff-side seats provided a panoramic view of the contestants in the water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First place went to James Burns, fourth-year financial mathematics and statistics major, because he was able to “get his feet on the nose of his board in every heat,” according to Benny Drescher, head organizer of the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Like in any surf contest, James won because he picked the right board for the day – a longboard, that is – and caught the best waves in each heat,” Drescher said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four judges scored the performances of each surfer. With each new round, the judges would drop the lowest-scoring surfers from the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They judge you on style, like if you fall or do something really well,” said Axel Eaton, fourth-year environmental studies major and competition contestant. “It’s subjective, but it’s the nature of the sport.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teams representing Greek houses joined in the competition, and each house donated a sum of money as part of their philanthropy efforts. Organizers also accepted donations from non-surfers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The competition raised $230 from contestant entry fees and general donations. Individual entries were $8 per person and $35 for teams of five. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proceeds from the contest will go toward the I.V. Surfrider’s campaign to distribute reusable party cups made entirely of recycled plastic. Some of the donations will also be sent to the Rainforest Action Network to benefit their Climate Action Fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want to do with our campaign is minimize the waste of red solo cups by replacing them with the reusable ones,” judge Marcus Vicari and current I.V. Surfrider president said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers hope to get a bulk order of the cups to distribute to the contestants who can then document how much they have used the cups, Vicari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefit competition is partly in response to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the middle of the Pacific Ocean that contains millions of pieces of polluting plastic, he said. The initiative stems from their “Rise Above Plastics” campaign that strives to help bring an end to single-use plastics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Surfrider foundation was founded on the thought to keep oceans clean and open to the public,” judge Zach Georgii of the San Luis Obispo Surfriders chapter said. “No person should be able to own a part of the ocean, and nobody should be polluting our waters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are also trying to get local restaurants in I.V. and Goleta to stop using single-use plastics in their “ocean friendly restaurants campaign.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Surfrider chapter also hosts beach clean-up days throughout the year in its efforts to keep local waters clean. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76437\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/i-v-surfrider-hosts-philanthropic-surf-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76437\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/i-v-surfrider-hosts-philanthropic-surf-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/i-v-surfrider-hosts-philanthropic-surf-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/i-v-surfrider-hosts-philanthropic-surf-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/i-v-surfrider-hosts-philanthropic-surf-competition/","id":4444,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[4443,4442,4441],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Report Shows Stability in I.V.

Despite the increase from the last year, Chuck Flacks, executive director of C3H, said the homeless population has remained “remarkably stable” in recent years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said because Isla Vista has “a very small sample” of people who are homeless, the 37 percent increase only reflects “one or two” more people coming in to I.V. since 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did see a small increase, but it wasn’t a huge increase, and the reality is that things have remained fairly stable,” Flacks said. “Population stays consistent as a result of homeless outreach and housing for the homeless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks said the “consistent” numbers are likely a result of homeless outreach organizations in Isla Vista such as the Pescadero Lofts, a complex that opened in 2014 to help keep homeless community members off the streets. The complex currently houses 35 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Flacks, the Pescadero Lofts are “proof” that through community outreach, counties can reduce the amount of people who are homeless living in an area. The Pescadero Lofts offer counseling for people as well as an alcohol and drug program.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The C3H report also showed that 33 percent of unsheltered people have health insurance, which Flack attributed to the Affordable Care Act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under the Affordable Care Act, we saw a huge expansion of people who are homeless getting access to Medi-Cal,” Flacks said. “Typically, we encourage them to go to primary health providers who accept Medi-Cal, and we’ve had a lot of success, seeing fewer people dying on the streets as a result of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks said, however, that many people who are homeless are worried about how lawmakers at the  federal government are  proposing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Flacks, Isla Vista is one of the “poorest communities in the county” and said the results of the homeless census do not account for the countless people who are “unstably housed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the need for affordable housing is “critical” when there are residents couchsurfing or living in doubled and tripled rooms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The census] is a baseline of the total homeless and potentially homeless population in I.V.,” he said. “The biggest problem — and that’s a countywide concern — is access to affordable housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks emphasized that aiding homeless community members can only reduce the homeless population. He said people who are homeless are reminders that “our system is not working” in regard to mental health and alcohol and drug treatment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Homeless people are like the canary in the coal mine for our society, and they’re a visible reminder of neglect,” Flacks said. “So when we have more people on the street, it means we’re doing something wrong.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/","id":4443,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[4442,4441,4440],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate then voted unanimously to table the bylaw for one week, but senators still did not produce the standard deviation on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>This bylaw has faced significant backlash from (BCUs). Certain BCUs feel that the bylaw negatively affects minority students and that Senate generally lacks communication with BCUs on issues that directly affect them.</p>\n<p>“Of course everyone wants their student fees cut,” Luvia Solis, co-chair for Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.), said.</p>\n<p>n light of the newly passed bylaw, she said she doubts S.C.O.R.E. will have the ability to put on conferences that have been attended annually.</p>\n<p>“In these conferences, it’s the only time when you get to network with other UCs and build coalitions, like for example, now immigration is a really big thing … At the Student of Color Conference there was an immigration caucus, [and] all UC students were working on how to work with the Regents, how to protect our students,” she said. “That doesn’t just happen through Facebook.”</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, co-chair of Queer Commission, said a decrease in conference allocations will pull funding from on-campus activities.</p>\n<p>“A lot of other organizations won’t be able to get their conferences, which means they will have to go to other funding groups,” Dumlao said. “Those groups are going to have to spend money that they would otherwise spend on weekly programming events [or] maybe other quarterly events.”</p>\n<p>He also said the funding Queer Commission received for conferences allowed them to put on more local programming for smaller queer groups.</p>\n<p>The bylaw also incentivizes certain post-event obligations. If the campus organization does not submit an event summary within two weeks or hold a workshop within two months, A.S. will place the group on temporary “funding probation,” which will prevent future funding until the requirements are met.</p>\n<p>Hobson said the Finance and Business Committee received only one post-conference report this year.</p>\n<p>Solis said she believes conferences are an investment.</p>\n<p>“Every single student came back to campus and is doing something now,” she said. “You learn things at conferences that you don’t get to learn here, and you always bring it back to your community.”</p>\n<p>She also said students of all backgrounds are welcome to join conferences.</p>\n<p>Both Solis and Dumlao expressed concern that, despite being co-chairs of BCUs, senators did not ask for their feedback even though the bylaw directly affects them.</p>\n<p>“How are you supposed to vote on something you have no idea about; you’re so disconnected,” Solis said.</p>\n<p>Last week, A.S. President Austin Hechler said it is important to communicate with BCUs, and he suggested that honoraria be made contingent on attending BCU meetings.

The workers laid the last segment of pipe on Tuesday evening and are now replacing the ground on top.</p>\n<p>The project faced significant delays due to the large storms as well as sporadic rain events throughout the winter that have led to extremely wet soil that is taking longer than expected to dry.</p>\n<p>The renovation may be further extended to replace a part of the bike path. Though this is not part of the infrastructure project, Foster believes it would be ideal to take advantage of cyclists already being rerouted.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done Herculean efforts to keep construction as minimal with regards to the extent of the work,” Foster said. “That slows us down a little bit, but I think that payoff is important to the students.”</p>\n<p>In order to minimize the project’s impact on students, project managers have extended construction hours as late as 10 p.m. in attempts to finish construction sooner.</p>\n<p>Ray Aronson, associate director of Design &amp; Construction Services, said financing for the infrastructure project comes from the state’s annual budget. Phase 1B, which was done by Tierra Contracting, totalled $6.5 million, while the contract with D-KAL Engineering for phase 1C was $2.3 million.</p>\n<p>According to Michael McGrogan, financial planning analyst, UCSB will not be responsible for payments on the loan, which came from the UC Office of The President. The office will repay the loan through state appropriations.</p>\n<p>Also included in phase 1C is the Lagoon Road stormwater drainage project, which will create a new pipeline to reroute runoff water into the lagoon instead of off the eastern bluffs.</p>\n<p>The project will abandon and cap the existing drainage pipes and remove the sections that extend past the bluffs. This may help prevent bluff erosion, which could potentially affect the new pipeline in 100 years.</p>\n<p>The new pipeline is installed between 30 and 200 feet away from the bluffs’ edge.<br>\nA lagoon hydrology study was prepared in 2008 to analyze the hydrological impact of this project. The study found that this would only moderately increase the lagoon’s water levels and showed there would not be a significant increase in pollutants, since the lagoon already contains high levels of copper, phosphorus and nitrogen.</p>\n<p>The report recommended a bioswale to improve water quality, prompting the San Nicolas Restoration project as part of phase 1A. A bioswale is a landscape technique designed to remove silt and pollution from surface runoff water.</p>\n<p>This may improve water quality in the lagoon by diluting current water with water that does not have the pollution present in previous storm runoff.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Ottilie, addressed to the Regents and the Office of the Chancellor at UCSB, the university has suspended Doe indefinitely since the end of August despite not having charged him with any violation of rules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yet, even though my client has never been charged by UCSB with any violation of University rules, he sits out of school and it is now clear he will miss the entire school year unless a court ultimately intervenes,” Ottilie said in the letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said UCSB abused a certain section of the UC Regents’ policy on student conduct to hold Doe in suspension, and he wrote in his letter that he hopes they will revoke the statute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to be certain the two of you [Chancellor Henry Yang and the Regents] know how the Regents’ statute, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">§</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">105.08, has been abused at UCSB this year. I write for myself, in an effort to educate you and others to revoke this statute,” Ottilie said in a letter. “It seems to me that there is a pattern. Remove certain students from campus, tell them it is only ‘temporary’ until they are investigated, provide little or no support, and then just not investigate. Students without resources will give up and go away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their brief to the court of appeal, the Regents said “the 19-second video depicting [Doe] threatening to assault a young woman amply justified the interim suspension while the University completes its investigation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said Doe’s suspension violated the statute’s requirement that the student appears  likely to commit violence or be a threat to safety and that the suspension be the “least restrictive necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents said in their brief to the appeal court that they deemed the video evidence sufficient to prove the student was a threat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here, the threatening video coupled with additional evidence in the University’s possession provided the University with sufficient cause to believe [Doe] posed a sufficient threat to campus safety,” the Regents said in their brief.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said he was concerned about the way that university suspended the incoming student without being given charges and said he had “never heard of a school that suspends students without charges.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said he discovered the case of another student in a similar situation who has also been suspended from UCSB without charges of violating the university’s rules. The other student, referred to as Susan Doe in the letter, “has been missing her entire freshman year, suspended without any underlying investigation, let alone charges or conviction.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe filed an emergency petition for a writ of prohibition to the court of appeal on Feb. 3, which the court accepted on Feb. 7 but has not yet granted. A writ of prohibition is an order from an appellate court to a lower one directing the lower court to act in a particular way. In the lawsuit, John is seeking an injunction from the appellate court which would in effect end his suspension. Ottilie expects the appellate court will give a decision on whether it will provide his client’s requested injunction on his suspension before the beginning of the Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ottilie, John and Susan Doe are both minority students and, in his letter, raised the concern that the university is mistreating them by providing suspensions that they are unable to legally contest because of a lack of financial resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It certainly concerns me that one of the most powerful institutions in our State has treated two young minority students, without financial resources, in such a way,” Ottilie said in a letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said she could not comment on the particular case, but she said the university holds the “safety and wellbeing” of students as its “highest priority.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are committed to policies that protect our campus community and survivors of assault while affording fair and consistent due process to those who have been accused,” Estrada said in an email. “The University recognizes the need to ensure that community members have the right to equitable procedures, and we strive to treat each student with dignity and respect.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: The language regarding John Doe’s emergency petition was made clearer to show the relationship between the appellate and lower court.</em></p><div

Iranian immigrants, “it’s never going to be safe” to live in the United States <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Maryam Rasekh sat in front of a computer in Iran on Jan. 27, rapidly refreshing her computer screen to determine whether she could return to Santa Barbara and complete a graduate degree.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump had issued an executive order hours earlier banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. As news began spreading throughout the affected countries, Rasekh learned firsthand that she was one of three UCSB students barred from reentering the U.S.</p>\n<p>For one month following the executive order, Rasekh remained at her home in Iran, unable to return to her studies at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The worst thing about it was the rollercoaster,” she told the <em>Nexus</em> in an interview Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Her first instinct was to wait. She said she had heard “horror stories” of immigrants waiting in limbo at U.S. airports as Customs and Border Protection agents denied visas that many of them had waited months — or even years — to attain.</p>\n<p>All she did was write an email to the embassy asking what had happened.</p>\n<p>Over a week later, a federal appeals court lifted the travel ban. The U.S. embassy responded to her email saying she would receive a visa once again.</p>\n<p>When she obtained her first visa to the United States in 2013, Rasekh had traveled on plane to Ankara, Turkey, the nearest U.S. embassy to Iran. Because Rasekh did not want to make the trip again in early February, she paid a visit to an Iranian travel agency to request they go on her behalf.</p>\n<p>When she returned home from the agency, Rasekh looked on her computer and found another response from the U.S. embassy. The officials told her to “hold off, disregard the previous email and just wait.”</p>\n<p>“I was still scared, [thinking] ‘will they mark it as rejected? What will they do?’” she said.</p>\n<p>Almost another week passed by until the embassy had updated her visa status again. On Feb. 16, the U.S. embassy once again assured her the valid visa that Trump’s travel ban had denied.</p>\n<p>Rasekh returned to UCSB last Monday, Feb. 27, just days before Trump issued a modified executive order on March 6, lifting some restrictions and cementing others.</p>\n<p>The new travel ban allows entry for current U.S. visa holders and refugees who have already been granted asylum and removes travel restrictions from Iraq. Students with J visas, such as Rasekh, will be allowed entry. The ban will go into effect March 16.</p>\n<p>“I scraped past,” she said, adding that many of her family and friends may remain unable to enter the U.S. in the months to come.</p>\n<p>Rasekh’s return last Monday marks the third time she has made the trip to the U.S. She first came to UCSB in February 2013 to join as a researcher in the electrical engineering department.</p>\n<p>It was during her time as a researcher that she met her boyfriend Hassan Arbabi, a fellow Iranian and researcher in the mechanical engineering department. Arbabi acted as a correspondent to the <em>Nexus</em> on Rasekh’s behalf when she was barred in early February.</p>\n<p>“He was actually more stressed out than me. Even when the ban was lifted, he was like, ‘Don’t come on Monday; come on Sunday because you don’t know, maybe he’ll sign a new one,’” she said. “He was really trying to shield me from all his stress and anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Rasekh said her sister, who studies at Boston University, was also worried for Rasekh during Trump’s travel ban. She even tried to put Rasekh in touch with Joe Kennedy, the U.S. Congressman out of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>“Everybody here was more stressed out than I think myself,” Rasekh said.</p>\n<p>For the two weeks since her return, Rasekh has been continuing her research in the engineering labs. Because of her prolonged stay in Iran, Rasekh missed a conference on Feb. 21, where she was supposed to present her research, and she was unable to enroll for courses in the Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“I arrived too late,” she said.</p>\n<p>Rasekh still expects to receive her Ph.D. in April, although she is unsure whether she will stay in the U.S. after that point.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if U.S. still looks like a good prospect for living,” she said. “I think it’s in the back of all Iranians’ minds that maybe we should plan long-term on somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>She said Trump’s latest actions lead her to believe that, for Iranian immigrants, “it’s never going to be safe” to live in the United States.</p>\n<p>“And it’s not just laws. Just the general atmosphere; if it’s going to keep going toward all this tension, then it’s bad for everybody,” she said. “There’s a reason people choose the U.S. to work and live in, and this could be hurting that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/","id":2418,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2417,2416,2415],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":80,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
