Pardall Center to help SBCC students and I.V. community members receive library services close to home.</p>\n<p>The outreach program is designed to provide SBCC students who live in I.V. with easier access to the campus library’s resources. SBCC Mobile Librarian Kristen LaBonte will be available Wednesday nights in the Pardall Center from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. to provide locals with services such as research and homework assistance.</p>\n<p>LaBonte said she will be available to help students with a wide range of assistance services.</p>\n<p>“I help out with technology questions, research relating to term papers, personal research that people are doing, general questions and technical things like people’s personal devices,” LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>Although the program’s main objective is to provide resources for local SBCC students, LaBonte said she is happy to help anyone who stops by.</p>\n<p>“I help everyone. I don’t ask for anyone’s affiliation. That’s actually common practice with libraries,” LaBonte said. “We don’t discriminate; we are open to everybody.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Library Director Elizabeth Bowman explained the reasoning behind the new service.</p>\n<p>“So many of our students live in Isla Vista and struggle with bus availability or don’t have a car or, for whatever reason, want to stay here in I.V.,” Bowman said. “We do have online resources, which are great, but to have someone here for an extended time who can offer extensive help is invaluable. Students have told us that they like our library and our hours, but they like to stay here [in Isla Vista].”</p>\n<p>Ethan Bertrand, SBCC Associated Students Isla Vista community representative (IVCR), said the project is the result of collaboration with the Pardall Center and UCSB Associated Students leadership.</p>\n<p>“Within our student government last year, we saw a need for services in Isla Vista, so we created the IVCR position,” Bertrand said. “This is one of my roles with that, to work to support City College interests in the community and support students.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the news of the project’s launch has been well received.</p>\n<p>“So far we’ve heard a lot of great things. This originated due to feedback from students. This event is us saying we’re here and to please come use our services,” Bertrand said. “I think the greatest part about it is it’s not just for City College students, it’s also for the whole community, whether it’s UCSB students, longtime community members or families.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, SBCC trustee, said he helped coordinate the project by using the knowledge and connections he made as a former Associated Students (A.S.) President at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I coordinated this space. I was A.S. President, so I had connections and knowledge of Associated Students. So I brought both together, both my involvement with SBCC and my past involvement in A.S.,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he thinks the new service will serve I.V.’s SBCC population well and hopes it will expand to include more services for SBCC students in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great that we’re providing services for SBCC students. There are about 3,000 [SBCC] students living in I.V., and they do need services. SBCC is far and it’s not feasible for students to make it over there all the time,” Abboud said. “I hope that this, in the future, expands to include more than library services like transfer services and financial aid services.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on pages 1,7 in the Thursday, Friday 18, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68394\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68394\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/cc-library-brings-resources-to-i-v/","id":4569,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4568,4567,4566],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The country promised reconstruction of sidewalks on Sabado Tarde and Del Playa but specific details of when and which sections of the sidewalk will be rebuilt have yet to be disclosed. Lighting in I.V. has been limited due to SB Ordinance 5035, which aims to prevent light pollution in parks, viewed by some as a safety hazard. Attendees also discussed replanting the trees removed years ago in front of I.V. Theater and adding gutters to ease the street flooding during rainy weather.</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Andrew Pragin said the removal of trees surrounding I.V. Theater made him realize the important role they played in the surrounding environment.</p>\n<p>“I never really realized how significant that tree removal was until I saw the pictures,” Pragin said. “It’s incredible how much shade and greenery they provided.”</p>\n<p>LuAnn Miller, executive director of I.V. Youth Program and 31-year resident, said the county only permits certain species of trees in the area that match the surrounding ecology.</p>\n<p>“There is an approved list of trees from the county that you can plant,” Miller said. “Ficus I don’t believe is on it. Flowering pears are, however. Those are the ones that are blooming white allover right now.”</p>\n<p>Ken Masuda, volunteer with Assemblymember Das Williams’s office, said I.V. should consider trimming some of the trees because they block street illumination.</p>\n<p>“There are places in I.V. where the street light, which is supposed to illuminate the street and sidewalk, is not getting there because of branches and leaves in the way,” Masuda said. “So I think if we’re going to have a tree program there would be two aspects: tree planting and tree trimming.”</p>\n<p>Miller said I.V. parks and streets are not well lit, which can lead to increased crime.</p>\n<p>“During the winter we have less participation in the ESL [English as a Second Language] classes in the evening at I.V. school because there is not a safe passageway from where students live to get to the elementary school,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Professor of art Kim Yasuda said the need for lighting can be remedied with blue LED lights in dimly lit areas as a permanent version of the Blunite memorial art instalment that took place last spring to memorialize the events of May 23, 2014. This form of lighting would be less obstructive to the surrounding environment, according to Yasuda.</p>\n<p>“We have Blue Light organized by students who are planning for a community illumination effort,” Yasuda said. “The larger commission could make it long term.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, Field Representative for Williams’s office, said reconstructing sidewalks will provide pedestrians a safer alternative to walking on streets.</p>\n<p>“It is a lot better for liability and safety purposes, especially public safety, to be able to say there are sidewalks on the streets even if they are not being actually utilized,” Schunk said. “This is the logic for governance.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/i-v-stakeholders-talk-infrastructure-spending/","id":4570,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[4569,4568,4567],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie Hold Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Debate_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Debate_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"More than 80 students filled the Flying A room of the UCEN Tuesday to attend a formal debate between representatives from College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>More than 80 students filled the Flying A room of the UCEN Tuesday to attend a formal debate between representatives from College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie.</p>\n<p>After months of negotiations, the two groups, each represented by two debaters, held an event to discuss the feasibility of a higher minimum wage and tuition-free public college.

id=\"caption-attachment-68326\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Andrew Gates, second-year economics and accounting major and member of College Republicans, began the debate by questioning the demographics of minimum wage workers.</p>\n<p>“This popular belief that minimum wage workers are low-income adults working 40 plus hours a week to fend for their families and children is simply not true,” Gates said. “In actuality, only about 4.7 percent of minimum wage workers are low-income adults providing for their families.”</p>\n<p>Gates then cited the U.S. Department of Labor to claim minimum wage has negative effects on the economy and employment.</p>\n<p>“The US Department of Labor’s own assessment of the first minimum wage — this was commissioned by FDR — found that it resulted in job losses for 30,000 to 50,000 workers,” Gates said. “That’s 10 to 15 percent of the 300,000 workers who previously earned below that.”</p>\n<p>Eric Villalobos, third-year religious studies major and head organizer of UCSB for Bernie, argued in favor of a minimum wage increase.</p>\n<p>“A 2013 study by the Chicago Fed [Chicago Federal Reserve] found that increasing the minimum wage even just to $9 an hour would increase consumer spending by $28 billion,” Villalobos said. “It frees up money from the employer and from the business and makes it goes into the lower wage workers’ pockets.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said raising the minimum wage can lead to an increase in employment.</p>\n<p>“So far there is no evidence that raising the minimum wage causes an increase in unemployment or job loss,” Villalobos said. “In fact, in a Goldman-Sachs analysis of 13 states which have raised their minimum wage, it found that states where minimum wage went up had faster employment growth than states where the minimum wage remained at its 2013 level.”</p>\n<p>Ron Papile, third-year economics major and executive director of College Republicans, responded to Villalobos’ claim by citing studies on labor and the food industry that show prices rise with wages.</p>\n<p>“A 2007 study from the federal reserve bank of Chicago found that restaurant prices unambiguously increased in response to minimum wage,” Papile said. “Furthermore, a study by the German Institute for the Study of Labor found that, especially in fast food restaurants, roughly two-thirds of the minimum wage increase would actually lead to price increases.”</p>\n<p>Papile then discussed price increases in fast food restaurants.</p>\n<p>“Think about something like McDonald’s or Taco Bell, where you have a product that costs only $1 to buy – a $1 burger or taco,” Papile said. “The only reason that the prices are so low is because they’re matching the benefits they can get to the cost of creating the products.”</p>\n<p>Guy Singer, third-year biopsychology major and co-chair of UCSB for Bernie, had the last word on the issue of minimum wage.</p>\n<p>“600 of the nation’s most prolific economists authored a collective letter in 2014 supporting the notion that reasonable minimum wage increases had little or no effect on employment,” Singer said. “Even from the small business owner’s perspective there’s quite a tight consensus on raising the minimum wage.”</p>\n<p>The debate then shifted to the issue of whether or not public universities should be tuition free.</p>\n<p>Villalobos began by arguing that free tuition is not a new concept and has been implemented in many countries.</p>\n<p>“The campaign would like to argue that this is not a radical idea; last year Germany eliminated tuition because they believed that charging students $1,300 dollars per year was discouraging Germans from going to college,” Villalobos said. “Next year Chile will do the same, as will Finland, Norway, Sweden and many other countries around the world.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos then discussed democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ plan to address student loans.</p>\n<p>“The formula for setting student loan interest rates would go back to where it was in 2006,” Villalobos said. “If this plan were in effect today interest rates on undergrad loans would drop from 4.29 percent to just 2.37 percent.”</p>\n<p>Gates said government subsidies would actually increase the cost of tuitions.</p>\n<p>“As government subsidizes tuition, the cost of tuition increases proportionately,” Gates said. “The federal reserve bank of New York found that tuition and fees increased in proportion to the number of eligible students.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68325\"

subsequent crash.</p>\n<p>“In 1995 when the government subsidized mortgage loans, banks began loaning indiscriminately knowing that the government would cover it, increasing demand for housing and driving up prices of homes,” Gates said. “As government subsidizes, tuitions are hiked because colleges have no incentive to reign in that cost of tuition.”</p>\n<p>Singer responded by saying capable students should have the right to attend the colleges of their choice, regardless of income.</p>\n<p>“If you get accepted you should have the right to go to that university regardless of how much money your parents make,” Singer said. “The way we lose scientists and technological advancement is by selecting who gets to go university based on income.”</p>\n<p>Singer then defended the idea of socialism in public education.</p>\n<p>“A hundred years ago completely subsidized public high schools were called socialist, 300 years ago completely subsidized public elementary schools were called socialist, and now they say completely subsidized higher education is socialist,” Singer said. “How many times do we have to go through the process before we figure out that socialism isn’t a scary word?”</p>\n<p>Papile said the large increase in students at universities would negatively impact the ability of students to take impacted classes.</p>\n<p>“Graduating with a bachelor’s degree in six years is actually about 59 percent of students, which to me is a very shocking statistic and shows how impacted classes currently are and how difficult it is to get them,” Papile said. “If we flood colleges with more students, it’s only going to make classes harder to get into.”</p>\n<p>Papile also said private universities would be unable to compete with public universities if public university tuition was free.</p>\n<p>“How are private universities going to compete with public universities if public universities are going to offer free tuition,” Papile said.</p>\n<p>Emily Anne Williams, a first-year linguistics major, said she thought the debaters were well-informed and prepared.</p>\n<p>“I think both sides did very well,” Williams said. “I heard a lot of statistics thrown around, which I think most college students don’t know about, and it was nice to see four people who actually did research.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Reardon, third-year physics and philosophy double major and president of College Republicans, said he was happy with how the speakers handled the debate.</p>\n<p>“I was very pleasantly surprised and, honestly, there aren’t many ways it could have gone better,” Reardon said. “Nobody couldn’t answer a question, everyone was very well informed on the topic and I’m happy with how it went for both sides.”</p>\n<p>Emily Humpal, a third-year political science major, said she thought having the two clubs debate was beneficial for the student community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great that we have the two clubs coming together because we don’t have a lot of students active in the political arena,” Humpal said. “These issues affect us, and I think a lot more people need to know that.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An initial version of this article listed the name of College Republicans’ executive director as Ron Kapeel, when his actual name is Ron Papile. Also, the article states the debate addressed whether the federal minimum wage should be raised from $7.25 to $15.00 over the next 8 years. However, the topic was an increase over several year, not 8 specifically.</em><em>]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/","id":2529,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2528,2527,2526],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Curtis Marez Lectures on Farm Worker Resistance Movements","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Curtis Marez, associate professor and chair of Ethnic Studies at UC San Diego, presented an interactive lecture about farm worker resistance movements on Tuesday in the Multicultural Center (MCC), bas...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68328\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68328\" data-attachment-id=\"68328\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/farming_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Farming_by Lorenzo Basilio-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68328\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Dr. Curtis Marez looks at how the appropriation of photography, film, video, and other technologies expressed a “farm worker futurism,” a set of farm worker social formations that faced off against corporate capitalism and government policies.

According to Marez, many farm workers have started social justice movements to combat inequalities created by corporate capitalism and government policies. Marez’s talk was the last lecture in the MCC’s Race Matters Series.</p>\n<p>Associate Professor in the Chican@ Studies Department Dolores Inés Casillas introduced Marez and said she has appreciated his writing since he was president of the American Studies Association.</p>\n<p>“I am excited to see him on our campus,” Casillas said. “Something that is really dear to my heart is that Curtis is the first person whose work I read. I read an article by him, and it was the first time I felt I had to email the person and tell them this was an incredible piece of writing.”</p>\n<p>Casillas said Marez’s hometown of Turlock, California is present in his writing and adds to his understanding of farming in the Central Valley.</p>\n<p>“He references not just the Central Valley, but in a way in which we understand that farm hands have created and cultivated a specific culture in the Central Valley,” Casillas said.</p>\n<p>According to Marez, farm workers have been leaders in visionary thinking about the future of technology, but little is known of their work.</p>\n<p>“One index of farm worker exploitation is the fact that they have often been the objects, but rarely the subjects of media representation,” Marez said. “There is a vast archive of photos and films of farm workers, but there are far fewer well-known examples of visual media produced by them.”</p>\n<p>Marez said California farm workers unions have organized and created their own media to fight agribusiness domination of visual technology.</p>\n<p>“Farm workers have undermined agribusiness representations of workers as mere machines of production, by themselves mobilizing media technologies,” Marez said. “Appropriations of cameras and other visual technologies by farm worker unions have both material and symbolic force, making exploitation visible while simultaneously seizing the means of visual reproduction.”</p>\n<p>Marez showed attendees a clip of Cesar Chavez dancing to remind them of the utopian, world-changing arc of the farm worker’s movement. Cesar Chavez, American farm worker and labor rights activist, founded the United Farm Workers (UFW).</p>\n<p>“We are used to seeing Chavez in a serious mode,” Marez said. “Just remember that he was a person who danced, who had desires for pleasure and pursued those desires I think is something that is important. Part of what I wanted to talk about today is the utopian future orientation of United Farm Workers in what I am calling <em>Farm Worker: Futurism</em>.”</p>\n<p>According to Marez, his book is an interdisciplinary study of the material and symbolic significance of technology in conflicts between agribusiness corporations and workers of color in California from the 1940s to present day.</p>\n<p>“An important practical and symbolic means of exploiting and disciplining labor [and] agribusiness technology also became the medium and object of struggle over the future of California agriculture and the larger cultural and political context supporting it,” Marez said.</p>\n<p>Marez said farm workers have used technology to draw attention to the agribusiness flaws in using mechanized labor, industrial work camps and pesticides in the fields.</p>\n<p>“They have also responded to the agribusiness efforts to dominate the visual field by turning a critical gaze on agribusiness in numerous graphics, photos, films and videos, thus decoupling technology from an exclusive connection to patriarchal white capitalism,” Marez said.</p>\n<p>Marez showed artwork by members of the Royal Chicano Air Force, a Chicano artist collective, and said the images show flight and the technologies of agribusiness, such as the crop duster.</p>\n<p>“All of the images in this project from the Royal Chicano Air Force are from special collections here at UC Santa Barbara,” Marez said. “So there is an incredibly rich collection of visual art related to the Chicano movement right here on this campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Marez, farm workers unions have tried to mobilize media technology to open spaces for supporters. Marez said Cesar Chavez’s famous slogans “Si Se Puede” and “It Can Be Done” demonstrate the uniting qualities of the farm worker movement.</p>\n<p>“Qualities that resonated with post-war decolonization and third-wordlist movements,” Marez said. “The worlds that farm workers built were shaped by both local and global concerns.”</p>\n<p>Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman, Programmer of the MCC, said she enjoyed how Marez allowed the audience to choose a topic of discussion for his lecture.</p>\n<p>“I really appreciated how Dr. Marez was so interactive with the audience and allowed them to choose where to take the lecture. I have never seen anyone do that,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It could have been a totally different lecture if people chose different things — I thought that was interesting. I really find his work fascinating.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

American Religion and Culture course (RG ST 155) on Tuesday, accompanied by a panel comprised of mostly female United States war veterans to discuss the current condition of Vietnam War veterans in the United States.</p>\n<p>Capps’s late husband, UCSB Religious Studies Professor Walter Capps, originally developed and taught RG ST 155 in 1979. The class gained national attention during this time, and had a peak enrollment of nearly 900 students. The discussion panel featured Wilson, a Vietnam War veteran, Marty McGrath, a US Navy air traffic controller third class, Janice Summers, a US Navy Officer third class dental technician and Vietnam War veteran, Penny Turner, U.S. Army air defense artillery desert storm and Arlene Sandoval, a US Airforce senior airman and aerospace medical technician. Each gave an account of their experiences during and after their time of service.</p>\n<p>Representative Capps said many Vietnam War veterans were not treated fairly when they returned from service.</p>\n<p>“Some [veterans] hid up in the hills. There was no re-entry program. There was no phrase ‘post-traumatic stress disorder,’” Capps said. “They were alienated, disoriented, couldn’t talk to their families, couldn’t speak to anyone about it. So some fought back, some withdrew and it wasn’t healthy.”</p>\n<p>Capps said her husband Walter started teaching the course during a time of tension caused by the negative public reactions toward the war.</p>\n<p>“There was an era of time when he had to walk through smoke in Isla Vista to get to class. The Bank of America burned. It was wild. It was violent. The country tore itself apart over this war,” Capps said. “And who were the victims? The soldiers. The people who had nothing to do with causing it or the impact that it had on society.”</p>\n<p>McGrath is currently a volunteer at the Veterans Treatment Court in Santa Maria, California. She described the conditions of the veterans that typically come in for help and what she does for them.</p>\n<p>“They’re still suffering … they have serious problems, they encounter the law,” McGrath said. “Rather than go to jail and serve time for no constructive reason, Judge Flores created the Veterans treatment court … in that court we get to see the PTSD … Times have changed and they get professional assessment.”</p>\n<p>McGrath recounted her time in the service, saying, “Out of 12 years of Catholic School with the Irish nuns, going into boot camp was a piece of cake.”</p>\n<p>US Navy Officer and third class dental technician Janice Summers discussed the progress of veterans today and the support system established to help other veterans.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them [veterans] are actually giving back,” Summers said. “Yes, it was a terrible time. Yes, I was spit on. Even after the riots … even after our barracks got raided on … you have to move forward. If you have a situation, you can never let it get the best of you.”</p>\n<p>Turner said veterans need the help of the public and of those around them to overcome their traumatic experiences.</p>\n<p>“I ask you to remember us and to help support us — not financially, because most of us don’t want nothing. There’s nothing you can give me,” Turner said. “But to support us with love, dignity and compassion that we’re entitled to, that we picked up arms to do for you.”</p>\n<p>Veteran Wilson said he still suffered as a veteran of the Vietnam War through a form of unique cancer caused by exposure to the warfare herbicide, Agent Orange.</p>\n<p>“I was killed in Vietnam, I just haven’t fallen yet,” Wilson said.</p>\n<p>At the end of the discussion, Representative Capps was given a coin in celebration of American women in military service.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68333\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68333\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/","id":2530,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[2529,2528,2527],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Students, Faculty Discuss ISIS and Refugees","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Juergensmeyer_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Juergensmeyer_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Professor Mark Juergensmeyer, Director of the Orfalea Center for Global and International Studies, spoke to students and faculty Tuesday evening at Carrillo Dining Commons about the rise of both the I...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Professor Mark Juergensmeyer, Director of the Orfalea Center for Global and International Studies, spoke to students and faculty Tuesday evening at Carrillo Dining Commons about the rise of both the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Islamophobia in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The discussion, part of UCSB’s Faculty Nights series, served as a forum for students and staff with different perspectives to engage in conversation about the conflict in Iraq, the Syrian Civil War and the resulting refugee crisis.

According to a 2015 report, the United Nations believes ISIS is holding over 3,500 people as slaves and is responsible for the displacement and deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer opened the talk by discussing his recent experience interviewing refugees in Erbil, Iraq who were fleeing ISIS, which he said opened his perspective on what ISIS is and who is supporting it.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer recounted the tale of a refugee policeman whose cousin had joined simply because he was making more money than if he was fighting in the Iraqi army.</p>\n<p>According to Juergensmeyer, the November terrorist attacks in Paris were a way for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi “to show others that the war is real.”</p>\n<p>“He [al-Baghdadi] can go to Paris and put on a pretend war, and suddenly, he’s back in the headlines,” Juergensmeyer said.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer said for al-Baghdadi, recruiting foreigners to fight for ISIS in Iraq and Syria has been an effective strategy.</p>\n<p>“Al-Baghdadi is bringing them there as an intimidation force so that he can control the Sunnis in the region from rebelling and turning against him,” Juergensmeyer said.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer said although it is still present and dangerous threat, ISIS has recently lost momentum.</p>\n<p>“Not only did ISIS lose territory in 2015, but young people are fleeing from ISIS in droves,” Juergensmeyer said.</p>\n<p>Max Peck, third-year communication major and veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, works at UCSB’s Veteran Resource Center and helped organize the event. Peck said the event aimed to shed light on the veteran community at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“One of my goals while I’m here is to make our community more visible, and I view this as a really good way to make us more visible, not only to faculty, but to students at UCSB,” Peck said.</p>\n<p>First-year global studies major Charlie Wang said he took a global studies course with Juergensmeyer and considers him an authority on the issue of global terrorism.</p>\n<p>“Professor Juergensmeyer was very knowledgeable about different issues going on around the world, especially ISIS,” Wang said. “It was also very interesting to hear all the different perspectives from the different professors in different departments.”</p>\n<p>Second-year global studies major Nathan Garrido said he attended the event in pursuit of information on ISIS and its global influence.</p>\n<p>“The topic that was discussed is super relevant right now — it’s not a conversation that has been going on long enough and we have not had enough people involved,” Garrido said. “It was a great way to get faculty to interact with students and have this open discussion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/","id":2531,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2530,2529,2528],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ex-Student Pleads Not Guilty in 2014 Campus Rape","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02162016-Daniel-Jiang-Chen-06.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02162016-Daniel-Jiang-Chen-06.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A former UC Santa Barbara student accused of raping a woman on campus in 2014 pleaded not guilty to two felony rape charges Tuesday and will continue to be held without bail.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former UC Santa Barbara student accused of raping a woman on campus in 2014 pleaded not guilty to two felony rape charges Tuesday and will continue to be</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held without bail.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel J.

Rhymefest—a rapper, songwriter and politician—will now be performing at 4 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB said in a statement that the conference will end with the unveiling of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ80BCbcCG0\" target=\"_blank\">historical mural</a> at North Hall documenting the day, in 1968, when black students <a href=\"http://www.blackstudies.ucsb.edu/1968/el_gaucho_1968.html\" target=\"_blank\">took over</a> North Hall. The students, in October 1968, covered the building’s name with a sign reading “Malcolm X Hall” and demanded an increase in black student enrollment and representation. The takeover ultimately led to the establishment of UCSB’s Department of Black Studies.</span></p>\n<p>Anthony Williams, editor-in-chief of ABC and a student at UC Berkeley, said the conference is “a show of blackness at a place like UCSB where black students might feel isolated.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s good to have a weekend where [students] can be supported, be black and be proud,” Williams said. “As an organization that represents black students all over California, we want to build solidarity across each other and across the diaspora.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2014-2015 academic year, black students comprised just under four percent of the undergraduate and graduate population at UCSB.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68203\" style=\"width: 348px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68203\" data-attachment-id=\"68203\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-13/ucsb-hosts-12th-annual-afrikan-black-coalition-conference/2007-abc-conference-ucsb/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2007-ABC-Conference-UCSB.jpg?fit=360%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"360,238\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ABC Conference 2007 UCSB\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2007-ABC-Conference-UCSB.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2007-ABC-Conference-UCSB.jpg?fit=360%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68203\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2007-ABC-Conference-UCSB.jpg?resize=338%2C223\" alt=\"The Afrikan Black Coalition Conference at UCSB in 2007 (via UCSB Center for Black Studies Research)\" width=\"338\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2007-ABC-Conference-UCSB.jpg?w=360&amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2007-ABC-Conference-UCSB.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68203\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Afrikan Black Coalition Conference at UCSB in 2007 <em>(via UCSB Center for Black Studies Research)</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Planting the seeds of our future, defining our next steps” is the theme of this year’s conference, and Williams said one of the primary goals is “to hear from students the issues directly affecting them. We want to hear how, as an organization, we can help.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By Monday, they should have a greater commitment to ABC, a greater sense of self and a greater sense of community,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, associate dean of student life and the coalition’s primary advisor at UCSB, said in a release that UCSB students worked hard to prepare for the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UCSB ABC committee has been working tirelessly to create an experience to remember by focusing on a program that builds community, educates and celebrates the contributions of Black leaders,” Armistead said in the release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In December, the University of California <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/uc-divests-from-private-prisons-after-pressure-from-black-student-unions/\" target=\"_blank\">sold off approximately $25 million that it had invested in private prisons</a> after pressure from ABC and Black Student Unions across the UC system.</span></p>\n<p>Blake Simons, deputy communications director of ABC and a student at UC Berkeley, said the push for UC to divest from prisons was part of “a rebirth of black power activism on campuses” throughout the country, and that it brought “national attention to what black students are doing and what they are capable of.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Folks who may not have known about us before are very aware of us now and are trying to help out any way they can,” Williams said. “That has helped our students to see how amazing we can be as black organizers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s definitely a momentum, and that is a beautiful thing,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow the conference on Twitter using the hashtag #ABC2K16.</span></i></p><div

Senate voted to fully fund the request.</p>\n<p>Brandon Morse, President of Young Americans for Liberty and fourth-year political science major, called for a resolution protecting free speech rights.</p>\n<p>Morse said there have been recent threats made against him as President of Young Americans for Liberty and Jason Garshfield, vice-president and fourth-year political science major.</p>\n<p>“We have students on this campus threatening members of my club with stabbing them because they’re exercising their First Amendment right,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Morse said the Graduate Student Association’s (GSA) statement of solidarity, which condemned hate speech, was not based on factual evidence and used inappropriate language.</p>\n<p>“With all respect to the GSA and the fallacious points of view they have presented to this campus, they have no rationality for anything they’re saying,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Morse said making a threat to anyone, regardless of the intention of carrying it out, is a crime that should be taken seriously regardless of that person’s identity.</p>\n<p>“If I or any member of my club were to make that same comment to somebody else, there would be an uproar on our campus,” Morse said. “I think this type of language is ridiculous and especially having the Graduate Student Association come in with nothing but rhetoric and attack someone exercising their First Amendment right is ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said attacks against people exercising their First Amendment rights will not improve if the senate does not take legislative action.</p>\n<p>“As long as we do not pass resolutions supporting free speech, incidents like this will continue to happen because A.S. will not have taken a stance,” Garshfield said. “I think the events over the last several weeks prove the necessity of a resolution.”</p>\n<p>Marjan Kris, (S.C.O.R.E.) representative and second-year history of public policy and environmental studies double major gave a quarterly report about the success of their recent Environmental Racism and Environmental Justice Workshop.</p>\n<p>Kris said resolutions to create committees to hire senators makes him “extremely” uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>“Some of the same senators that were involved in the controversial process of picking recently appointed senators are either chairing or vice-chairing these committees,” Kris said. “These are the same senators who are currently being investigated for potentially violating legal code.”</p>\n<p>Kris said the process will not adequately reflect students’ voice in student government.</p>\n<p>“It does not reflect democratic process. It makes students who want to participate in A.S. shy away from it.”</p>\n<p>Kris said if the resolution regarding the committees passes, various student groups and Office of Student Life (OSL) organizations will release a statement of no confidence toward the senate.</p>\n<p>Representing Environmental Affairs Board, Nick Frey, third-year computer science and environmental studies double major, said the university needs the Formal Office of Sustainability to achieve UCSB’s green environment goals over the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>“We believe that a Formal Office of Sustainability is necessary if we want to achieve our campus goals of being carbon-free by 2020 and waste-free by 2025,” Frey said. “All the other UCs have a similar office, so I believe it’s something overdue for our campus.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate voted 16-0-1 to create a Formal Office of Sustainability</p>\n<p>Jerel Constantino, off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy major, introduced a resolution calling upon UCPD, Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department and California Highway Patrol to support the Iowa Stop.</p>\n<p>“This is a response to, I believe, Paula coming to senate in her weekly report saying that UCPD was going to begin a crackdown on bicycles running stop signs,” Constantino said, “However, research shows that it’s less safe for bicycles to stop.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate sent the resolution to External Affairs.</p>\n<p>A.S. Womyn’s Commission requested $2,050 for an honorarium for Alexis Pauline Gumbs as a speaker for their Annual Womyn of Color Conference, a request A.S. Finance and Business Committee (A.S. F&amp;B) tabled indefinitely on Monday.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate also voted on Senator Alejandra Melgoza retaining her off-campus senator position despite moving into university housing. In a 11-1-5 vote, A.S. voted for Senator Melgoza to retain her position.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68189\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-12/a-s-senate-discusses-free-speech-issues-creation-of-new-offices/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68189\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-12/a-s-senate-discusses-free-speech-issues-creation-of-new-offices/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-12/a-s-senate-discusses-free-speech-issues-creation-of-new-offices/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-12/a-s-senate-discusses-free-speech-issues-creation-of-new-offices/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-12/a-s-senate-discusses-free-speech-issues-creation-of-new-offices/","id":2553,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2552,2551,2550],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"District Supervisor Candidates Share Platforms","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Bruce-Porter-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Bruce-Porter-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor candidates spoke with the Nexus this week to share their platforms for Isla Vista and the county.

He currently works as president of the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District School Board, chairman of the Santa Ynez Valley Youth Coalition and Edward Jones financial advisor.</p>\n<p>Porter announced in late January his plan to initiate an Economic Prosperity Corridor should he be elected as supervisor. According to Porter, most of the tech firms in Santa Barbara County are located in Goleta, which he said forces workers to commute on the 101 from their homes in the rest of the county.</p>\n<p>“As I’ve met with officials at UCSB, I’ve learned of a wave of new companies and new technologies that will be spinning out of research at UCSB, and in the past a lot of those just went into Goleta,” Porter said. “Goleta is pretty well built-out now.”</p>\n<p>His plan with the Economic Prosperity Corridor is to encourage businesses to “set up shop” in areas like Buellton, Lompoc and Santa Maria to reduce the number of freeway commuters. According to Porter, this initiative will help to reduce pollution, preserve infrastructure and allow UCSB grads to stay in the Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Let’s move those new businesses out into other parts of the county where they’ll be closer to the people who actually work there,” Porter said. “That would be keeping all these great businesses in the county.”</p>\n<p>As for the county’s involvement in I.V., Porter said he hopes to be a leader and a “champion” for getting the Community Services District (CSD) proposal passed in November. He said the ultimate goal for I.V. is cityhood.</p>\n<p>“In the long range, the goal is cityhood for Isla Vista, if that’s what the residents want. The CSD is sort of a tiny little step to that eventual goal,” Porter said. “[I want to help] shape the whole process over time so that we continue the path to full cityhood.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68106\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68106\" data-attachment-id=\"68106\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/supervisor-joan-hartmann-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=1375%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1375,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Supervisor Joan Hartmann\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68106 \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1-704x1024.jpg?resize=296%2C431\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Joanhartmannforsupervisor.org\" width=\"296\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?w=1375&amp;ssl=1 1375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Joanhartmannforsupervisor.org</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Planning Commissioner Joan Hartmann declared candidacy in early January in hopes to “continue and build on” the role of her soon-to-retire employer, Farr.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s career began in academia when she earned a Ph.D. in Government from Claremont Graduate School, where she was appointed as the first female faculty member and director of the Public Policy Program. She also served on the faculty at Oberlin College and later served as adjunct professor at USC. She currently serves on the Santa Barbara Foundation’s LEAF Advisory Committee and the Wilding Museum’s Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>According to Hartmann, the platform of her bid for supervisor is “enhancing the quality of life that we cherish in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p>“I think Doreen Farr has done a really good job connecting people to county resources, and her staff has worked hard to provide good, strong constituency services,” Hartmann said. “I would like to build on that.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said one of the issues she hopes to address is economic vitality in the county. She said she hopes to increase cooperation between the private and public sectors, following the models laid out by Ventura County, San Luis Obispo County and Sonoma County.</p>\n<p>“The question is, ‘What do we want in Santa Barbara County?’” Hartmann said. “I would like the county to help bring the various entities together and hear that out in a more deliberate way.”</p>\n<p>As for the county’s involvement in I.V. and the University, Hartmann said she wants to take on a similar role as Farr in regularly meeting with residents and university officials.</p>\n<p>“I think Doreen and her staff have worked very hard to participate in the various working groups and committees in Isla Vista, and I would certainly continue that,” Hartmann said. “I know she also meets regularly with UCSB representatives and tries to find ways that they can work together on issues. I would want to continue that and build on it.”</p>\n<p>Should I.V. residents approve a CSD in November, Hartmann said she would be supportive but yielding to the needs of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“If there is a CSD, I think that is something I would support,” Hartmann said. “As a supervisor, I think it’s really something that is controlled largely by the community. I think that’s the whole point.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68105\" style=\"width: 323px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68105\" data-attachment-id=\"68105\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/supervisor-jay-freeman-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=1375%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1375,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Supervisor Jay Freeman-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68105 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1-704x1024.jpg?resize=313%2C456\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Cult of Mac\" width=\"313\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?w=1375&amp;ssl=1 1375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Cult of Mac</p></div>\n<p>Sixteen-year I.V. resident Jay Freeman declared candidacy late January in order to fill a role where he said he seems to be needed.</p>\n<p>Freeman grew up in Chicago and came to UCSB in 1999 to study computer science. He is the founder of the multimillion-dollar software company Cydia, an app that allows users to customize jailbroken Apple devices. Freeman currently serves as vice president of the Isla Vista Downtown Business Association and is an active member of the Isla Vista Self-Governance Initiative.</p>\n<p>As for Freeman’s involvement in the supervisor race, Freeman said he has “kind of fallen into this” — he believes the county’s board of supervisors is a place that has shown a need for him.</p>\n<p>“I’m not a career politician in the sense that I want to rise through the ranks,” Freeman said. “I want essentially to be the man in the field who’s actually trying to figure out how to make practical solutions to real world problems, as opposed to sitting back and doing legislation.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, the county needs to be more proactive in serving its residents.<br>\n“The county just allows problems to occur, then waits for people to complain about them and then tries to quell the uprising,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said one of the issues he hopes to address as supervisor is the lack of interaction between I.V. residents and county officials. According to Freeman, it is inadequate that state assemblymember Das Williams has had to host meetings to foster communication between I.V. and the county.</p>\n<p>“It’s slightly awkward that we’ve had to have our state assemblymember run meetings that are almost mediating between the people of Isla Vista and the county,” Freeman said. “That’s the kind of meeting that I would have expected that the county would have been setting up.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he wants to be a county supervisor that is actively involved in local meetings in the county’s unincorporated areas.</p>\n<p>“I actually want to try to sit down in various local meetings and try to come up with compromises between bringing people together,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, I.V. cannot attain the full benefits of a CSD unless the county “steps up” and institutes a Municipal Advisory Council or an Area Planning Commission.</p>\n<p>“With a Community Services District, one of the powers that it can have is to fund a Municipal Advisory Council, but it doesn’t have the power to make a Municipal Advisory Council,” Freeman said. “The county has to support that.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

One of the suspects was allegedly armed with a souvenir baseball bat, according to the Santa Barbara Sherrif’s Office (SBSO). During the course of the robbery, one male victim sustained a black eye and another male victim broke his hand. Within the same night, SBSO identified a female driver of the getaway vehicle as first-year student Breanna Kromer, 18, and she was taken into police custody after a traffic stop on Embarcadero Del Mar. Kromer was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of robbery, resisting arrest and conspiracy. Public Information Officer for SBSO Kelly Hoover said one of the suspects was familiar with a resident at the location, and the incident “wasn’t a random crime.”</p>\n<p>Garcia was arrested the next day and booked into the jail on charges of first degree robbery and criminal conspiracy.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 31, SBSO arrested White and the 17-year-old male after receiving an anonymous tip about their location at a residence on the 900 block of Camino Lindo. SBSO, along with I.V. Foot Patrol, attempted to contact the suspects, but the suspects refused to comply. UCPD officers set up a perimeter and contained the area. After entering the residence with the K-9 Unit, the officers were able to arrest and book White and the 17-year-old for robbery, conspiracy and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p>White is still in police custody and is being held on $100,000 bail, according to SBSO. The juvenile was released with pending charges.</p>\n<p>Garcia is currently on a conditional own recognizance release (OR). Benjamin T. Ladinig, chief prosecutor for the case, said the court released Garcia on OR due to the recommendation of the Santa Barbara County Jail conditional own recognizance release/bail release (OR/BR) unit.</p>\n<p>According to the OR/BR report by the Santa Barbara County Superior Court, SBSO arresting officer said Garcia “made threats against the victim during jail phone calls.” Prior to Garcia’s release, alleged victims one and two provided similar input, with victim two saying he feared Garcia may return to the residence to retaliate.</p>\n<p>As references in the report, Garcia’s parents described her as “a good kid, trustworthy and very responsible,” adding they were unaware of Garcia having any issues involving alcohol or drugs. The references also expressed certainty that Garcia would appear in court and abide by conditions of release.</p>\n<p>Kromer’s bail was posted at $100,000, but Judge Clifford Anderson reduced it to $50,000 after the pretrial. Kromer posted bail and was released. Kromer was denied an own recognizance release “due to lack of reference input and unverified personal information,” according to the OR/BR report.</p>\n<p>Kromer’s father said in the report that she had “control” issues with alcohol and she “periodically uses marijuana.” Kromer’s mother cited past alcohol and drug use, not including current usage, and said the subject is in need of counseling. Kromer’s mother described her as “dependable, loyal and responsible” but said she is not currently taking her medication and is “headed down a bad path.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Santa Barbara Independent</em> <a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2016/feb/08/three-arrested-alleged-iv-baseball-bat-robbery/\">reported</a> that in court Monday, public defense attorney Mark Owens claimed Kromer received no medications during her time in jail. In response, Hoover said “there are several procedures in place when an inmate is booked at the jail and at no time was there ever any indication that there was medication that was prescribed to her. The first time the jail knew of this issue was during court.”</p>\n<p>The University was unable to provide a comment regarding the academic status of the students after the incident.</p>\n<p>Hoover said there is a possibility that drug involvement is a factor in the motivation for the robbery, but the case is under investigation.</p>\n<p>The preliminary hearing for Garcia, Kromer and White will be held Feb. 24 at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>*This article has been updated from its original form to protect the privacy of a subject of this article</em><em>.</em></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-68110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Black South African activists Jamie Mithi and Khanyisa Pinini discussed their views on labeling Israel an apartheid state in an event hosted by Gauchos United for Israel on Tuesday in the Isla Vista Theater.</p>\n<p>Mithi, originally from Zimbabwe, is an author and law student at University of the Witwatersrand Johannesburg. He is an avid debater, ranked fourth globally and first in Africa in the World Universities Public Speaking Championship. Pinini, originally from Johannesburg, has been heavily involved with student leadership at University of Cape Town (UCT) and is a member of the United Nations Association of South Africa: UCT Chapter and has participated two times in national Model United Nations conferences.</p>\n<p>Mithi and Pinini both shared their personal experiences with apartheid in South Africa and how their own narratives informed their definitions of the term “apartheid.” Both said they used to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement, but withdrew their support after visiting Israel. The two speakers said they have felt a loss of Black South African apartheid narrative due to the use of the term to label Israel when referring to conflict with Palestine.</p>\n<p>Mithi first proposed that a major difference between an apartheid state and the status of Israel is historical context. In the context of debate, he presented the claim that Israel is a colonial-settler state, then refuted this idea by stating there cannot be a colonial-settler state if said settlers already existed within an area.</p>\n<p>“It is a non sequitur for us to claim that people who have always had a presence in a particular area, are colonizers of the area if they’ve always been there,” Mithi said.</p>\n<p>The second level of Mithi’s argument focused on the legislative structure of apartheid versus that of the state of Israel. He said apartheid law’s “four levels of existence,” which are based upon racial discrimination, are “just not the way it is” in Israel’s legal system.</p>\n<p>“In Israel, all Israeli citizens have the same rights,” Mithi said.</p>\n<p>This difference in citizen rights is what he argues sets apartheid and the Israeli state apart.</p>\n<p>His third level of debate focused on the context of the area. He said conflicts in the surrounding areas of Israel are what “led to the conflicts in the West Bank.” This war-zone environment is another factor, according to Mithi, that sets true apartheid apart from the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>\n<p>“It would be complete false argumentation and academically insincere to say that’s apartheid,” Mithi said. “The reality is, what I’m talking about, the scenario of ‘peaceful neighbor,’ where I’m talking about a scenario where the neighbors aren’t seeing eye to eye, right?”</p>\n<p>In his closing statement, Mithi said when discussing Israel-Palestine conflict, neither side should vilify the other.</p>\n<p>“There is a problem in Israel [and] Palestine, and largely in the Middle East. And I don’t think that the tactic of demonizing the other side leads to the relevant solution,” Mithi said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68109\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68109\" data-attachment-id=\"68109\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/activists-discuss-israel-apartheid-state-label/apartheid_by-spencer-brandt-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Apartheid_by Spencer Brandt-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68109\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Michelle May, a second-year biology major, said she was impressed by Mithi and Pinini’s expertise.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t come here expecting anything, I found it really interesting to hear [about the conflict] from a South African point of view, coming from a family that has experienced apartheid,” May said. “And they’re obviously really educated about both topics.”</p>\n<p>Event organizer Kayla Shenassa, a second-year classics major, said the event exceeded her expectations.</p>\n<p>“It was really great to see the number of people that came out to an event like this.

A California Highway Patrol car was parked on the side of the street, but Waltman didn’t think twice about breezing through the intersection on his bicycle.</p>\n<p>“There were no cars on the road and it was 9 a.m.,” said Waltman, a UCSB alumnus. “I slowed down and didn’t stop. I’ve done that plenty of times in front of a cop.”</p>\n<p>Moments later, the patrol car’s lights flashed on and an officer cited Waltman for failing to stop — a $270 fine for the first offense, according to the Santa Barbara Police Department.</p>\n<p>“‘We are cracking down on it to hopefully make you guys more safe,’” Waltman recalled the officer saying. As Waltman pedaled away from the curb, he saw the officer pull over another bicyclist for running the same stop sign.</p>\n<p>While Waltman and other Isla Vistans say there has been an increase in citations for bike offenses, Officer John Gutierrez of the Santa Barbara Police Department said there is no effort by highway patrol officers to write more tickets.</p>\n<p>“We’re not told to go out there and write up bicyclists — not at all,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>The police department will be hosting a bike safety event on March 2 at the Pardall Center, after which, Gutierrez said, there may be a “ramped up increase” in citations.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez pointed to recent bike accidents in I.V., including a two-bike collision on Pardall Road <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/692109191822049280\">in January</a> that sent one person to the hospital, as evidence of the need for bicyclists to follow traffic signs.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people are riding bicycles unsafely in I.V.,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Wednesday night, Associated Students senators voted to send a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bike-Law-Resolution.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> resolution</a> to External Affairs Committee that calls on campus police, the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office and California Highway Patrol “to allow bicycles to treat stop signs and red lights as yield signs.” The resolution will now head to A.S. External Affairs.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Jerel Constantino, who drafted the bill, said because so many students already ignore the bike laws, the bill is designed “to keep the status quo.”</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, third-year history of public policy major and College of Letters &amp; Sciences collegiate senator, said Isla Vista Foot Patrol regulates bicycle and skateboard laws inconsistently.</p>\n<p>“The crackdown on bicyclists is unreasonable, because I.V.F.P. will be very strict on biking rules . . . and then will disappear,” Minoiefar said. “I don’t think the crackdown is about safety, because the rules are not enforced consistently.”</p>\n<p>The resolution refers to a 1982 Idaho statute known as the “Idaho stop,” which allows bicyclists to roll through stop signs, after looking both ways, and to bike under red lights after stopping.</p>\n<p>“The Idaho stop is not saying you see a stop sign and you ignore it,” Constantino said. “When you see a stop sign, that should be a key to look both left and right and, if necessary, stop.”</p>\n<p>Constantino, third-year history of public policy and political science double major, said he bikes to campus from I.V. every day and drafted the bill to protect bicyclists “from a misguided prioritization of law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also calls for the California State Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown to institute a similar law statewide.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Waltman was cited, he posted a picture of his ticket on a popular UCSB Facebook group, warning other bicyclists that officers were enforcing the law.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, he was at the center of a spirited debate in the comment section about whether police should ticket bicyclists for failing to obey traffic signs.</p>\n<p>While some commenters assumed Waltman disagreed with being cited, he said he “totally deserved” the ticket.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s a little inconvenient to stop and go on a rusty old mountain bike, but when you have a culture where nobody stops and people just throw themselves into intersections, it’s dangerous,” Waltman said.</p>\n<p>Elena Rovito, fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she often bikes to class and to restaurants in I.V. Rovito said she always follows the traffic signs, but when she walks, she has to be aware of bicyclists who are not following the law.</p>\n<p>“You have to constantly be on your toes,” Rovito said. “You’ll see people biking, not looking both ways, texting, and I’ve had to jump out of the way on more than one occasion.”</p>\n<p>Sarah Garrett, first-year political science major and copy reader at the Daily Nexus, was ticketed recently for failing to stop at the corner of Camino Pescadero and Trigo Road. Garrett said she plans to enroll in a bike safety course to reduce her fine.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think anything of it because, a couple days before, I had blown through a stop sign by a cop and nothing had happened,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>The officer told Garrett that he was trying to keep her and other bicyclists safe, but she said stopping at some intersections can be more dangerous than passing slowly through.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be more of a hazard to stop at certain stop signs because no one is stopping and I feel like herds of bikes might run over me,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>Garrett now tries to avoid biking through I.V. by staying on El Colegio Road for as long as possible. When she has to bike through I.V., though, she said she stops at every stop sign to avoid another ticket — or at least slows down and puts her foot on the ground.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this story said the bike resolution had passed Student Senate. The bike resolution was revised and sent to External Affairs, passed, and sent back to Senate where it awaits final approval.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Chen was transferred to Santa Barbara County Jail on Wednesday, about a week after university police learned of the DNA match, Romero said.</p>\n<p>The victim filed a personal injury <strong><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/lawsuit-claims-dangerous-area-of-ucsb-led-to-rape/\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a></strong> in January alleging, among other claims, that the UCSB Police Department was “understaffed and insufficiently trained” to investigate the case.</p>\n<p>Tyrone Maho, one of two attorneys representing the victim, said Thursday that his client was “relieved” to hear about the arrest.</p>\n<p>“Our client was really pleased that this developed,” Maho said. “I’m just hoping it leads to the location and the prosecution of any other assailants involved.”</p>\n<p>Romero said that while the DNA match was a lucky break, UCPD has continued to investigate the case since 2014.</p>\n<p>“Yes, we were fortunate from the DNA hit, but we were never not motivated to solve this case,” Romero said Thursday. “We do know there’s a lawsuit out there but we’ve just been grinding and chipping away at this case.”</p>\n<p>In its statement, UCSB said, “We deeply appreciate the multiagency search that led to the uncovering and collection of DNA evidence, which has now resulted in the arrest of a suspect. This is a crucial step toward achieving justice and preventing future tragedies.”</p>\n<p>The university said that while the arrest is a step forward, “it may bring renewed pain to our student and her family.”</p>\n<p>“We keep them in our thoughts, as we have for the past two years, and we continue to offer our unwavering support and heartfelt sympathy.”</p>\n<p>Chen is currently being held without bail in Santa Barbara County Jail. He will be arraigned Feb. 16 in Santa Barbara Superior Court.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68186\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68186\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/","id":2585,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[2584,2583,2582],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":98,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
