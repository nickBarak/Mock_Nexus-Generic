400;\">A resolution to divest from companies that profit from alleged human rights violations in Israel and Palestine did not come to a vote at the Associated Students Senate meeting on Wednesday after 12 senators left — and never came back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The controversial “divestment” resolution was brought to the table for the fifth time in six years on Wednesday, but 12 senators and proxies didn’t return to the over 10-hour-long meeting after a brief recess.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators disagreed on a specific element of the resolution, one that would have altered the number of “yes” votes needed for the resolution to pass. Following a prolonged standoff that divided the Senate nearly in half, the meeting abruptly ended just after 5:00 a.m., when Internal Vice President (IVP) Jasmine Sandhu announced that there were no longer enough senators to vote on the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our constituents were still here when people decided to leave,” Senator Grecia Martinez told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the meeting. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83178\" style=\"width: 682px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83178\" data-attachment-id=\"83178\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/divestment3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?fit=672%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"672,480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"divestment3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?fit=672%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83178 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?resize=672%2C480\" alt=\"\" width=\"672\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?w=672&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83178\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some of the senators sent proxies, or substitutes, to attend Wednesday’s meeting. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution calls on UC Santa Barbara, the A.S. Investment Advisory Committee, the UC Treasury and the UC Regents to withdraw investments from companies “that provide military support to the occupation of Palestinian territories.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in companies like General Electric, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which sell military equipment to Israel, shows “implicit support” for the killing of Palestinian civilians, the resolution states.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eighty-nine speakers took the podium at public forum on Wednesday, the vast majority of them speaking about the issue of divestment and the Israel-Palestine conflict at large. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the Senate never got to an actual discussion about the conflict. Instead, the senators fell into a disagreement after Ali Suebert, the A.S. attorney general, told the Senate at public forum that the resolution would be a “positional” and not “directional” piece of legislation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positional resolution “endorses, sponsors, or supports a group’s actions or events,” according to A.S. Legal Code. Typically, the Senate uses these resolutions to adopt an official stance on an issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A directional resolution, meanwhile, “directs members of A.S. Personnel, Boards, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committees, and/or the Senate to specific duties” and usually moves to create an actual effect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suebert pointed to individual parts of the resolution’s language, including a phrase about companies “profiting from human rights violations,” to justify her judgment that the resolution called for adopting a position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key difference between the two comes down to voting thresholds. While a positional resolution needs a two-thirds majority to pass, a directional resolution needs only a 50 percent plus one vote majority to be approved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That margin mattered to the divestment vote. Throughout the night, various votes to move the meeting forward stalled at 13-12. As a result, the Senate wound up discussing only the nature of the resolution itself and not its contents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, 13 senators did not want to approve the agenda, which would have codified the resolution as positional. Seeing that they wouldn’t budge, the other 12 senators did not come back from a recess, which forced an early end to the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Brandon Mora and Vanessa Maldonado co-authored the resolution, and students Naia Al-Anbar and Edan Tessema co-sponsored it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was intended to be directional, Maldonado said at the meeting. She emphasized she and Mora did not want the Senate to assume a position on the political or moral issue at the core of divestment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copies of the resolution provided by A.S. at the meeting stated that the resolution was directional. Sandhu, who chairs the Senate and has the authority to adjust resolutions, later changed it to be positional. Suebert, the A.S. attorney general, deemed it both directional and positional when she spoke at public forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution will now be pushed either to next week’s meeting, an emergency meeting or an email vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Alexandra Gessesse and third-year global studies major Justice Dumlao, who substituted for Sophia Uemura, cited language used in past directional resolutions, such as a resolution to support last week’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/afscme-strike-comes-to-an-end-a-s-passes-resolution-in-support/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as having set a precedent for how directional resolutions should be written. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, you see the senators that came back to the table willing to have the conversation that was necessary to make sure the authors got due diligence, that the communities got due diligence and both sides on UCSB’s campus and all students involved got due diligence,” Gessesse told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gessesse added that she felt the walkout disrespected Sandhu as the Senate chair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was disappointing to see people who I would think are committed to this campus, especially in terms of their commitments next year, to not be committed to working through student issues when I’m obviously committed to working on these student issues,” Dumlao said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators who were approached for comment after walking out of the meeting asked to be contacted later in the day on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Mineiro, Sanya Kamidi and Maura Fox contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of the graphic in this story listed Adnan Mansur as Sami Kaayal’s proxy.

I would do it again if I could.”</p>\n<p>Le, who ran with Campus United during 2017 Spring Quarter elections, was elected over his Isla Vista Party opponent Nawar Nemeh and became UCSB’s first transfer student president.</p>\n<p>“I think having someone who isn’t shy to stray away from conventional norms was a very positive thing in terms of being a transfer,” Le said. “I think having a fresh, innovative perspective [is good] as someone who hasn’t been bogged down by the politics of A.S.”</p>\n<p>He ran on a platform of lowering student fees, “reclaiming” higher education by focusing on college affordability, creating student-owned businesses and “opening up” A.S. to historically marginalized communities.</p>\n<p>Throughout the one-year term of his presidency, he was effective in tackling issues involving sexual assault, addressing college affordability and opening up A.S.; however, he fell short on creating student businesses and working to lower student fees.</p>\n<p>Le addressed his first platform item, tackling college affordability, in part due to his work as a delegate within the California Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>“Being a delegate to the California Democratic Party put me in a unique position to address [college affordability] first hand,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Le said the position allowed him and UCSB Lobby Corps to successfully address college affordability, particularly food insecurity.</p>\n<p>“We had brought forth the concept of food insecurity, which at that time was kind of a new concept, and we had told [Monique Limon] that 48 percent of UCSB students were food insecure,” he said. “Subsequently, after her term began in 2017… she introduced legislation on our behalf.”</p>\n<p>He explained the bill “ended up becoming multiple different things” but eventually <a href=\"http://ahed.assembly.ca.gov/sites/ahed.assembly.ca.gov/files/hearings/AB%20453%20analysis%202017.pdf\">Assembly Bill 453</a>, which was adopted into the state budget, resulted in $3.5 million in state funds that would be used to address food insecurity system wide.</p>\n<p>UCSB received $250,000 of that money, according to Le.</p>\n<p>He explained that the Democratic Party adopted “the most progressive party platform in the country,” which included having tuition-free colleges.</p>\n<p>“I was proud and fortunate to be a co-sponsor for that resolution,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Le said he and Lobby Corps lobbied against the proposed UC Regents tuition hikes, when the regents proposed another tuition increase.</p>\n<p>Since the year 2000, 90,000 students have been enrolled systemwide, but UC still receives the <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/support-uc/ucan/state-budget\">same level of funding</a>, according to the UC website.</p>\n<p>In mid-march, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\">raised out-of-state tuition</a> and postponed the vote on in-state tuition following backlash.</p>\n<p>While not an item on his platform, Le said he is proud of “protecting the health and safety of students” during the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a> by asking UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang to delay Fall Quarter final exams.</p>\n<p>When the Thomas Fire first hit the Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties during early December, Yang initially said the Fall Quarter would continue as scheduled.</p>\n<p>However, following several power outages and “hazardous” air quality, Le “pushed back against faculty who did not want to be inconvenienced” and met with Yang to discuss <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\">moving finals.</a></p>\n<p>Le said he sent an email to Yang, asking him to cancel finals and classes, and Yang had responded asking to meet.</p>\n<p>“[He] wanted to hear what my consultation was, in terms of what the student body needs,” Le said. “I told him, as I stated in my letter, that classes needed to be canceled, and finals need to be canceled, and that is what happened… I remained firm in my belief in protecting the health and safety of the students.”</p>\n<p>Winter Quarter began a week later than initially scheduled and Fall Quarter finals took place the week of January 8.</p>\n<p>“Having test anxiety … in addition to horrible conditions, no student should ever go to school when it was that unsafe,” Le said.</p>\n<p>On women’s issues, particularly regarding sexual assault, the A.S. President’s office was involved in the creation of a UC-wide <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">Title IX student advisory board</a>, according to Le.</p>\n<p>The board is composed of one undergraduate student and one graduate student from each UC.</p>\n<p>Le said he, UC Title IX coordinator Kathleen Salvaty, UC Los Angeles student body president Arielle Mokhtarzadeh and several staff members from the UC Title IX office worked so students could have an opportunity for “real, substantial change.”</p>\n<p>“[We wanted] to be able to address many of the dangerous things that were happening federally, especially with the Title IX rollbacks from the Obama-era guidelines,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Salvaty <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/first-uc-system-wide-title-ix-coordinator-resigns/\">later resigned</a> in part due to the daily commute of the job and the board is currently working on potential amendments to the UC system-wide policy.</p>\n<p>While Le succeeded in several items on his platform, he failed to lower student fees and worked to raise them during Spring Quarter with the “NewCen” project.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/newcen-to-create-innovation-lab-pedestrian-path/\">project</a>, which involved an innovation lab, renovated food bank and a drastic remodel of the University Center, would have eventually increased student fees by close to $100 a quarter, a number that would rise due to inflation.</p>\n<p>It failed with 81.69 percent of students voting no on the A.S. Elections ballot, but not before the project became a source of controversy across campus.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t say there’s anything I would have done differently with the NewCen, but I would say that I still stand by my decision to push forth that measure,” Le said.</p>\n<p>He said his decision to push for the renovation was “in line with [his] campaign values” because the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/\">UCen</a> is a “dying building.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very shortsighted for students to be paying into a building right now that’s dying,” Le said. “The fact that the value of those dollars that would be spent on revitalizing is worth a lot more than what is currently being paid into a building.”</p>\n<p>To the point of addressing student-owned business, Le said he was unsuccessful with his promise of student-owned businesses, because this would have been addressed in the failed UCen proposal with the innovation lab.</p>\n<p>“We formulated a very comprehensive plan… to be able to give students the opportunity to go innovate, start their own business, and take their own ideas to the marketplace,” Le said. “We attempted, and that is just the way that democracy works.”</p>\n<p>Le’s successor, Campus United candidate Brooke Kopel, won by a narrow margin of 2.04 percent over her opponent Justice Dumlao, who ran with the Isla Vista Party.</p>\n<p>Kopel, a third-year political science and history double major, is currently on the A.S. Senate as a letters and science senator and was the first senate pro-tempore.</p>\n<p>Le praised Kopel’s capabilities and encouraged her to take time to do the things she loves outside of the job.</p>\n<p>“She’s gonna do a great job,” Le said. “One piece of advice I would say is try to enjoy your senior year as well.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The bill is Assembly Bill 453, not Assembly Bill 451, as previously stated.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-83146\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>While Jasmine Sandhu feels grateful for the opportunities she has had to participate within Associated Students, she said serving as the 2017-18 internal vice president was the most rewarding.</p>\n<p>“[The end of my term is] welcomed because I’m exhausted, but it feels great because I’m very proud of the work that I’ve accomplished,” Sandhu said. “I’m very proud of the work that I helped others accomplish, and I’m incredibly grateful for all the skills that I’ve gained, the experiences [and] the friends.”</p>\n<p>Sandhu was elected to the position of A.S. internal vice president (IVP) during the 2017 Spring Quarter Elections after running with Campus United (CU).</p>\n<p>She ran with the intent to streamline A.S. and improve communication between the Boards, Commissions and Units (BCUs) and the A.S. senators.</p>\n<p>Before serving as IVP, Sandhu served as a College of Letters &amp; Science senator within A.S. Senate. She also served as a student representative in the Internal Affairs Committee the year before.</p>\n<p>Early on in her term, Sandhu said she had to adjust her approach to the position after realizing the weight of her role as a resource to the 25 senators in A.S. as well as her own office staff. This involved connecting senators with the resources they needed and giving them guidance as they worked to pass legislation and accomplish their personal projects and goals.</p>\n<p>“I’d say my primary focus was really empowering the senators, and I feel like I did a pretty good job of doing that,” Sandhu said.</p>\n<p>When training senators, Sandhu said she focused more on logistics such as legislative procedure and how meetings ran.</p>\n<p>During the A.S. Senate retreat, she said she tailored senate trainings to include what was taught in previous years as well as tenets she believed were important to note as well.</p>\n<p>Sandhu said some senators mentioned they could have used more direction, but she said it was mostly from those who did not attend the retreat.</p>\n<p>“I think that I did a fairly good job,” Sandhu said. “I think they moved into the groove of being in senate faster than I’ve seen happen in the past.”</p>\n<p>IVP is required to plan and attend trainings during their term, such as the Safe Zone/Queer 101 training which must be completed by the sixth week of Fall Quarter, according to the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Sandhu said in years past, such trainings weren’t usually completed by week six due to students still settling into their positions. Sandhu was home very frequently this year and at times needed to postpone the trainings due to personal issues.</p>\n<p>“My mom got diagnosed with an illness so I had to be back pretty often,” Sandhu said. “Weekends that worked for me didn’t necessarily work for senators, so it was a lot of back and forth, and we just did not get to do that.”</p>\n<p>One of Sandhu’s goals at the beginning of her term was to increase accountability, specifically by publishing quarterly reports of how student fees were being spent. Sandhu’s intent with the quarterly reports, after speaking with her student fee advisory commissioner, was to create a “color-coded, user-friendly” website similar to that of UC Davis’s.</p>\n<p>However, the plan was halted after she received opposition from the Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p>Sandhu also expressed pride in the accountability of the senators this year, especially in their work with BCUs, saying that there have been a “lot of positive reviews” unlike in previous years.</p>\n<p>She credited her director of the legislative accountability, Greg Katz, as playing an important role in her ability to stay updated with the senators.</p>\n<p>“He was just a really good director of legislative accountability,” Sandhu said. “He went to their office hours weekly and made sure they were there and talked to them about what they needed and what projects they were working on and how he could help or I could help in any way, and then he would report back to me each week and let me know what they needed from me.”</p>\n<p>According to Sandhu, showing respect was an important part of making sure senators were completing their responsibilities and felt comfortable coming to her and Katz for help.</p>\n<p>“We weren’t here to just say you’re not doing your job but rather to make sure they had all the tools necessary to do their job,” Sandhu said.</p>\n<p>Regarding any projects she had planned but did not accomplish, Sandhu said she could have worked more on bridging the gap between the student body and A.S.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately most of my attention went to internal processes this year rather than bridging that gap, so I think I wish I could’ve done that more,” Sandhu said.</p>\n<p>One of Sandhu’s proudest moments this term was watching senators speak to each other after tense meetings. After one particular meeting wrought with high emotions and heavy subjects, Sandhu noted all the senators were “very sweet” to each other.</p>\n<p>“[Senate] has been very toxic in the past, so one thing I wanted to do this year was make sure that they knew they were all working toward the same goal of bettering the campus,” Sandhu said. “I don’t know if it was entirely me that went into play, but I think I did a fairly good job of maintaining that atmosphere, and they all took the initiative to continue to maintain that atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>Steven Ho, a second-year biology and Asian-American studies double major currently serving as an on-campus senator, will succeed Sandhu as IVP for the 2018-19 academic year.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-83140\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>When Batsheva Labowe-Stoll was elected external vice president for local affairs, her platform included issues regarding student rights, landlord issues, creating a community court and instituting a new parking system.</p>\n<p>While some of these plans fell through, Labowe-Stoll was able to implement other projects and focus her time on being a liason for UC Santa Barbara in Isla Vista and within the Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she had to put many projects on hold due to “day-to-day” issues in I.V. that frequently arose and required a majority of her attention.</p>\n<p>“I had planned out a very different year than what had happened, and it’s because I represent students to a living, breathing local community and it’s hard to plan when it comes to that, especially in a community so vibrant and alive as Isla Vista,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she was most proud of the Pause campaign and the Pause. town hall that occured at the beginning of winter quarter.</p>\n<p>The campaign focused on encouraging students to abstain from drug abuse during stressful times and to instead “pause” and try to understand their own mental health as well as their peers, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>She is hoping to implement the ideas brought up at the town hall and has already begun that process by working with UCSB Student Affairs and the Vice Chancellor’s office.</p>\n<p>“I spent a lot of time working on student well-being and mental health just because of the fires and mudslides,” Labowe-Stoll said. “That took up a lot of my year, in terms of trying to inform the faculty and staff at UCSB about why it was so difficult for us to go through winter quarter and deal with all of this on top of just the stresses of being a normal student.”</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll also created Adulting 101, a series of classes offered through the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office which are meant to supplement the academic curriculum students are enrolled in.</p>\n<p>The classes are meant to teach students important life skills about what it means to be an adult in the “real world.”</p>\n<p>The first class was held in February and focused on ways to reduce energy bills in order to save money and help with financial situations.</p>\n<p>The next class will take place in June and will inform dog owners about vaccinations, training and dog-care basics, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll hopes that the Adulting 101 program will continue into next year.</p>\n<p>She explained that all of her projects have been funded through funds allocated to her office. A large portion of those funds went toward a project that plans to distribute guides to the community that contain information about various resources in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We are distributing guides that have all the resources in Isla Vista, everything from the Pardall office hours to dispatch numbers for the Isla Vista foot patrol, to all 5,000 doors in Isla Vista,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>The guides have been made and are in the process of being paid for, according to Labowe-Stoll. She said the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) and the Finance and Business Committee are also funding the project.</p>\n<p>The guides will be distributed at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said the project was meant to be executed during Fall Quarter 2017, but was postponed due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a>. The project was again postponed during the Montecito mudslides in Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>The project was postponed an additional time at the beginning of this quarter as a result of the  the A.S. election season and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\">Measure R</a> efforts, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she represented students by attending meetings held by organizations such as Isla Vista Safe, which are chaired by the district attorney of Santa Barbara County and occur once per quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Labowe-Stoll, she also consistently attended Isla Vista Community Network meetings that occur once per month, along with Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) meetings that occur once every two weeks.</p>\n<p>“I pride myself in being the voice of the students. I think EVPLAs have chosen to take on different aspects of their position, but that’s one that I really take pride in,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p><em>Nexus </em>reporters, who attend almost every CSD meeting, reported seeing Labowe-Stoll on an occasional basis.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus, </em>Labowe-Stoll also reflected on Deltopia, which she believes was a success.</p>\n<p>“I think that UCIV and the volunteer base that they’ve cultivated has really helped the process, and I think that being able to help UCIV and the Public Safety Commission with resources and my time has really been valuable to me and to them, too,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>“I take a lot of pride in the fact that we’ve been able to really make Deltopia into a much more positive and safe environment,” she added. “From my perspective, I think it was definitely a win.”</p>\n<p>While citation and arrest numbers dropped this year at Deltopia, the number of medical transports <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/deltopia-attendance-medical-emergencies-rise/\">increased. </a></p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll also said she has been involved with the Measure R campaign and strongly encourages everyone in her office to volunteer their time through canvassing.</p>\n<p>“A.S. takes a very different role in this in the sense that we can’t outright advocate for or against it because of the constraints that we have, but I try to educate people as much as I can,” Labowe-Stoll said. “Obviously I want Measure R to pass very much, I think that it is kind of the final step in the CSD to be able to have this funding to distribute back to the community.”</p>\n<p>She also provided details as to why certain aspects of her platform were not completed.</p>\n<p>Her platform included creating a “Rate My Landlord” website, which would have allowed students to rank and comment on landlords in Isla Vista. She later discovered that there were legal issues regarding students commenting freely on their landlords, as it could lead to lawsuits based on slander.</p>\n<p>She also wanted to create a community court, which would have been an I.V. based program that allowed students charged with minor misdemeanors to deal with officials in I.V. instead of being sent to downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll was unable to complete the project and said she “realized how big it was” and how much legal attention it required as she began to speak to Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>“This was something that I was going to work with Joan Hartmann on. We connected on it a lot at the beginning of the year and I think she got busy and it also kind of fell through,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Another one of Labowe-Stoll’s goals was to institute a parking system where specific parking spots in I.V. could be identified along sidewalks, which would ensure more parking places, but said the project would be postponed until Measure R comes to a vote.</p>\n<p>“[Parking] is a CSD power, and it involves a lot of time and money in terms of running surveys and that kind of stuff,” Labowe-Stoll said. “When I started working on it in the beginning, they [the CSD] said ‘We want to work on it too, obviously it’s our power, but we don’t have any money, so let’s wait for the tax to pass,’ so it pretty much depends on the [Measure R] tax.”</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll’s platform also included having Hartmann hold regular office hours in Isla Vista, which was successful. Hartmann holds office hours once a month after the Isla Vista Community Network meetings.</p>\n<p>“I honestly, truly attempted everything I put on my platform,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer was elected to be EVPLA for the 2018-19 school year.</p>\n<p><em>Updated 4:01 p.m.: This article was updated to include information about the EVPLA-elect, Jeike Meijer. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version on this article appeared on pg.4 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

all the work that came with it lived up to her expectations.</p>\n<p>“I felt like I had a lot of insight coming into office … I made sure I knew what I was getting myself into,” she said.</p>\n<p>Her position as UC Santa Barbara’s external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) required her to advocate on behalf of the student body to the University of California Regents, UC Office of the President and other partner organizations with Associated Students (A.S.).</p>\n<p>Hsu told the <em>Nexus</em> she believes she successfully addressed all of her campaign platforms during her year in office.</p>\n<p>She ran on a platform of advocating to legislators for the “rights, resources, and representation of students across the state and nation.”</p>\n<p>During her time as EVPSA, Hsu focused on preventing a tuition increase for the 2018-2019 school year that the UC Regents were planning to impose in response to the lack of state funding.</p>\n<p>Hsu went on a number of advocacy trips throughout the year to advocate on behalf of UCSB students to encourage the UC Regents to listen to student needs including advocating for bills regarding sexual assault, violence and harassment on campus.</p>\n<p>Because of the work Hsu and other student advocates have been doing to prevent this increase, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-29/uc-regents-postpone-vote-on-tuition-hike/\">postponed the vote</a> to raise in-state tuition until the end of May and have instead begun partnering with students to advocate for more funding from the state, Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Hsu, along with UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang, A.S. President Hieu Le and other university members went to Sacramento to meet with legislators and lobby for “budget asks and what [A.S.] determines to be priorities.”</p>\n<p>The group asked legislators for $140 million to address “deferred maintenance, over enrollment [for the 2017-18 school year] and buying out the tuition increase.”</p>\n<p>The latter was in response to Governor Brown’s proposed budget for the UC, which was significantly less than the Regents expected.</p>\n<p>The results of their efforts will be seen in June when the legislators create a budget for the UC and submit it to the House and Senate.</p>\n<p>In addition to lobbying for students, Hsu promised to “advocate for the establishment of a campus-based Middle Class Scholarship for UCSB students as a response to the elimination of the CA Middle Class Scholarship.”</p>\n<p>Initially, Brown planned to eliminate it, but later decided not to following public and legislative backlash.</p>\n<p>Since the scholarship was never eliminated a replacement was not necessary to implement, Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also fulfilled her goal of bringing all candidates running for California Governor to UCSB to speak with students.</p>\n<p>Governor Candidate Delaine Eastin visited UCSB on Earth Day, Antonio Villaraigosa will be visiting in a few weeks, and both John Chiang and Gavin Newsom are planning to visit before the June 5 primaries, according to Hsu.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s final platform item stated she would “collaborate with key state and student organizers to work on a system-wide campaign to reclaim the cost of higher education during the 2018 election.” Hsu said she has worked with Reclaim California’s Higher Education Coalition throughout the school year to create an informational video, released in October, that explains how people of all backgrounds can achieve higher education.</p>\n<p>“In some shape or form I have responded to all my platorm points,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said she is most proud of helping unite students voices at UCSB with state legislators who can make changes to the higher education system, specifically in regards to their fight for increased budgets.</p>\n<p>“It’s always been a struggle of whether these powers or institutions or higher authorities will take students seriously,” she said. “I think this year the work that UCSB students have done really shows that we are a force to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Hsu said the money the EVPSA’s office received for the 2017-2018 school year went to funding their advocacy trips and events the office hosted throughout the year, including the GOP tax panel last fall, which featured Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>“This panel was set to inform people about how [the GOP tax] would affect both undergraduate and graduate students alike,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also partnered with Rose Le, the EVPSA office’s mental health coordinator, to organize a panel for the science, technology, engineering and mathematics students on campus to aid them in maintaining their mental health amidst the stresses of their heavy class load.</p>\n<p>Nushi Yapabandara, the Re-Ignite coordinator for EVPSA, praised Hsu and the rest of the team for the work they were able to accomplish this year.</p>\n<p>“[The EVPSA is] one of the most productive A.S. exec offices and I am going to miss being able to work with such down-to-earth people in the ‘real world,’” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara and Hsu partnered together to work on projects including the establishment of permIGNITE, an organization on campus that works to “empower the marginalized voices that proudly exist within the UC campuses and beyond,” according to the EVPSA’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the biggest challenge that both she and her team faced over the year was time.</p>\n<p>“Everyone else works on this regular calendar year January through December, but student leaders work May to May which is odd,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the unusual time differences were difficult because students live such different lives than regular government officials.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s elected successor was fourth-year global and Chicanx studies double major Mayela Morales, who was later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified from her position</a> by A.S. Elections Board on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>As she transitions out of her position, Hsu wants the student body to know about all the hard work that both she and the rest of A.S. do throughout the year.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is really a space for students to be their own advocates and … to feel empowered on the issues that they care about,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/","id":2268,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2267,2266,2265],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: S.A.G.

After a year in office, he looks back on his term as filled with challenges,  accomplishments and advocacy.</p>\n<p>“I think that to be S.A.G., you have to have a very present voice. You have to be willing to be vocal and be present,” Tannenbaum said.</p>\n<p>The responsibilities of the student advocate general (S.A.G.) include overseeing the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) and its staff, educating the student body on students’ rights and promoting awareness of services offered by the office.</p>\n<p>OSA’s role on campus is to inform and assist students facing charges from UC Santa Barbara in issues relating to housing, academics, public interest and social conduct, essentially “serving as the campus public defender,” according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>S.A.G. is also required to act as a nonpartisan representative for all undergraduates on campus, according to the A.S. Elections Code.</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum, a fourth-year economics major, said his term was filled with both growth and uncertainty.</p>\n<p>In leading new projects expanding the purview of the OSA as well as maintaining efficiency of the caseworkers, Tannenbaum said he had to balance the needs of individual students as well as those of the student body as a whole.</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum led projects including the polling analyst project, rewriting the legal code for positions in OSA and renovating the OSA website.</p>\n<p>OSA case workers work with students individually, guiding them through the university’s judicial process. This can include helping students organize their case documents, providing mediation and accompanying hearings, according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>He said one of the biggest projects during his term was the polling analyst project, which he claims stemmed from his commitment to nonpartisanship as well as his determination to innovate strategies for representing UCSB’s student body, he said.</p>\n<p>The project was initiated in Fall Quarter of 2017 and aims to shed light on marginalized or underrepresented voices at UCSB by polling the student body on their opinions and needs, according to Tannenbaum.</p>\n<p>The poll was intended to be included at the end of the ballet form for A.S. elections, but due to setbacks had to be postponed until a later time. The poll will be implemented before the end of the year, Tannenbaum said.</p>\n<p>“Starting a project from scratch is tough and I would say we were in new territory in how we wanted to implement this,” he said.</p>\n<p>He said it was important to collect substantive information about the priorities of students so he could bring it to the attention of the A.S. and continued to pursue this project despite obstacles that arose.</p>\n<p>Rose Ettleson, OSA chief of staff, worked closely with Tannenbaum during his term and attributed his successes in outreach as S.A.G. in part to his charismatic personality.</p>\n<p>Alex Funk, OSA external deputy chief, said Tannenbaum’s character played a role in the hiring process for OSA case workers.</p>\n<p>“He wasn’t necessarily so focused on purely technically minded or technically sound people, what he was focused on was people that he could work with,” Funk said. “You’re not looking just at merit, you’re looking at like the more holistic view of a person and I thought that was really admirable.”</p>\n<p>During his term, Tannenbaum revamped the OSA website, which when he entered the position, had errors throughout its pages including incorrectly listing past a S.A.G. as current a current caseworker.</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum also spoke to transfer students in lectures about the role of the OSA in assisting students with issues like plagiarism.</p>\n<p>Instead of speaking about a focus point of judicial consequences, Tannenbaum instead spoke to students about the advocacy that OSA can provide when students have issues that bring them to the OSA office.</p>\n<p>“We’ve made some inroads in kind of strengthening relationships between our office and administration which is really vital to making sure we can best advocate for students,” Tannenbaum said.</p>\n<p>In Tannenbaum’s campaign platform, he estimated that the OSA office served approximately 20 cases per quarter. This year, Tannenbaum estimated that OSA served as many students this year as last year, and possibly more.</p>\n<p>Before coming into office Tannenbaum did not have previous experience in the OSA, but he said his time serving as a proxy during Senate meetings cultivated an appreciation he now holds for nonpartisan work and led him to the position in his final year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>He also said he has found fulfillment in helping students find resolutions to the issues that bring them to OSA.</p>\n<p>“Our office provides a space and people who are there to say ‘you’re not alone. We have the institutional knowledge to help,’” Tannenbaum said. “It’s been a really amazing and gratifying experience to be able to be in that space … and try my best and try to enable others to help those in times of need.”</p>\n<p>As for advice for next year’s S.A.G., Grecia Martinez, Tannenbaum said maintaining an active voice for all students and guiding them toward solutions should remain the focus throughout the term.</p>\n<p>“That’s really what our job is about… being there for students in times of need,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The CSD arrived at the figures by calculating eight percent of all I.V. bills in 2017 for the five utilities.</p>\n<p>Dividing that amount by the number of I.V. residents, 23,096 <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217\">according to the 2010 census</a>, means that individuals will each have to pay approximately $30.41 annually.</p>\n<p>The tax figures originally projected the CSD would accrue $834,993, though additional deductions the CSD is still considering would drop the number to $702,444.</p>\n<p>There are two specific deductions the CSD is considering: a state-owned exemption which amounts to $7,300 and a low-income exemption which totals $125,249 of tax savings for residents.</p>\n<p>A low-income exemption would excuse residents from paying the 8 percent tax on gas, water and electricity.</p>\n<p>Residents would be able to qualify for the exemption by providing proof they are enrolled in the California Alternate Rates for Energy or Family Electric Rate Assistance programs. They would also need proof they own the electricity utility account enrolled in the assistance program.</p>\n<p>In order to apply for the exemption, residents would have to file an application with the general manager of the CSD.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://sbcassessor.com/SampleballotandpollplaceLookup/ballots/bt000009.pdf\">the language readers will see at the </a>voting booth, the tax revenue will be used to fund “local improvements to parking, public safety, lighting, and sidewalks.”</p>\n<p>The language also states that the funds will be used to provide tenant-landlord mediation services, create a municipal advisory council and operate community facilities and events such as the I.V. Community Room at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar or the I.V. Community Center, both of which are behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>The ballot language originally claimed that the tax would accrue $642,000 in funds a year, though the CSD’s preliminary estimate is higher.<strong>  </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82998\" style=\"width: 1008px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1237702627\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83018\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82998\" data-attachment-id=\"82998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/measure-r/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=998%2C324&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"998,324\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure r\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=888%2C288&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82998\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=888%2C288\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Above, a summary of the Isla Vista Community Services District’s revenue sources from the CSD’s Tuesday special meeting report.

The report projects that the CSD’s total revenue will reach $932,944 with the passage of the tax and by fully acquiring the $200,000 UCSB has pledged.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

documents released to the public during the Community Services District’s (CSD) Tuesday meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s very likely that there will be a cannabis dispensary in Isla Vista,” said Ethan Bertrand, CSD president.</p>\n<p>Residents of Santa Barbara County will get the chance to vote on Measure T, also known as the Cannabis Operations General Tax, in the June 5 primary election.</p>\n<p>The board voted to endorse the measure with all board members voting in favor except for George Thurlow, who was absent for the meeting.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, any individual who “engages” in cannabis operations, including the “cultivating, manufacturing, producing, processing, preparing, storing, providing, donating, selling or distributing cannabis” within unincorporated areas of the county would pay a tax on each of the operation’s activities, according to documents released by the county.</p>\n<p>The tax will vary depending on the classification of the business. Nurseries and distributors will pay 1 percent of the total amount an organization receives during its accounting period; manufacturers will pay 3 percent, cultivators will pay 4 percent and retail and micro businesses will pay 6 percent, according to documents released by the county.</p>\n<p>First District Supervisor Das Williams, who chairs the county board, said in a written statement that it is “imperative” that the marijuana is taxed to “ensure compliance and to eradicate the black market.”</p>\n<p>“With legalization comes needed enforcement, education and other services. Santa Barbara County needs to tax cannabis growers and businesses to enforce our ordinance and fund other priorities,” he said in an argument in favor of the measure, which he wrote on behalf of the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p>The board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/land-ordinance-limits-marijuana-sales-in-iv-uc-students-opposed/\">passed an ordinance</a> in early February requiring a buffer zone between marijuana dispensaries and areas with schools or daycare centers, meaning dispensaries cannot be located within 750 feet of these “sensitive areas.”</p>\n<p>Opponents of the measure, including District County Supervisor Peter Adam and Susan Brown, retired sergeant from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement that the measure will be “another blank check” for the county.</p>\n<p>“The County faces a $50 million deficit due to misplaced spending priorities,” the group that wrote the opposition statement on the ballot measure. “They want to spend the money how they want it spent, not how we want it spent.”</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board secretary for the CSD, said he is a big supporter of this measure because it is “necessary” for I.V. to have a dispensary one day.</p>\n<p>“The old I.V. residents would have loved to see this happen,” CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
