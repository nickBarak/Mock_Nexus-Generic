The I.V. CSD then contacted Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor for student affairs and dean of student life, to create a smaller-scale festival similar to UCSB’s SunFest, a festival held on campus for students as an alternative to Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with UCSB’s decision to move classes online at least through the end of April, the I.V. CSD’s Deltopia-alternative festival will not be held. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahead of Tuesday’s I.V. CSD board meeting, four agenda items were dedicated to a memorandum of understanding and contracts with various entities needed to carry out the smaller-scale festival held in lieu of the larger festival that was planned for 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a number of items relating to the April 4th community festival, which we will not be considering today in light of recent events,” Board President Spencer Brandt announced during the meeting. “What we would like to do is postpone the community festival to a later date.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said the I.V. CSD is currently in communication with UCSB, Santa Barbara City College, the County of Santa Barbara and public health officials to determine the new date for the community festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The now-defunct festival would have shared similar features to a carnival; the event would have included a rock wall, a water balloon toss, face-painting, local bands and free food provided by various I.V. businesses, according to Armistead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been directed on our campus not to host any events. In fact, most of everything’s canceled in April,” Armistead said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unknown how UCSB’s decision will affect the annual Deltopia, an unsanctioned street party planned for April 4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing is about Deltopia proper, the unsanctioned events, it’s really up to those who live in Isla Vista to decide when they want to do with [Deltopia]. So we’re going to keep eyes on it in terms of making sure our community is safe,” Armistead added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said that despite the delays, the planning for the festival did serve to lay the foundation for a festival in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a silver lining here,” Brandt explained. “We’ve done, essentially, all the legwork that we needed to get to a point where the community festival will become a reality and where we will be able to transition folks into an alternative event that is fun, that is safe and changes the vibe of what’s going on during Deltopia weekend in a significant way for the better.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

National University of Singapore, Singapore</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China summer 2020 programs</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hong Kong summer 2020 programs (for reasons not related to COVID-19)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public Health, Thailand</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel noted that the time difference made it difficult for her family, who often heard about news like Trump’s travel suspension while she was asleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They hear about everything before I do, and they’re freaking out for me, and I’m trying to calm them down from another continent,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some students and their families, the stress of not knowing when — not if, when — the program would be canceled was too much to bear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends, her dad was freaking out and she’s going home tomorrow morning,” she said. “He called her yesterday and was like ‘I can’t handle this anymore, I don’t even know if your program’s gonna get cancelled but I’m buying you a ticket to come home.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the programs have officially been canceled, UCEAP has been working with both the host universities abroad and the students’ home UC campuses to coordinate course credit, financial aid and all the other lingering questions that remain for these students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said she was told by her study abroad advisor that UCEAP was attempting to convert the study abroad courses to online courses, so students could finish their semesters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But that sounds so impossible to me,” she said, while acknowledging that it would be her best option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once she received the official cancelation email from UCEAP, Pimentel said she would probably book her flight home for late next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t imagine having to crash courses if we can’t even be on campus until the end of April,” she said. “I don’t know how I would go about getting myself into classes. I also don’t know how I would handle housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, Pimentel is focusing on enjoying her last few days abroad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know, I just don’t want to come home. It’s two months early, and it’s really disappointing and really sad, but I just keep trying to remind myself that it could be worse,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/19/20 3:45 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/17/20 3:02 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/16/20 11:30 a.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/14/20 2:12 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

However, personnel managers were adamant that students follow dining hall protocol and not remove food from Ortega, leading to a brief confrontation with activists and students leaving with to-go plates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as lines for food got longer and began to stretch around the building, organizers continued to encourage students to take food to go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to occupy Ortega was made to show how the UC “functions as a business rather than a school,” according to the COLA press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By liberating this dining commons, we draw attention to how food insecurity functions daily on our campus, keeping us from being the students, teachers, and mentors we want to be. While graduate students are currently on a wildcat strike, this action demonstrates that our movement is not only dedicated to achieving fair pay but also to changing the priorities of the public university system to better fit the needs of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> students,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the statement continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most students who entered the building seemed to support the graduate students’ actions. One student, Kayla Katsuda, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, noted that she came for the free lunch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends told me about what was going on, and I came because I don’t have a meal plan,” Katsuda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One UCSB student and Ortega Dining Commons employee explained to the Nexus that he “didn’t know what was going on” at first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They seemed to be letting all people in, and the food is overpriced, so I would agree with that. You could easily go to Isla Vista and get a better meal … so I agree [with the strikes]. The food is very expensive,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB did not respond to requests for comment regarding the Monday occupation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As lunchtime attendees exited Ortega, organizers advertised the ongoing strikes and spoke about how undergraduates can help with the COLA movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re on the picket line outside of Storke Tower from 8 to 5 every day,” one organizer told a student leaving with a to-go plate. “Hope to see you there!” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Ramsey contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

The chain of command, however, is not a strict hierarchy, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student exhibits coronavirus symptoms, Javanbakht said the university would notify the SB County Public Health Department about the potential case, which will advise Student Health as to whether or not to test the individual based on “how suspicious” their case is or the likelihood that they may have coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a pretty suspicious [case], then the next step is, ‘Okay, who else could have been exposed?’ And if it’s a student, that [case] comes back to us,” Javanbakht said. “And if that student’s symptoms are in line with the guidelines, that’s someone that we need to test.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But students don’t always go straight to Student Health, Javanbakht said. It’s up to the SB County Public Health Department to notify Student Health if a student exhibits symptoms somewhere else, such as at a local emergency room or urgent care, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Student Health and the SB County Public Health Department reasonably suspect that a student may have coronavirus, the public health department will work to pin down who they’ve been in contact with in the past two weeks to “expand that circle,” according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an example, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would calculate the risk a potentially infected student posed to their classmates by sending someone to campus to survey the features of classroom spaces, including looking at the room’s dimensions and the space between tables or desks to determine which students may have been exposed if a student had coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, Javanbakht said Student Health would work with the registrar’s office to find people who were potentially exposed to coronavirus and would let them know that “they might need to be tested.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student does test positive for coronavirus, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would contact individuals who were “close enough to be exposed” and instruct them to isolate themselves and “find their own room separate from everyone else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people who had a low-risk exposure, Javanbakht said they could still go about their day but said that it was important to report symptoms as soon as possible, because “then we need to intervene.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB runs out of space to house exposed students, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department will provide the university with additional space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, UCSB and Isla Vista are notorious for their often-cramped living situations, so “if people are in close quarters,” Javanbakht said, “that’s absolutely a factor.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This stuff tends to live on surfaces, and if you have a lot of people close [to each other] touching the common surfaces, yeah, the risk tends to be higher than someone who’s out on a farm by themselves,” he added, stressing the importance of keeping good hygiene.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep the campus community informed about the coronavirus, Student Health has sent a number of emails to the student body in the past two months to quell concerns and provide updates on potential cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the scenes, Javanbakht said Student Health has reached out to campus entities that deal with a high volume of students, such as the Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises, the Department of Recreation and the University Library, to detail hygiene methods that can decrease the spread of coronavirus on campus, such as using hand sanitizer and reminding students to wash their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Feb. 13 emergency operations meeting, a number of campus representatives met to discuss a potential response to coronavirus cases on campus, with each representative giving feedback on what resources they could provide in case of an outbreak on campus, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht also noted that all five UC medical centers and all 10 UC campuses participate in a twice-a-week phone call with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) to share information about positive and potential coronavirus cases.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Health is also in contact with the UCOP medical director, who works with the medical directors at each UC campus to inform them about ongoing cases at universities outside the UC and their efforts to treat and contain them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Javanbakht said Student Health is in the midst of preparing a message for the student body about coronavirus and traveling for spring break, as many students are a couple weeks away from packing their bags and leaving Santa Barbara to go home or on vacation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said the message will warn students about traveling to countries impacted by coronavirus and the possibility of being quarantined in another country or being isolated when returning to campus, he said. It will also include a reminder to report any possible symptoms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So between now and the end of spring break, as developments come up, if something changes, if there’s a new area of activity that we need to be concerned about, then we send messages again,” Javanbakht added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As coronavirus spreads, so does fear, which Javanbakht stressed as the “biggest threat to our campus.” Social media and rumors can instill fears that aren’t real or rational, and news headlines can trigger “fear mongering” if written poorly, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If all you’re looking at is coronavirus updates, over time, it can give a really distorted view and some people can take on what’s called a catastrophic view — that this is a catastrophe,” he said. “Realistically speaking, right now, the risk to 24,000 students on this campus [is] still relatively low.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Again, things might change but overall, right now, go about your day [and] practice good hand hygiene,” Javanbakht said. “We’re doing everything we can.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

graduate students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who were fired for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades as part of their COLA strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After UCSC, UCSB’s COLA movement marks the second UC campus to begin a full strike; Thursday’s action marked one </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">full week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since UCSB graduate students began striking. COLA organizers across the UC system called for the one-day strike, asking professors to halt lectures, students to walk out of class and for participants to wear black, hence the name “black-out” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The motto of the UC system is “let there be light,” one speaker said at the Storke Tower noon rally. “When we wear black, it shows the UC administration that without graduate student labor, there is no light.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC-wide work stoppage started early morning on Thursday; at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, protesters blocked all four entrances to Cheadle Hall — UCSB’s administrative building — and stood shoulder-to-shoulder at each entrance. At the front entrance, organizers held a sign that read, “FUCK THE UC! AND A BITCH NAMED JANET.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some administrators who work in Cheadle Hall argued with strikers and attempted to force their way through but were pushed back, sending administrators and staffers circling around the building in hopes of finding another way in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, you guys, I don’t fucking support you. We have to work too,” one employee said to COLA organizers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers continued to refuse to allow administrators to enter into the building, including Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the UC Police Department and administration spoke with protesters, saying they had to move or risk being arrested, organizers regrouped and decided to move inside instead, occupying every floor of the building and chanting, “Don’t cross the picket, don’t be a scab,” to employees as they entered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One undergraduate advisor left his office to explain to strikers that “the students that we see are just as stressed as you are.” After organizers began arguing and chanting — drowning out the advisor</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Ry Brennan, one of COLA’s de-escalators, came to help defuse the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brennan and the advisor reached a compromise, in which strikers would be alerted to stay quiet should any undergraduates come into the building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After occupying Cheadle Hall for most of the morning, organizers started to gear up for the noon rally. At approximately 11:30 a.m., students and faculty holding “Faculty for COLA” and “You’re gonna have to fire us too, Janet,” banners marched from Cheadle Hall to Storke Tower and met with demonstrators who had been there since 8 a.m. as part of their regularly scheduled strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Storke Tower, UC worker unions and academic associations expressed their solidarity with and support of UCSB’s COLA movement to an animated crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers representing different unions emphasized a message of solidarity between various unions, all fighting for better treatment from the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a UCSB groundskeeper and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME) Local 3299 member, noted the similarities between the COLA movement and the labor strikes throughout the country, including AFSCME 3299’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">labor fight over the past few years. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every person in this country deserves that security, and that’s why we won’t stop fighting until we have a job that’s worth having and a way to pay rent. You have our support as workers, and I know not a lot of people [from AFSCME] made it out here today because they’re very busy, but I’ve been talking to them at work and you absolutely have our support,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Colvin, Christopher John Newfield, a professor of literature and American studies at UCSB and second vice president of the executive council of the Modern Language Association (MLA) of America, emphasized the MLA’s “unanimous and quite enthusiastic” commitment to support the UC-wide strikers and condemned the termination of UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 1 p.m., the procession of approximately 3,000 marched to Henley Gate, garnering the attention of those on campus as they passed through the Arbor and University Library. Those in “precarious situations,” such as undocumented or international students, were encouraged to walk by organizers wearing red armbands and caution tape, who were designated de-escalators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Henley Gate, the crowd chanted, “Cops off campus, COLA in our bank accounts,” at cars driving by and police officers monitoring the event. Protesters stayed at the gate for nearly 30 minutes before walking back to Storke, where some remained to complete the daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York University sociology professor Andrew Ross visited Santa Barbara to take part in the strike, praising attendees as a catalyst for social change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Graduate student employees are the true conscience of the academic profession, and COLA strikers are the true conscience of the UAW,” Ross said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one deserves to be paid a poverty wage because they love teaching or because they’re training for a job in an academic profession,” he said. “That is not a principle of fair labor, that is a recipe for exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi and Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

At first, there were three confirmed cases in Italy around Feb. 24, Woo said. But in the next four days, the number of confirmed cases skyrocketed to around 400, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With all of this happening, a lot of the students, all the people I talked to about it, they were just kind of talking about it amongst ourselves because the school didn’t really say anything about it,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Woo said she wasn’t as concerned about the virus itself, particularly because it is more dangerous for the elderly and people with illnesses, she said she was worried that she would have to be quarantined once she returned, which could affect her spring quarter enrollment at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was just afraid that, knowing [President Donald Trump], that he was gonna implement a travel ban and do something drastic that could leave us like stranded [in Italy],” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if we came back at the same day that we’re supposed to, if we got quarantined for two weeks, that would mean that’d we’d miss the first week of classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days leading up to the program’s suspension, Woo said she was frequently checking news sites and getting traveler alerts about the increasing risk in Italy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the university did send emails to students to let them know it was monitoring the situation, Woo and several other students emailed UCEAP coordinators criticizing the minimal communication from UCEAP, particularly as the situation in Italy began to develop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though [UCEAP] said they were monitoring the situation, they didn’t really give updates, they just kind of gave us a link a couple days ago and told us to check on it ourselves,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students that I was talking to knew a lot more about the situation than the school itself, or at least what the school was telling us, which was really frustrating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a day before the Italy program was officially suspended, Woo said students received an email saying that they could choose to withdraw from the program early. But Woo noted that, for many students, buying a last-minute plane ticket isn’t financially feasible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a quote unquote optional thing, it’s not really optional for those students,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the program was officially suspended on Feb. 28, UCEAP told students they could submit claims to be reimbursed for their tickets for up to $2,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Woo and other students in the Florence program only received four units per course as opposed to five due to the program suspension. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no programs beyond Italy, South Korea and China have been suspended so far, Edmond said UCEAP was “monitoring the entire world at this point.” As of Wednesday evening, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that at least 95,400 people across the globe had the virus, and that people in at least 80 countries had been infected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are preparing to go abroad are being told to continue as if their programs will be held, according to Edmond.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Khamenian, a third-year communication major, is scheduled to study abroad in Japan for spring quarter through UCEAP, but Japan is currently at a Level Two alert. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In three weeks, I have a plane ticket to go abroad for spring quarter in Japan, and everything’s set, my plan has been to go third-year, spring quarter, but obviously the coronavirus and everything has kind of put me in a limbo,” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything’s prepped for me to go abroad, but I don’t actually know if I’m going abroad.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Japan, elementary through high schools were recently shut down, but there haven’t been any cancellations for universities so far, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/japan-schools-coronavirus.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCEAP is telling me, ‘We’ll let you know if CDC says it’s Level 3’ … in that case we don’t go, but that could be when I’m in Japan in three weeks, and it can be the second day there, and they could be like, ‘Oh yeah, actually go back,’” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the possibility of her study abroad program being cancelled, Khamenian would have to deal with finding housing and registering for classes, which she doesn’t think would be a possibility so last minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know if I should pack for going abroad or for going home for break only,” Khamenian added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s so many things up in the air.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

UCSD’s COLA movement took to Twitter, denouncing the university for not canceling the celebration, writing: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSD has an unhealthy obsession with Theodor Geisel AKA Dr. Seuss.

Both Shofet and Shahaf are working together to address food insecurity, specifically for those who only eat halal and kosher food, by providing them with food that fits their dietary needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Halal and Kosher Program creates weekly grocery bags for low income students who follow Halal and Kosher dietary restrictions,” Shahaf said in an email. “Every week the bags have a breakfast option, a set of instant lunches, potential snacks, and a dinner option.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Shahaf, the program is currently funded through the UCSB Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce; it also partners with the Isla Vista Food Cooperative (I.V. Co-op), which provides the food at discount prices and assists with transportation. Shahaf and the I.V. Co-op communicate through weekly emails and occasional meetings to plan what food items will be in the bags for that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how we would be running this program without the Isla Vista Food Cooperative’s charitable nature and the discounted pricing they offer us,” Shahaf stated. “Their amazing team, as well as the food bank employees, help me load all the food into a van headed to the food bank, where we assemble and place the bags.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf explained that the Associated Students Food Bank also plays an integral role in the program running smoothly, as its employees assist in picking up bulk orders, assemble bags and help sign in Halal and Kosher Program participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf said she constantly communicates with leading members of campus organizations such as the I.V.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students are on a “wildcat” strike, meaning that they are striking without the approval of their union and contract. </span><em>Jonathan Sloboda / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2865 filed formal charges against the UC with California Public Employment Relations Board (PERB), alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the complaints, UAW 2865 alleged that the UC attempted to bargain for a COLA with individuals and groups instead of the union. It also alleged that the UC went outside of the collective bargaining agreement with UAW by firing teaching assistants for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every member of the union will soon have the chance to democratically vote on whether or not we can hold a strike. If approved, this action would be statewide, and could affect every department at the University of California,” UAW 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar said in a press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the COLA movement grows across the UC, graduate students have emphasized that their actions are a “wildcat” strike, meaning that they are striking without the approval of their union and contract, which was negotiated by UAW in 2018 and expires in 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/janet-napolitano-ucsc-administration-warn-of-termination-to-striking-ucsc-graduate-students/\">wrote</a> on Feb. 14 to UCSC faculty that the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) would not “re-open the agreement or negotiate a separate side-letter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 24, the UC Regents filed an <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\">Unfair Practice Charge</a> against UAW. Since the UC system is a public institution, all labor disputes go through PERB when one party in a state labor contract alleges another of unfair practice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents allege that UAW “condoned, supported, encouraged, and failed to take affirmative action to end, unlawful concerted activity in violation of the parties’ No Strikes clause,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Unfair Practice Charge will be decided by PERB in a public hearing if the charges are not settled beforehand. A hearing date has not been set, according to UAW statewide Trustee and doctoral history student Andrew Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents are requesting that PERB issue multiple orders of action against UAW: one declaring the work stoppages at UCSC and all other UC campuses an illegal strike, and another order for UAW to refrain from engaging in any strikes, according to the charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents are also requesting that PERB seek an injunction to prevent Academic Student Employees (ASE) — which includes teaching assistants, tutors and readers — and UAW from engaging in strikes and “any other relief the Board deems just and proper,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the two orders both restrict current strikes, if enacted, the injunction would give the UC the authority to forcibly shut down strikes with police at all UC campuses, according to Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the UC Regents’ unfair practice charge, UAW filed two separate Unfair Practice Charges on Feb. 28 and March 2 against the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\">first set</a> of charges allege that the UC refused to negotiate a COLA with UAW, while at the same time bargaining directly with individuals and university-funded student organizations, which don’t have the legal authority to bargain with the UC, according to a UAW press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear that UC wants to create an appearance that it is respecting graduate student employees while avoiding true bargaining, where the law requires the parties to stand with equal footing and to act in good faith,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no current bargaining between graduate students and UCOP, Napolitano published a statement on Feb. 21 saying that she would meet with the UC Graduate and Professional Council (UCGPC) to discuss a variety of issues including “cost of living.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC then published a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/ucgpc-says-it-will-not-meet-with-napolitano-to-discuss-a-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">statement</a> clarifying that the meeting was not in response to COLA, and that the timing and wording of Napolitano’s statement caused a misunderstanding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charges also referenced the offer UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive extended to striking graduate students, which included guaranteed five-year packages for Ph.D. students and two-year packages for M.A. students, along with a $2,500 annual housing supplement for graduate students who submitted fall quarter grades and stopped striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\">second set</a> of Unfair Practice Charges, filed on March 2, allege that the UC violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\">dismissing</a> UCSC TAs from spring quarter appointments for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades; according to the charges, the UC “denies these workers their statutory right to union representation and is intended to bypass the union.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These charges led to the UAW Bargaining Team’s vote on March 3, paving the way for a full UAW vote of whether or not to hold a labor practice strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have been calling for the University to come to the table and negotiate a Cost of Living Adjustment for months now. And it is not true that UC can’t reopen the contract that was ratified in 2018. It’s that they won’t. We ask them every day to open the contract and negotiate a</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COLA4ALL?src=hashtag_click\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> #COLA4ALL</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
