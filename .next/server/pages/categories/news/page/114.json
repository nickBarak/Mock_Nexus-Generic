The grant for Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success (ONDAS), a Title V program, will be distributed over five years and will focus on improving student success and graduation rates by expanding educational opportunities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director of Research Development for the Social Sciences, Humanities and Fine Arts in the UCSB Office of Research Barbara Endemaño Walker said the grant will provide access to summer “enrichment” resources such as intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and the ONDAS Success Center which provide support from community scholars, peer tutoring and a designated study space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ITS we plan to use is ALEKS, which was originally developed at UC Irvine,” Walker said in an email. “It is used at several UC’s, and the UCSB Chemistry Department already uses it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Walker, 10 majors and 41 courses were found to put students at risk of probation and impeded graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Undergraduate students are placed on probation when their cumulative GPA drops below 2.0,” Walker said in an email. “We determined which first year courses (for both freshmen and transfer students) … have a combination of both high enrollment and the lowest final average GPA.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the grant will focus on first-year experiences and faculty professional development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It aims] to address the challenges of underrepresented and low-income students in certain majors and to help with the first-year retention rates,” Dela Cruz said. “That, to me, is very important because I come from a low-income community that is certainly underrepresented — I come from Compton.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walker said the ONDAS Success Center will remain active after the five-year grant program ends through financial funding sources such as grants, gifts and campus resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The grant will begin this fall,” Walker said in an email. “We will be piloting and ramping up the programs over the next year, and plan to have ONDAS fully operating by fall 2017.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Mohsin Mirza said the grant will improve student life and student representation in “more competitive” majors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I ultimately hope this grant is going to help students of all backgrounds excel in majors where they traditionally have not,” Mirza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dela Cruz said she notices her friends struggling in STEM majors such as chemical engineering and biology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of them actually changed their majors,” Dela Cruz said “One of my best friends was on academic probation because she was not excelling in those classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dela Cruz, the grant will address issues impacting minority and marginalized groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By looking specifically at these issues, you are allowing a diverse group of individuals to feel comfortable on this campus,” Dela Cruz said. “You are trying to find alternative ways, creative ways, to make this group of students feel comfortable and make them successful individuals.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mirza said he hopes students as well as administrators will play active roles in deciding how the grant money should best be allocated to aid minority students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully, there is a maximum amount of student consultation and outreach in regards to where this money is going to be sent, in particular, with the communities with whom these grants have been issued,” Mirza said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Index is based on the share of students receiving Pell grants, the graduation rate of Pell grant recipients and the net cost after financial aid for low and middle income students. This year’s results led the NYT to call UC “California’s upward mobility machine.”</p>\n<p>Thirty-eight percent of UCSB students receive Pell grants, with 31 percent also likely to graduate based on past rates, and the net cost for low and middle income students is $14,000.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), University of California Student Association (UCSA) undergraduate chair and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major Mohsin Mirza said NYT’s praise of UC as an “upward mobility machine” is “somewhat incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Students of all incomes struggle with the rising costs of housing and textbooks,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>“While the UC should be praised for the amount of financial aid it provides to low income students, particularly in comparison to other universities, that praise should be tempered with the reality that there is much work to be done.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said while the College Access Index highlights the successes of UC, UCSA will continue to be critical.</p>\n<p>“We see our role as pushing the UC to be the best it possibly can be,” Mirza said. “Praise isn’t effective at creating changes, actions and pressure are.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop said she feels UCSB is “very proactive” in creating economic diversity and its high ranking in the College Access Index is a result of outreach efforts that start long before the admissions process.</p>\n<p>“We work closely with high school and community college counselors to spread the word about opportunities available at UCSB,” Przekop said in an email. “We also work with community organizations and early outreach programs to reach younger students and families as they begin to consider college preparation.”</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, one way UCSB works to serve low-income students is being “visible and available,” providing information that explains the application and financial aid processes and shows low-income families higher education is “a viable pathway to success.”</p>\n<p>“Some families don’t have a history of college attendance and fear that the cost is a barrier to even considering college,” Przekop said in an email. “We have special programs in place to meet the informational needs of first-generation and/or low-income students because they may not have easy access to that information otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said outreach and informational assistance are the only ways UC campuses increase their numbers of Pell-receiving students, because the admissions process itself is “need blind.”</p>\n<p>“Family income cannot be a deciding factor in admitting a student,” Przekop said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, the Office of Admissions promotes UCSB at over 600 high schools every fall and chooses campuses with students of all economic backgrounds, leading to greater economic diversity at the university.</p>\n<p>“These schools include those situated in low-income, middle-income, and high-income regions of the state,” Przekop said in an email. “We want students from all backgrounds because we want a diverse learning community.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and Pell grant recipient Chance Adkins said while he was surprised UCSB is ranked third in the nation on the College Access Index, he is not surprised it was ranked highly given his experience with financial aid opportunities.</p>\n<p>“I was offered more financial aid here than anywhere else,” Adkins said. “Talking to people who attend other universities, the gap between my financial aid and theirs is higher than one would expect, especially between the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Adkins said while he is glad aid is available when needed, he believes the high number of students receiving Pell grants at UC could explain in part the recent increases in tuition and is a sign that public higher education is increasingly unaffordable without aid.</p>\n<p>“With the way that tuition keeps increasing, it makes sense that more people are needing assistance,” Adkins said.</p>\n<p>Mirza said UC should be proud of the ranking but should not let it take away from the urgency to take on “problems that still exist.”</p>\n<p>“Between unaffordable housing, students skipping meals to save money, and the majority of students in the middle class, in particular taking on tens of thousands of dollars in debt, there is much work to be done,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Commission made it a goal to better address the concerns of the public in the upcoming meeting, which will include a presentation by staff from the Santa Barbara County Planning and Development and Santa Barbara County Public Works to discuss proposed parking strategies mentioned in the Isla Vista Master Plan.</p>\n<p>Fifth District SB County Planning and Development Commissioner Daniel Blough said he was doubtful of the survey results.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know when they did the survey, but the information was not accurate,” Blough said.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year mathematics major Brent Roth, the parking situation in I.V. is not conducive to students or residents, and parking spots are too small and not secure.</p>\n<p>“The parking situation in Isla Vista is just terrible, I can’t stress that enough,” Roth said. “The biggest issue is space and ensuring that your car is safe.”<br>\nFourth-year environmental studies major Lino Martinez said he has not seen a recent increase in parking.</p>\n<p>“The increase in 15 percent doesn’t seem like it represents actually what is occurring,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>According to Second District SB County Planning and Development Commissioner Cecilia Brown, the duty of the Planning Commission is to obtain accurate information regarding the current state of parking in I.V. with help from Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the meeting is to get current pertinent information about the parking situation and to get greater community input,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>Brown said she is glad there will be a meeting where the public can participate.</p>\n<p>“They need to participate, they need to come and tell the county what their experience is,” Brown said. “Their input is valuable.”</p>\n<p>County of SB Planning and Development Associate Planner Katie Hentrich said community input from the meeting this Monday will be discussed at the next Committee meeting.</p>\n<p>“The County is seeking feedback on the proposed parking strategies to survey parking availability,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>Hentrich said both the Planning and Development and the Public Work staff will present various solutions to the parking situation in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The proposed parking strategies include an on-street parking monitoring and reporting system to assess on-street parking capacity and vacancy rates in the community,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>If available parking is found to be below an increase of 15 percent then more surveys will be taken to find new strategies such as a permit system, according to Hentrich.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, if data results indicate vacancy rates remain low, a permit parking program would be implemented,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>Hentrich said she encourages community members to attend the meeting.</p>\n<p>“This meeting is a good opportunity for permanent residents and students to participate in the planning process,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

community of Isla Vista is certainly one of the biggest perks of attending UC Santa Barbara. Despite the iconic party scene and the picturesque setting, there are risks that are inevitable in a college town. Daily Nexus sat down with three students from the Associated Students Public Safety Commission to give you the tips you need to have a safe time out on the streets of I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Dwayne Mosbey</strong><br>\n<strong> A.S. Senator and Liaison to the Public Safety Commission Ashcon Minoiefar</strong><br>\n<strong> Former A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Molly Morrison</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What should students be cautious of when going into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> When on the streets or in a party, a simple look around at what is happening can keep you safe, your friends safe and out of trouble with law enforcement. Isla Vista is a friendly and fun place, so it should be enjoyed. But being conscious of what you or your friends are doing will keep you safe, out of jail or getting the infamous MIP (Minor in Possession) … Although it’s an amazing place, Isla Vista unfortunately falls victim to crimes like theft, assault and sexual assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Even though we are in a relatively safe community, be aware of areas with poor lighting and do not engage those who are behaving in an antagonistic manner towards you. When going out be sure to keep track of your drink and never allow anyone to make or give one to you.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What should students do to prepare for potentially dangerous situations?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The easiest way to get yourself into trouble is by not knowing what you or your friends plan on doing. If you’re going to drink and walk DP, which every freshman will understandably do, have a game plan if things don’t work out. Eat some food before, have an idea of where you want to go, have a backup plan if that doesn’t work out (Freebirds nachos are a solid move), and make sure you know where your friends are when you want to head back home. Pouring too many shots back and aimlessly wandering Isla Vista after not getting into any parties is a surefire way to get yourself into some trouble.<br>\nMosbey: When you go out, be sure to have friends accompany you and keep track of each other throughout the night! Familiarize yourself with the local area and as well be aware of the safest routes to take. Be sure to take care of your personal belongings and keep track of them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are some resources that students can access when they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The number-one resource students should be aware of is the CSO Escort program. The number is (805) 893-8000 … Call 911 if you or anyone around you is in any danger, perceived or real. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol can respond to a call very, very quickly and should always be reached out to … Good Samaritan Laws in California provide both the caller and the one in medical need amnesty from prosecution for minor crimes like minor in consumption or drug use. Their priority is getting the person in need of medical attention to the hospital, not citing you a MIP. So don’t hesitate to call.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services is the most valuable resource this campus has for students seeking mental help of any kind, ranging from the most benign forms of stress to other more serious disorders. There should be no stigma associated with wanting to seek help — Counseling and Psychological Services just fought a huge battle against UC budgets to stay a strong force on this campus, and students should really be utilizing this wonderful service more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> Who can students reach out to if they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> Make sure to go to your friends as a support group, no one will be there for you like the friends you meet here at UCSB. Professors can be great help when your course load is getting crazy. Stop by their office hours and you will be amazed how helpful they can be. The SRB [Student Resource Building] has a mind-boggling amount of services. The Womyn’s Center is an amazing resource for many things, including any services pertaining to sexual assault. If you are injured out in Isla Vista or wherever and are having trouble getting to class, check out the Disabled Students Program in the SRB for help.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> When students start to feel that they need help, the most important thing to do is NOT TO STAY QUIET! There are so many people who want to help, and all you have to do is ask. Don’t know where to go? Start with your RA. Don’t have an RA? Walk right into Student Health or Counseling and Psychological Services. No one is judgmental; everyone wants you to do well and BE well.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What do you recommend students bring with them when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Always be sure to have some form of ID when you go out, preferably a state-issued or government ID, as well as a fully charged phone, emergency contact information and your keys (for those who are prone to losing them, buy a carbineer or lanyard.)</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Buddy system. Too often have students wandered off by themselves, and most end up fine, but some have gotten into situations they did not intend, which can have really serious repercussions … When you go out, always carry a form of ID on you … Also bring an open, but grounded mind and heart. Being under any influence may make you more prone to decisions you wouldn’t make otherwise, so make sure to always have your best interests take priority over everything else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are common mistakes made by students, especially freshman or transfers, when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The most common mistake made in Isla Vista is not spacing out your shots or handle pulls. It’s really easy to fill time between conversations with shots. But what we don’t realize until we make this mistake a few times, is that five shots in one hour is a lot. You won’t feel any shots you take for 30 minutes after you take it at the very least, and it’s usually more like an hour. So if you’re not spacing your shots out, you’re gonna have a bad time when it all hits you. Best way to avoid this is to know that saying no to a shot really isn’t that big of a deal … [people] will forget about it in less than a second.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Young adults at this age haven’t fully developed critical decision-making parts of their brain yet, so it’s difficult to figure out if you’re really making the right decision if you are thrust into a neighborhood where there are little to zero authority or parental figures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 6 &amp; 7 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/","id":4658,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4657,4656,4655],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Motives for Recent I.V.

There were no known witnesses to the crime and no arrests have been made.</p>\n<p>Congregation leaders at St. Michael’s University Church said in a statement they believe the vandalism to be connected to the church’s recent decision to display signs in favor of LGBTQ rights and “Black Lives Matter” signs.</p>\n<p>“We are disappointed about this incident of vandalism on our church campus,” the statement reads. “[We] are especially concerned that it has occurred following the decision to display a rainbow flag and several ‘Black Lives Matter’ placards around the property.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, there is little for the department to say at this point in the investigation because of a lack of substantial evidence.</p>\n<p>“[The officers] searched the area but were not able to locate anyone connected to the crime and no arrests have been made in the case,” Hoover said in an email. “There were no known witnesses in the crime.”</p>\n<p>Church leaders said they also believe the unknown criminal may be struggling emotionally.</p>\n<p>“We suspect the person who did this is hurting and angry,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major Luke Bucklew said he believes the vandals were “not in their right mind” while causing the damage.</p>\n<p>“Maybe the people who did it were drunk or not in their right mind when they committed this act of hate and chaos,” Bucklew said. “I think it’s tragic that people in the city feel the need to vandalize property in whatever state of mind they’re in — inebriated or not.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/","id":4653,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4652,4651,4650],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Update: I.V.

Long-term residents, students and university and county officials voiced I.V. is at a critical turning point with many projects underway to improve safety and stability, and Plastino’s continued presence in I.V. would benefit the community.</p>\n<p>While the practice of the Sheriff’s department is to rotate IVFP leadership approximately every two years, individuals throughout I.V. believe Plastino’s role in projects such as training the recently appointed Community Resource Deputy (CRD) James McKarrell and preparing for the upcoming events of Halloween in the fall is important enough to lengthen the lieutenant’s term by a year or two.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he met with Sheriff Brown on Sept. 21, during which time the topic of an extension was discussed.</p>\n<p>“He expressed that he was not yet certain about how long I would remain in IV, although I think we all expect my assignment here to last at least through mid-April,” Plastino said in an email. “If I’m able to stay at least until April, I will be happy with that.  It was possible for me to move this past summer, so any additional time in IV is much appreciated.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said if he is replaced in April, he hopes he can provide input on a replacement for his position and spend time training the new lieutenant to ensure a smooth transition. Within IVFP, there is one patrol sergeant who could be promoted to lieutenant; otherwise Plastino’s replacement would come from a county-wide pool of current and future lieutenants, according to Plastino.</p>\n<p>“I do have a couple in mind that would do well here. I think personality and a desire to work with our very diverse population are very key criteria for any law enforcement manager in IV,” Plastino said in an email. “This also requires someone that is open to new ideas and is willing to break away from the standard models of policing.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he is both humbled by the community’s request that he remain in I.V. and grateful they value his role in the community.<br>\n“They are all people and organizations that care about our town and spend so much of their time to make this place wonderful.   I am truly touched that they would want me to stay and help them,” Plastino said in an email.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

mathematician Yitang Zhang will be joining UC Santa Barbara’s mathematics faculty this fall, a development many hope will add further prestige to the university.</p>\n<p>Zhang became famous in 2013 when he submitted a proof to the Annals of Mathematics which established the first finite bound on gaps between twin prime numbers, a feat many believed to be impossible. The New Yorker magazine published a profile on Zhang in February, and Filmmaker George Csicsery premiered a documentary on Zhang called “Counting from Infinity” in January. Zhang’s major breakthrough earned him numerous awards and honors, including the 2013 Ostrowski Prize, the 2014 Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory, election to the Academia Sinica fellowship in 2014 and tenure professorship at the University of New Hampshire in 2014.<br>\nUCSB mathematics professor and number theory specialist Jeffrey Stopple said it is unusual for mathematicians to be featured in The New Yorker.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably at this point one of the most famous mathematicians in the world,” Stopple said. “I think there might be only maybe two or three others alive that have his level of celebrity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he hosted Zhang’s visit to UCSB during a mathematics department colloquium in May and he personally invited Zhang to join the faculty as a professor.</p>\n<p>“I was honored to be able to host his visit to our campus and to invite him to become a professor, a colleague and a friend on our campus,” Yang said in an email.<br>\nAccording to UCSB professor emeritus in mathematics Martin Scharlemann, Zhang currently stands as one of the most prestigious professors at the university.</p>\n<p>“There are various types of prestige in mathematics. One is to be known by experts in your field and another is to be known by the general public,” Scharlemann said. “At least in the second category, he’s probably the most remarkable here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>UCSB mathematics department chair and professor Darren Long said he hopes Zhang’s presence in UCSB’s math department will increase the amount of interactions between professors and expand the department’s range of research.</p>\n<p>“This is not an enormous department, so we don’t have representation in every field possible,” Long said. “He is somebody that opens up a vista in that way.”<br>\nAccording to Stopple, hiring Zhang will significantly increase the university’s prestige and will attract even more students in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think it raises the profile of the campus enormously,” Stopple said. “In terms of recruiting new students at UCSB, I think at all levels people will want to be here.”</p>\n<p>Long said he offered Zhang a reduced teaching load to start, but assumes Zhang will want to increase it because of his extensive teaching history at the University of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p>“It is my impression that he will want to teach undergraduates from time to time,” Long said. “I expect he will succeed.”</p>\n<p>University of Massachusetts Boston mathematics professor and former University of New Hampshire’s mathematics department chair Eric Grinberg said Zhang has always been a humble faculty member, despite his worldwide fame.</p>\n<p>“He was always very modest and unassuming and he certainly never boasted of anything,” Grinberg said. “Even though he’s become world famous, I don’t think that’s changed too much.”</p>\n<p>Grinberg said students at the University of New Hampshire found Zhang’s teaching style to be “very much accessible” and “easy to follow.”</p>\n<p>“Some people might try to impress everybody by how deep their work is and get them lost in technicalities,” Grinberg said. “Yitang Zhang doesn’t do that.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said Zhang’s next goal is to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem, an important piece of a larger and more difficult problem called the Riemann Hypothesis, a 150 year-old mathematical conjecture with a one million dollar prize attached to it.</p>\n<p>“He sets his sights very high and I’m very impressed by him,” Stopple said. “Even the piece that he’s working on would make him famous all over again if he wasn’t already famous.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said it is unlikely Zhang will be able to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem during his time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“In some sense, it would be like someone being struck by lightning twice,” Stopple said. “It’s ambitious to try, but he’s the guy who’s willing to try stuff like that.”</p>\n<p>Yang said UCSB is an ideal place for Zhang to teach while also conducting research.</p>\n<p>“Our campus provides both the intellectual environment and spectacular beauty for him to enjoy continuing his research to solve unsolvable math problems while also teaching our students,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yitang Zhang was unavailable for comment.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015

id=\"caption-attachment-64716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>University of California Investment Office recently announced it divested nearly $200 million from coal mining and oil companies focused on tar sands while adding sustainability criteria to their investment portfolio.</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UC is a campaign organization comprised of students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members demanding UC divestment from all fossil fuel companies. The announcement to divest came after increased student pressure from a dozen schools following the May oil spill in Santa Barbara, preceded by three years of constant campaigning from Fossil Free UC.  Despite the partial victory, the University of California continues to invest in oil and gas industries involved in processes like the controversial method of hydraulic fracturing.</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UCSB Organizer and global studies graduate Theo LeQuesne said Fossil Free UC is a fossil fuel divestment campaign targeting the top 200 fossil fuel industries, discerned by the amount of carbon dioxide the companies release into the atmosphere. LeQuesne said divesting from the industries forces them to take responsibility for their environmental impact.</p>\n<p>“The reason we are targeting these industries is not necessarily that we think we can financially bankrupt them,” LeQuesne said. “The reason we want to do that is because they have assured themselves not to be responsible in terms of the public interest.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, fossil fuel industries lobby to block legislation targeting climate change, which motivates Fossil Free UC to continue the campaign advocating for divestment.</p>\n<p>“The fossil fuel industry has an enormous lobbying power and it’s really not okay for these people to uphold democracy and the way that politics are going at the moment,” LeQuesne said. “We will continue for divestment and we will be doing that for as long as it takes. We’re not going anywhere.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said the goal of Fossil Free UCSB is to change people’s perspective on the fossil fuel industry by educating the public on the industry’s tactics and impacts in person as well as online through social media.</p>\n<p>“We do this by having conversations with people at the arbor,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a long process, it’s one person at a time. By talking to people we encourage them to come to our meetings and get involved which is really a wonderful thing to see happening on campus.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said another goal is to reinvest the UC’s capital in more sustainable practices.</p>\n<p>“Once divestment occurs you have a lot of capitol to reinvest,” LeQuesne said. “We’re not just pushing for divestment, but putting that capitol to help benefit smaller communities and to help prevent climate change. It requires a different way of thinking of divestment.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, though the oil spill in Santa Barbara last May was damaging to the environment, it also united the UCSB community to demand the UC recognize its responsibility regarding the spill.</p>\n<p>“We had about 75 students demonstrating outside of Chancellor Yang’s office against UC investments,” LeQuesne said. “The UC has investments in Exxon mobile, for example, and Exxon Mobile’s oil was running through that pipeline that burst and endangered a whole bunch of wildlife.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said Fossil Free UCSB has been campaigning for three years and are excited to have won a “partial victory” through student involvement.</p>\n<p>“The recent victory is really testament that you can as a student make a difference through campaigning and activism and that is really exciting to see,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a shame that the recent divestment didn’t result in oil and gas, it was only coal and tar sands. It’s really a matter of time, I believe. It’s not an everyday occurrence.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Isaiah Swauncy said he thinks divestment will help the shift from fossil fuels towards more sustainable alternatives.</p>\n<p>“I think fossil fuels are definitely ruining the environment,” Swauncy said. “I think it’s a great idea and stepping stone for the rest of the U.S. However, until we find another energy source that can sustain the population we can’t completely stop using fossil fuels but the UC can help with divestment.”</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UC leader and UC Berkeley creative writing major Jake Soiffer said it is about time the UC began divesting from fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>“This is a hard-fought victory for students and our allies from across California who have been demanding the UC truly live up to its big talk on climate change,” Soiffer said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64731\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64731\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/","id":2699,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2698,2697,2696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AB 3 Heads to Gov.

F&amp;B) recently announced several new additions to its website for the upcoming year in an attempt to help facilitate the funding process for student groups.</p>\n<p>The A.S. F&amp;B, previously known as the A.S. Finance Board, is tasked with allocating annual student fees to help fund events and services of registered student organizations. Last year, the finance board was responsible for designating the spending of the Associated Students’ $10.9 million budget, $364,812 of which went to student organizations. The committee redesigned its website and logo this summer as part of its “rebranding” efforts.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Chairman and third-year history of public policy and political science double major Jerel Constantino said the new website will make it easier for student groups to request funding compared to the lack of “transparency” and “accessibility” in last year’s committee operations.</p>\n<p>“I felt like a lot of students didn’t really feel like we wanted to give their money back to them, which is kind of what our role is,” Constantino said. “We just want to get a new look. We want to make our brand everywhere just so that people know that this is the committee you go to to get funding and access to the fees, and part of that is redoing the website.”</p>\n<p>According to Constantino, one of the website’s new features is an online form for rollover requests and event reports, which he said could act as archives for students to use as references in future funding requests.</p>\n<p>“In the past, we’ve just relied on asking students, ‘How much money did we give you last year?’ but that’s not really accurate and there’s really not much record keeping in those regards,” Constantino said. “Since these forms are online now, any student will be able to look up just how much money this org spent and what they spent it on online.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Vice-Chair and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said confusion over policies and procedures repeatedly arose during last year’s funding processes.</p>\n<p>“When student groups were going through the funding process, a lot of the same questions kept popping up again about policies [and] procedures and what not,” Ninh said in an email. “This year, we’re aiming to solve that by providing guides and other resources that will increase clarity and give more detailed instruction so that the funding process is more efficient.”</p>\n<p>Constantino said the committee also hopes to allocate more funding to newer and smaller student groups rather than mostly funding events for larger organizations.</p>\n<p>“A large part of our funding has gone to organizations that already have a lot of funding — they can afford to fork over a few thousand dollars for their barbeque,” Constantino said. “I’d like to see more organizations, especially newer and smaller ones, being represented, to get their piece of the pie.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year computer science major Benji Lampel, who sought funding from the committee in the past for events like SB Hacks and Laughology, said the only improvement A.S. F&amp;B needs to make is increasing its financial visibility for student groups.</p>\n<p>“The only thing they could really improve on I think is making the funding easier to see when it’s distributed,” Lampel said in an email. “It was just hard to tell when the money was transferred and how much we actually got.”</p>\n<p>Ninh said A.S. F&amp;B plans to continue making events like SB Hacks possible.</p>\n<p>“So many of our students have really great ideas on how to give back to our community and enrich the student body as a whole,” Ninh said in an email. “I’m really looking forward to hearing them all, and my team and I are excited to make that happen.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The main message in the video ad centers on the letters “I.V.” and encourages viewers to keep I.V. safe by giving back to the community and living a life that makes you proud. The ad will be broadcasted on television in Santa Barbara County, Ventura County, Oxnard and San Luis Obispo County and also shared through social media.</p>\n<p>UCSB, SBCC and the city of Goleta each contributed $15,000 for the campaign and the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s office and the sheriff’s department each donated $5,000. I.V. Safe is comprised of government stakeholders and receives $10,000 annually in funding from Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County District Attorney and chair of I.V. Safe Joyce Dudley said the committee’s top priority is to rebrand I.V. and change its reputation.</p>\n<p>“The group said the most important thing is to change the image of Isla Vista,” Dudley said. “To take it away from being the party school where you come here, you abuse alcohol, drugs and the environment and take advantage of people, commit crimes.”</p>\n<p>According to Dudley, the committee is working with film director, writer and branding consultant Ken Berris on the campaign. Dudley said Berris’ daughter attended UCSB and Berris has previously collaborated with the university to create ads during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“He’s working very closely with UCSB and they came up with those Halloween ads,” Dudley said. “Everybody felt for the rebranding it was going to be positive … and those beautiful pictures in the background that were donated, he brought that back to the committee and we all liked it.”</p>\n<p>SBCC trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he believes rebranding should be done from the “ground up” by Isla Vistans and not by officials in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I’m not trying to demean the work of my colleagues … but I believe they made a mistake by not consulting the community,” Abboud said. “This is a very sterile ad, made from people in downtown Santa Barbara who hired a professional consultant to create an ad. That’s why I personally feel like it won’t work, because it doesn’t have that genuine feeling of the town doing it.”</p>\n<p>According to Berris, the ad targets locals in Santa Barbara, as well as students and their parents.<br>\n“The audience is going to be ideally everyone in Santa Barbara County, from students, to parents, to residents,” Berris said. “We want to start spreading this new communication about what we want I.V. to become again.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said the campaign is a “massive misstep” because it does not feature elected Isla Vistans.</p>\n<p>“They could use some prominent Isla Vistans in it and not elected officials and public officials from other cities,” Abboud said. “Maybe some of the younger looking people in the ad who look college-aged are Isla Vistans, but … we have a parks board of five people who live in Isla Vista. We have student elected leadership from A.S. None of them are in it.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said the campaign sets an expectation, and communicates to visitors certain behavior is not condoned in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If people see that’s what I.V. stands for, they’re not going to come here with the notion of destroying and thinking that the community itself is going to support the kinds of activities that have been going on there that negatively impacted public safety,” Dudley said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said few people will be exposed to the ad because many people are choosing mediums such as Netflix and Hulu over broadcasted television.</p>\n<p>“The majority of media consumed in Isla Vista is not through TV and cable TV in the traditional sense,” Abboud said. “A lot of people have transitioned to other sources like Netflix and Hulu, and this ad doesn’t seem like it would reach these people.”</p>\n<p>Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow said he appreciates I.V. Safe creating the ad, but a brief campaign will not have a large impact on the long-time established I.V. culture.</p>\n<p>“The image and quality of life in Isla Vista have been formed over the last 40 plus years (I lived there in the 70s),” Thurlow said in an email. “A media campaign on local television for one season will help but not have much impact. Having said that, we are appreciative of the District Attorney and Ken’s efforts.”</p>\n<p>According to Berris, efforts to rebrand I.V. will take several years.</p>\n<p>“Where we’re looking at this is year one,” Berris said. “You don’t rebrand a community or implement new techniques in one year. We’re looking at this as a five to seven year campaign.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said she will view the campaign as successful if it decreases the amount of crime and violence in I.V., and if not the committee may have to change its approach.</p>\n<p>“The way I’ll be interested in looking at it is did it reduce crime, did it reduce arrests, did it reduce injuries,” Dudley said. “If it’s during the time when these ads have had effect, then I think that’s terrific. If I’m not seeing a reduction in those kinds of things then I would think about other ways that we might want to redirect that fund.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he does not believe an ad will convince visitors not to come to I.V. or not to commit crimes during their stay.</p>\n<p>“If your ends are reducing crimes and reducing out of towners, this doesn’t seem like it meets those ends to me,” Abboud said. “I don’t know how an ad reduces crime, and I don’t know how an ad reduces out-of-towners. I think the people who come to Isla Vista to commit crimes are going to come regardless of an ad.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, I.V. Safe’s rebranding effort and exclusion of Isla Vistans in the conversation is not only ineffective but also disrespectful to those who live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“No other community would ever have an external government body impose an ad campaign to rebrand it anywhere else in the state or the country, that doesn’t happen,” Abboud said. “It happens very rarely with disenfranchised or disempowered communities and not to respected ones. It shows to me they don’t respect us very much if they’re going to not include us in the conversation 100 percent.”<br>\nDudley said she sees the campaign as a way to show the current status quo of I.V. rather than altering the image of it.</p>\n<p>“I see it as not so much a rebranding, as really shining a spotlight on where Isla Vista is right now,” Dudley said. “For lack of a better word, all the things that happened there have had a very sobering effect on the community. The community has come together where public safety is a high priority for the people that live there.”</p>\n<p>Berris said he believes any community can be rebranded given time and effort.</p>\n<p>“The campaign is essentially the communication tool that lets everybody know that we are changing I.V. back to the great community it was once,” Berris said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/","id":4655,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4654,4653,4652],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"DA Report Finds Police’s Actions Last May 23 To Be Lawful and in Self Defense","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"On Tuesday, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s (DA) Office stated law enforcement officers involved in the events of May 23 last year acted lawfully and in self defense during the gunfire ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Tuesday, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s (DA) Office stated law enforcement officers involved in the events of May 23 last year acted lawfully and in self defense during the gunfire exchange with suspect Elliot Rodger.</p>\n<p>Six UC Santa Barbara students were killed and 14 others injured in the shooting last year. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff Department’s investigation report concluded that Rodger engaged in two separate gunfire incidents with officers before he fatally shot himself. The report states Santa Barbara Sheriff Sergeant Brad Welch, Detective Brian Flick and deputies Adrian Marquez and Jorden Walker acted “in defense of others” and “in an attempt to arrest a dangerous felon.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff Department Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said the DA’s report found the police took proper action given the circumstances.</p>\n<p>“The report validates our agency’s belief that the deputies acted lawfully and properly,” Hoover said in an email. “We are grateful for the swift and resolute actions taken by our deputies which we believe saved the lives of many others.”</p>\n<p>Hoover said the deputies fired their guns at the suspect to prevent him from hurting more people.</p>\n<p>“The deputies were fired upon by a suspect who had already killed several people,” Hoover said in an email. “Their aim was to stop him, and by firing upon him, they accomplished that.”</p>\n<p>The report states the first officer-involved gunfire battle occurred at 9:32 p.m. at 6550 Del Playa Drive when Marquez returned one round after Rodger shot multiple rounds at Marquez from Rodger’s black BMW.</p>\n<p>“As the BMW quickly sped by westbound, Deputy Marquez fired one shot at the vehicle,” the report reads. “He was not able to determine if he hit the suspect. The forensic investigation later determined that his round hit the right side of the suspect vehicle.”</p>\n<p>According to the report, the second gun battle involved officers Welch, Flick, Walker and Johnson at Little Acorn Park. The officers fired numerous shots at Rodger and grazed his hip.</p>\n<p>“Fearing for their lives and the lives of their fellow deputies, and in an attempt to apprehend the suspect who had just killed at least three people and wounded dozens of others, Sgt. Welch, Detective Flick, and Deputy Walker fired at the vehicle,” the report reads. “Rounds hit the vehicle several times on the left side and rear, with only one confirmed round entering the vehicle.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and sociology double major Siavash Zohoori said he was riding his bike by the 7-Eleven when Rodger shot two of the bikers in front of him.</p>\n<p>“The whole time I kind of thought it was a gang shooting,” Zohoori said.</p>\n<p>Zohoori said one of the law enforcement officers fulfilled his duty by immediately running into the 7-Eleven where Zohoori was hiding after the bikers nearby him were shot by Rodger.</p>\n<p>“That was the most comforting and best thing in the world,” Zohoori said. “I think their actions that night served their purpose as officers to serve and protect. I’m really happy to say that they served and acted lawfully.”</p>\n<p>The report states the officers found Rodger in his BMW on Del Playa Drive with a through-and-through self-inflicted gunshot wound to his right temple.</p>\n<p>“Approximately one minute after the shooting in Little Acorn Park, the suspect vehicle crashed and the suspect shot himself in the head,” the report reads.</p>\n<p>The DA report states had it not been for the officers’ actions the night of May 23 last year many more lives would have been lost and the file on the investigation of the officer-involved shootings is now closed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64656\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64656\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/","id":4651,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4650,4649,4648],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SB County Planning Commission Finds an Increase in I.V.

Students and long-term residents attended the meeting to give input during public comment, all of whom rebutted the survey results. The event ended with the Commission promising to hold another meeting addressing the issue of parking in I.V. to better incorporate the community and for staff to develop a new survey.</p>\n<p>Planning and Development staff member David Lackey said the survey found 34 new parking spots due to elimination of designated red curb areas, new measurements, car share programs and overall reduced total vehicles.</p>\n<p>“It’s a combination of factors that concluded that the overall parking spaces that were available were actually increasing as the capacity has remained the same,” Lackey said.</p>\n<p>Second District SB County Planning Commissioner Cecilia Brown said there has been an increase in student population at UCSB and in I.V. since 2004.</p>\n<p>“But from what I understand, there has been a decrease in vehicles in that community,” Brown said. “Is that a fair statement?”</p>\n<p>Lackey said in terms of a “general trend,” certain demographics such as younger populations are not bringing single personal vehicles in the community.</p>\n<p>“That’s one of the many factors that were identified in the parking survey in 2013,” Lackey said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Associated Students (A.S.) representative Ethan Bertrand said overcrowding I.V. is unsafe and the community’s interests need to be taken into account when looking at I.V.’s future regarding parking.</p>\n<p>“There has been various outreach to the community, but I would say those have been ineffective and I would say we [the community] haven’t been provided with a chance to provide input and consideration to this,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) Chair Pegeen Soutar said IVRPD requests the I.V. Master Plan process be postponed and sent back to the community for review. Soutar also asked that IVRPD to be the lead agency to gather input from the community on all matters related to recreation and parks.</p>\n<p>“Since the Master Plan was first created, we find it to be inconsistent with the active community plan for our parks,” Soutar said. “It is very hard to find parking in Isla Vista at all. As far as your study, we cannot find parking at all. I’m not sure where that 15 percent paring is at folks, but we’re not finding it.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, it is very difficult to find coastal access parking in I.V., especially when people come from out of town for recreational activities.</p>\n<p>“We have excellent surf spots out there,” Soutar said. “And trust me, there are hundreds of people that when the surf is going, they want to come into town and that is a huge problem.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Sue Dickson said she wants amendments for the Master Plan to be postponed because the plan no longer accurately reflects community needs and does not address the density, parking and development issues in the current drought.</p>\n<p>“The Master Plan itself is flawed and out of date,” Dickson said. “A lot of change has taken place in Isla Vista since it has been originally written. Much of the report is no longer relevant. I did not receive any outreach.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Susan Wickham said she was not notified regarding meetings about the I.V. Master Plan.</p>\n<p>“You need to bring the community back into the conversation and let us have an opportunity to acknowledge the changes and the whole plan as it goes through the process,” Wickham said. “I believe the survey needs to be redone.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Maia said I.V. residents are double parking, parking nose to tail with no space in between, parking on dirt lots and in other people’s lots and that land owners are charging for parking.</p>\n<p>“Now it is summer and students are gone mostly. I’ve seen the fewest parking spaces in any of the summers,” Maia said. “There’s no places for visitors to go. This is our personal experience and surveys don’t necessarily reflect that. Why would landlords be charging for parking when there’s lot of spaces?”</p>\n<p>I.V. Project Committee Chair Teddy Warfield said it is not beneficial for those who are not residents of I.V. to create plans for the community.</p>\n<p>“I have to mention the arrogant and high-handed services your county staff has provided for the Isla Vista Master Plan Project and this process,” Warfield said. “I never received any notice that this process was going on. Your staff has served us poorly in this process.”</p>\n<p>UCSB A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs Paola DeLa Cruz said the survey is incorrect; there is no parking in I.V. and apartment complexes charge up to $300 for parking spaces, a fee many students cannot afford.</p>\n<p>“The information that you have in front of you is inaccurate and definitely does not address safety in Isla Vista,” DeLa Cruz said.</p>\n<p>First District SB County Commissioner C. Michael Cooney said community expectations are not being met, particularly concerns of the student body and long-term residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>“As an overall observation, I didn’t hear any support for our actions today,” Cooney said. “We have to emphasize to the Board of Supervisors that we need to look at the overall Master Plan through the eyes of the current Isla Vista, concerned Isla Vista population.”</p>\n<p>Third District SB County Commissioner Joan Hartmann said there needs to be more outreach in I.V. and increased community input to make a “reasonable” decision regarding parking.</p>\n<p>“I think we must ensure that people know what is happening and we need to do a better job. I’d like some assurances,” Hartmann said. “In terms of the parking, what we see here in the survey results is that there is enough parking but according to the community, that is not the case.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/","id":4652,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4651,4650,4649],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Pledges $1.4 Million to Isla Vista Self-Governance","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara announced through a letter of commitment this week that the university will fund $1.4 million to the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) if it is established.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara announced through a letter of commitment this week that the university will fund $1.4 million to the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) if it is established.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university pledged an annual $200,000 for seven years to the CSD</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s budget beginning in 2017, contingent on the passage of Assemblymember Das Williams</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) into law.

studies major Nicole Willard</p></div>\n<p>Their advice:</p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em>: What is the best piece of advice you can give a freshman moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh</em>: Bring only what you need and be mindful that you’re sharing the room. It’s helpful to communicate with your roommate(s) before moving in so you can organize who is bringing what and avoid possibly bringing two fridges!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> “Just do it!!” Shia LaBeouf hits the nail on the head with this statement when it comes to being involved. When you first move in, you will feel intimidated by the whole experience. But don’t coop yourself up in your room! Your dorm intentionally plans many programs the first week of move-in so you can be social and meet new people. You will have such a better experience when you put yourself out there, and you could possibly make lifelong friends! Don’t be afraid to introduce yourself and get to know other people.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki</em>: The best piece of advice I can give to a freshman moving into the dorms is to make an effort to get to know the rest of the people on your floor or building. Some of these people will be your best friends for life. Also, don’t forget to take it all in. Moving into your first college dorm can get pretty overwhelming, but as long as you remain optimistic and hopeful, you can definitely make the most of your time here.</p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What are some things freshmen often forget to pack when moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Get yourself some baby oil! Once you walk along the beautiful beaches of Santa Barbara, you will learn about the sticky tar that is almost impossible to get off of the bottom of your feet. Baby oil does the trick, and it will save you the pain of scrubbing those toes forever!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> Freshmen forget to bring air freshener! Sometimes those rooms get smelly and no one wants to be “that room.” I know a lot of freshmen also forget to bring business attire, for job interviews and such. Last thing, stamps!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What are some belongings freshmen often move in with that won’t be useful?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshmen definitely do not need to bring a printer since UCSB offers 200 free pages a quarter at various printing labs. Check out the free resources your campus offers!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Don’t bring clothes you don’t need! When you go visit your family for breaks, you can switch out clothes for the different seasons. This will give you so much more space for you and your roommates!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen who don’t participate in the “party scene” get involved?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> RAs work really hard to plan programs weekly for residents to who don’t want to party. Residents can suggest ideas and even organize the programs with their RAs. If freshmen want to get involved, there’s SO MANY leadership and volunteer opportunities at UCSB such as Hall Council, RHA, Associated Students and various interest clubs!<br>\n<em>Isozaki:</em> There are plenty of organizations on campus that are excited and welcoming to new first-year members, ranging from activist groups to cultural groups to dance teams to video game clubs. Finding a job is a great way to get work experience, make friends and stay active. It’s also very possible to be involved in the party scene without drinking or doing drugs. The campus climate of UCSB is not about who drinks the most, it’s about having a good time.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki: </em>There is so much you can do. I think there is a strong misconception that every single person parties at UCSB, it’s definitely not true. There are so many student organizations that you can get involved in. If you log onto orgsync.com you can find a huge list of the many clubs and organizations we have on campus. Many of the RAs create programs that will have alternatives to the party scene. You will have many opportunities that will cater to your needs and interests.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen learn to get along with their new roommate(s)?</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is super important to have an open and honest discussion in the first few days you are there. Set some ground rules, and stick to them. There have been too many instances where one roommate doesn’t like something the other roommate is doing so they go ask their RA to fix it for them. When that happens, I don’t intervene until I know they have talked to their roommate about it. Also, being passive aggressive doesn’t work! Don’t do it. If you have a problem, try to be an adult and find a solution yourself. Also, sometimes it is just easier to let the small things go. If you have a mutual understanding and follow the rules you set at the beginning of the year, everything should be fine.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> I think the main thing is just to have respect for one another. Having healthy communication and remaining transparent whenever it is necessary definitely promotes a positive living environment. Try to make an effort to get to know your roommate(s). I suggest to go to programs your RA plans together or find a place to eat in Isla Vista that you both have not tried yet.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What’s a common mistake freshmen often make?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshman should take advantage of the fresh new start that college gives them. They should reach out to others, be open-minded and try new things. The person you were in high school does not have to be the person you are in college. You literally can reinvent yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> Not buying a U-lock for one’s bike! We are a biking campus and having a U-lock helps keep your bike from getting stolen. Also, choose a major based on passion, not pay, because there are so many opportunities in every major to excel in great things.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> Are there any other tips you would like to share with the class of 2019?</p>\n<p><em>Hunyh:</em> Set some academic and personal goals for yourself before starting college. Think about what you really want to achieve by the end of your first year and work towards it! It’s not bad to get lost or go with the flow, but make sure you’re always working towards something great!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is imperative that freshmen learn time management and remember to not put off studying until finals week!
