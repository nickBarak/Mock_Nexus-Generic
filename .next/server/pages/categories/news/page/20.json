Bike Shop began its operations in 1974, working out of two corrugated steel shipping containers. The original facility had no running water or electricity, and structural decay posed threats to staff members and patrons, the report stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current building was created in 2008 to replace the shipping containers, adding plumbing and electricity and addressing the most shop’s critical needs. But what was meant to be a temporary solution has now been in place for over a decade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building’s downfalls are especially felt during the beginning of fall quarter, senior mechanic and fourth-year earth science major Estefania Franco said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have tons of supplies and especially when it comes to fall quarter, we get extremely busy and it’s kind of hard to help others in maintaining their bikes because we can’t house that many bikes here, which we do in case people don’t have time to stay with us until their repair gets done or if it’s a little bit [of a] longer repair,” Franco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The community keeps growing, but the shop stays in this constant space that doesn’t allow us to help out the growing community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current attempt to find a permanent space for the bike shop is not the first. Previous A.S. presidents have incorporated plans for the space into redesigns of the University Center (UCen). Most recently, in spring 2018, President Hieu Le introduced a ballot measure to pay for the UCen redesign that would include a dedicated space for the bike shop, but when students voted not to move forward with renovations, the bike shop plans fell through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until A.S. President Brooke Kopel, who served during the 2018-2019 academic year, took office that plans moved forward for a bike shop entirely separate from any other designs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel met last year with Mark Nocciolo, director of the Office of Budget and Planning, to discuss designs and locations. Nocciolo and Kopel intended to submit plans for the bike shop during spring of last year but were unable to when the last two campus planning committee meetings of the 2018-2019 year were cancelled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project has since moved forward into the current year, with current A.S. President Alison taking over for Kopel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They both have that sort of real conviction to get this done,” Nocciolo said. “And we’re doing all we can to make that happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Campus Planning Committee approved plans to move forward with the bike shop during its Oct. 30 meeting and now plans to hire an architect to move forward with design and location plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The committee for the bike shop’s permanent location is a collaboration with Sir, Nocciolo, others in the Campus Planning Committee, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and employees at the bike shop. The committee created a list of space needs for the building and new location, including bike path accessibility, a garage door, a safer location for test riders than the current parking lot, increased indoor space and bike-specific storage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Campus Planning Committee has opened the search to 11 sites, which may increase when an architect is hired, the bike shop identified four locations they would prefer: by the Thunderdome, by the Student Affairs Building, by the UCSB bus loop and in the Old Gymnasium Building. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of these four, Franco expressed that the Thunderdome is the preferred location of bike shop employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It already has some good plumbing and electricity situations, which would make it really ideal, especially because since it is on campus, it would make a really easy kind of for everyone since it belongs to the school,” Franco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the bike shop supports the Thunderdome location, Nocciolo has purposefully kept the location list open instead of recommending one for the Campus Planning Committee at this stage in the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our project proposal, we included all the sites that we looked at, and we did that so that the committee would recognize that this is a process that is going to have more than one set of eyes looking at it. We felt as if it made more sense for the committee to see the array of possible sites rather than saying it’s this site or that site or this other site,” Nocciolo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Nocciolo saw the immediate importance of a permanent shop location, he believes architects and the Campus Planning Committee must take into account the long-term growth of the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are instrumental in this activity; we will definitely want to have a committee involved, and students are always a part of these things. Student funds — they need to have a say. But we also need to have our eye on the long-term interests of the institution. We have a long range development plan that is going to live beyond us,” Nocciolo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want it to be in a place that makes sense for the long term so that it is indeed permanent and that we’re not asking to have it moved again. We don’t want to forego any future development that would be really important to the academic program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is also currently discussing master circulation of pathways, sidewalks, bike paths and roadways, according to the report, so Nocciolo doesn’t want any current bike shop plans to get in the way of other development projects in the works. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that an architect has been hired, Nocciolo says it is a “realistic goal” to have the project approved by the Campus Planning Committee by the end of the academic year, so construction can commence during the summer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For bike shop employees like Franco, the change can’t come soon enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The bike shop should grow as the community of biking grows. We see more and more students come in with bikes every year, but [our current location] is slowly limiting the amount of people we are able to help.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

400;\"> </span><em>Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the Mustangs brought an aggressive push that resulted in an early lead, one that UCSB ultimately was unable to overcome. The final score was 11-2, with the Mustangs taking home the championship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came here to play with some of the best people around and improve my game,” said Miguel Del Real, a second-year student at Cal Poly hailing from Santa Cruz. Del Real has been playing beer die since his sophomore year in high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s my second year coming here, and you know, Santa Barbara’s kind of the place to be for this stuff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tournament, held at the Kappa Sigma fraternity sand pit, drew a large number of players and spectators. Its host, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dyeislife, was founded in 2015 by Tanner Guisness, a marketing major who studied at the University of Colorado Boulder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guisness said he began playing beer die in his sophomore year of college and discovered his passion for the game through his time in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After graduation, Guisness started an Instagram page </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> @dyeislife </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which grew rapidly as he went from college to college and currently boasts over 91 thousand followers. Now, Dyeislife is a business that he runs with his partner Jack Hagerty, a former SBCC student, that manages die beer die tournaments across the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guisness primarily manages tournaments at East Coast colleges such as Penn State and Clemson University while Hagerty handles the majority of the northern California events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just spreading the gospel of die across the country,” Hagerty said. “We just want to teach the kids what’s good. I mean, look at this energy, it’s so electric.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My goal is to have every backyard set up with a die table,” Guisness added. “Sand, astro, turf? Doesn’t matter, man, I just want kids playing this game. A lot of people think it’s bad because people are drinking, but hey, better beer than chugging a whole handle by yourself, you know what I mean?

Beautiful blue skies, tons of dudes, tons of beer and tons of die sports.

CSD), because it is a public entity to provide officers for any large event, regardless of any separate private security hired for the event, according to Brandt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but the district would like to minimize the police presence at the festival, he said, as simply seeing officers in uniform could be potentially unsettling for people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The truth is that cracking down and forcing and arresting and ticketing our way of public safety is not possible,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That just drives a wedge between law enforcement and the community and we can’t go down that road again. We saw what happened in 2014, there was a riot and we can’t go back to that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman called the proposed contract with SBSO — which he said could potentially raise costs for the district </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “an endless pit of liabilities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contract includes an “indemnification” clause, which would require the I.V. CSD to agree to “indemnify, defend and hold harmless [the] COUNTY … against any and all claims, actions, losses, damages, and/or liabilities,” according to the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman raised concerns that should a situation arise in which the SBSO would need to bring in more officers, costs would rise for the I.V. CSD. However, according to G. Ross Trindle, district counsel for the I.V. CSD, the possibility is very low for a situation in which the I.V. CSD would be at fault for the actions of SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director George Thurlow also mentioned concerns from SBSO leadership about the timeline of putting together the festival. At the I.V. Safe Task Force meeting held earlier that day, he said SBSO leadership did not believe that holding the festival this year “is the right path to take.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[SBSO’s] position on this is ‘wait until next year. It’s too soon and there’s plenty of time for us to get on the same page,’” Thurlow said at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contract negotiations have been ongoing for over </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/i-v-csd-considers-turning-deltopia-into-a-sanctioned-festival/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a month</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now; the proposal was originally brought to the I.V. CSD in early October. Sara Marvel, director for Lucidity LLC, emphasized a month ago the importance of approving the contract in a week to get all the moving pieces ready in time for spring.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Half of the board seemed to be seriously considering the possibility of pushing the festival until 2021, although Brandt was adamant that appropriate adjustments could be made to the contract in time for it to be passed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman stressed the timeliness of the contract as well, adding that pushing the festival to the following year would give the board more time to finalize contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A month ago we had a meeting and we were talking about these contracts and how we’re going to handle it. It was, essentially, if you don’t get the contract done right now, we won’t have enough time and that was a month [ago] and we still don’t have the contract done, it’s not going to happen until weeks from now,” Freeman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just don’t think we’re able to pull this off right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janet, a resident of I.V. for eight years who attended Tuesday’s meeting, echoed Freeman’s thoughts, stating that she believed that changing the culture around Deltopia could not be done in a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So as far as the goals go, which is to change the atmosphere of Deltopia, it has to be a multi-year project. It’s not going to happen in one year. You have to think out a little bit farther because it will be a gradual process,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Fischer said this policy affects a few streets in Santa Barbara, some in Goleta and every street in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students like Joy, it was a shock to learn they would not be able to park their oversized vehicles in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be disappointing if they started enforcing [the ordinance] in I.V. to kick out students and others who literally can’t afford rent, and live in a van by necessity,” Joy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the College Affordability Town Hall on Oct. 11 students asked Supervisor Joan Hartmann how the ordinance would affect students who live in their vehicles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [aren’t] students but tend to be other homeless adults,” she replied, explaining that the situation in 2013 – before the passing of the ordinance – saw a number of oversized vehicles parked in I.V. that were not owned by students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the issue of housing insecurity is not limited to non-student adults </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2017, the UC Global Food Initiative found that 5% of UC undergraduate and graduate students experienced housing insecurity at some point in their enrollment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average rent for an apartment in I.V. is $2,131, according to Rentcafe.com, a rental site which compiles rental market trends.

It’s not even an option for me,” she told the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCSB Sustainability Coordinator Katie Maynard, the UC system has launched a Rapid Rehousing program to address housing insecure and houseless students; UCSB now receives $415,000 a year to assist housing-insecure and houseless students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Financial Crisis Response Team can place eligible students who are currently houseless or about to become houseless in bridge housing within 24 to 48 hours, after which the team will work with the student to help them find stable housing moving forward,” Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the program can also provide “awards” to students to help if “they have difficulty paying rent and need financial support to stay in their current housing.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91253\" style=\"width: 318px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91253\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91253\" data-attachment-id=\"91253\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0317\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91253\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=308%2C410\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Nadia Abushanab</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for some, the decision to move into a vehicle may not be motivated by finances. Both Wiese and Joy said that while their decisions to move into their vehicles were partially due to the financial benefit of not paying rent, they also said they wanted to experience more freedom, be able to travel more easily and learn to live more simply. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Santa Barbara municipal code, all oversized vehicles parked overnight are subject to a $50 minimum fine and possible removal. However, Alissa Hazard, a traffic engineer for the County of Santa Barbara, said that vehicles have previously only been cited when an I.V. resident files a complaint with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Wiese’s school bus is oversized, she has not yet been cited or towed as of mid-October. She has, however, had multiple negative interactions with I.V. residents, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[A resident] yelled at me a couple of times … he [said], ‘If you’re not out of here by sunset, I’m calling the cops on you!’ … He said that us van-dwellers make the neighborhood a shithole,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has also had conflicts with the IVFP. “They would wake me up at 3, 4 a.m., banging on my door, shining lights in the windows, yelling at me to get out,” she recounted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fischer emphasized that the ordinance only restricts oversized vehicles </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as Wiese’s school bus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but not regular-sized vehicles. She encourages those who are living in oversized vehicles to enroll in the Safe Parking Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cassie Roach, a UCSB alumnae now working for the Safe Parking Program in Santa Barbara, the program is meant to not only provide immediate overnight safety, but also to connect houseless folks to other community resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We partner a lot with the food bank … we also have our own food bank once a month; we try and get people connected to free showers, making sure people are signed up for food stamps, have health insurance [and] are signed up for different subsidized-housing waiting lists,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach estimates that around 10% of their clients are students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wiese said that when she has been moved by police officers, they often referred her to the Safe Parking Program. However, she said the regulations of the program have stopped her from pursuing this option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not ideal for someone who has irregular schedules, who is either going to school or working. A lot of people who live in their vehicles are working and go to school. It’s not like they’re just sitting around all day,” Wiese said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach emphasized that the regulations of the Safe Parking Program are not meant to make people’s lives more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not meant to be this overbearing, strict program that’s going to have rules that they have to follow and just make life harder. It’s meant to be a supportive safe space for them, and we do want to work with all of our clients to see how we can best support them moving forward,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be a resource for students. We want to be supportive and helpful.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:01 a.m.]: Joy uses they/them pronouns.

will soon rule on the legality of the program. </span><em>Jessica Ko / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the direction of UC President Janet Napolitano, the UC Regents filed a lawsuit in September 2017 challenging President Trump’s announcement that he would end the program and took its stance as a defender of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a UC-wide service to help undocumented students: the UC Immigrant Legal Services Center. Based out of UC Davis, the program places an attorney at each UC campus who is available for legal assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the legal assistance, each UC has set aside resources for undocumented students, each with a program tailored to the needs of their respective campus. At UC Santa Barbara, this support comes from the Undocumented Student Services (USS). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, located on the second floor of the Student Resource Building,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was officially established in 2014 through funding from the Office of the President set aside specifically for undocumented student services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diana Valdivia, coordinator for Undocumented Student Services, works with seven student interns to help undocumented students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been working around undocumented students for five years, and prior to that I was organizing DACA legal clinics,” Valdivia said. “The passion of working with immigrant communities and having a masters in student affairs when these positions opened up were part of the reason for my interest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia has seen exponential growth in undocumented student services over the past three years in particular — both from overall growth of the new program as well as from heightened concerns from immigrant students when it was announced in 2017 that DACA would be rescinded, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When DACA was rescinded… we were seeing students [come in and] worry about, ‘What does that look like?’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia’s goal with Undocumented Student Services is to provide a “different narrative” for the greater campus about what it means to be undocumented. Last year, USS hosted seven separate trainings for people to learn about laws and policies impacting immigrant communities, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, each year during the third week of winter quarter, the center puts on an annual Immigration Awareness Week on campus, where it hosts a series of events to provide outreach about how to support the UCSB immigrant community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The services also offer a faculty mentorship program, which connects undocumented students to other students and faculty members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have socials for students, and then faculty also come to the socials, and then students get a chance to interact with them more in an informal mentor role,” Valdivia explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia sees the connection between undocumented students and the greater UCSB population as beneficial to everyone, particularly as the Supreme Court goes through the DACA hearings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the times media might be focusing on the trauma, what it means to be undocumented and that’s totally valid,” Valvidia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s important] for us to be able to provide a different narrative.”</span></p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

contracted employees was passed by the UC Regents (pictured at an earlier meeting).</span> <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policy comes on the heels of intense backlash from unions in response to the UC’s outsourcing practices. On Wednesday, workers represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME 3299) held their sixth strike in two years after the union filed <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-06/afscme-files-six-new-unfair-labor-practice-complaints-against-uc-plans-to-strike-nov-13/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573718186508000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0IXQTx92iJhsPGSRrVXxo8SDUoQ\">six unfair labor practice complaints</a> against the UC in early November. A majority of the complaints addressed the UC’s alleged use of “secretive” contracts to outsource labor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the news of a policy aimed to internalize a majority of the UC’s workforce, AFSCME is not yet convinced this policy will clear the air on the alleged workforce offenses the UC has committed in the past. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the last several years, thousands of UC service and patient care workers have stood together to expose the university’s unfair, unsafe and often illegal outsourcing of UC jobs. Now, after years of dismissing the problem and the racialized inequality it creates, the Board of Regents is finally acknowledging the need to change course,” the union said in a statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A “policy” isn’t worth the paper its [sic] printed on unless it is actually enforced… UC’s abysmal track record makes clear that only state legislation or binding contract language can deliver the accountability that’s needed to uplift UC’s most vulnerable low wage workers and to stop the university from outsourcing more jobs,” the union continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/nov19/g2attach.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573719471565000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKJ1q3jBL_aDWK9Uf3jxQEf96lZw\">policy</a> would cover all campuses and affect a substantial amount of contractible services, such as custodial, food, healthcare and transportation services. No official date for the policy’s implementation has been set, but guidelines to roll out the policy would be established “no later” than Jan. 31, 2020, according to the policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the umbrella of the new policy, the UC is allotted few instances in which outsourced labor will be permitted: if the services are needed in an emergency, if the UC is unable to provide the required equipment or personnel internally, if the services are related to property transactions, if the services would be more convenient to contract out or if services provided by “registry personnel in clinical operations” are not sufficient enough to respond to “staffing needs,” according to the policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policy also offers contracted workers, who often work for lower wages and with fewer benefits, an opportunity to be adopted by the UC as university employees if the requirements for their employment are met. In turn, the “in-sourcing” of contracted employees will provide them with the full wages and salaries offered by the UC, according to the policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Individuals employed by service contractors who have provided those services to the University on a continuous basis for 12 months or more may request to be converted to University employment,” the policy continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the intake of contracted workers, employees under “covered services” — contracted services that are qualified to remain outsourced — are mandated by the new policy to be provided with “wages and benefits that are equivalent to the University wages and benefits provided to University employees performing the same work,” the policy read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, according to the policy, should “covered services” displace university employees, the university is required to open another position of a similar nature, which must “be in the same bargaining unit and at the same campus, medical center, or Laboratory” and provide matching wages and benefits corresponding to the displaced position.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, the new policy is expected to incur roughly an additional $108 million in costs for the UC, as stated at the meeting; the number was calculated by factoring in the cost of supplementing contracted work for insourced work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Richard Leib commented on the policy at Wednesday’s Governance Committee meeting, predicting that the UC, as the third largest employer in California, may encounter difficulty implementing the policy as “there are certain administrative tasks that are going to make it difficult for our campuses who are under a lot of other pressures.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, he maintained that implementing the policy will better reflect the values of the UC and those who work for it.“This is the right thing to do,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the prospect for better employment opportunities, wages and benefits through the policy, Todd Stenhouse, communication director for AFSCME, said the union was still doubtful. Stenhouse said three bills passed through the California Legislature between 2015 and 2017 — SB 574, 959and 376 — all of which attempted to “ensure commensurate pay between contractors and employees who do the same job.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC “very publicly and vocally” lobbied to kill the three bills, all of which were vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown, Stenhouse said. Decisions like these pose a significant threat to employees, he said, especially those where financial insecurity constantly looms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are not individuals that can afford to say, ‘Hey, you know, I’m good without a day’s pay,’” Stenhouse said. “These are people that don’t make a lot of money as it is. They see the pain and the harm and the insecurity that these practices have allowed to fester.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Stenhouse sees the policy as a sign of “progress” to AFSCME, the new policy “is hardly a finish line.” Stenhouse wants to see the UC keep its word and carry out on procedures that have been long overdue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a matter of concern across the state. We’re talking about communities across California. We’re talking about thousands of very vulnerable workers who are effectively doing the same jobs in many cases, full time, in many cases for years on end,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A first-class university does not have second-class workers. It is certainly high time for the University of California to not only talk the talk but to walk the walk.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Update [Nov. 15, 5:50 p.m.]: This article has been updated to include information about the full Regents’ vote on Thursday. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The workers set up their base at Storke Tower but spent much of the day marching around campus in order to draw attention to the union’s demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME 3299 — which represents more than 24,000 health care and service employees across the UC system — has been embroiled in contract negotiations with the university for the past two years, and one of its primary demands has been an end to outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This strike was AFSCME 3299’s sixth at UC campuses across the state in the past two years — a point of frustration among many of the workers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a custodian at UCSB and an AFSCME 3299 member, said that he was “disappointed” with the number of strikes but added that he felt the only way the university will change its behavior is if the union keeps striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that we’re out here again on unfair labor practices has me a little disappointed about making and impact on the way they follow the rules, but I think the only way that we’re ever going to make a change on that is by keep coming out,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paco Garcia, a senior lead laborer in facilities management at UCSB and an AFSCME member, added that union workers “don’t make the cost of living.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t make enough money to live in Santa Barbara, they don’t make enough to go on with their lives, they have to take two jobs,” Garcia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Outsourcing is causing people to not have a steady job; it’s causing people to not live at the cost of living, and we want the university to stop breaking the law,” Garcia added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents is currently considering a motion that — with a few exceptions — would prohibit outsourcing and adopt contracted workers to the UC’s payroll if they have been working for the UC for over a year. On Wednesday night, the UC Regents Governance Committee approved the motion; it will now move on to the Board of Regents for a vote. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91267\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/ucs-largest-union-strikes-for-the-third-time-this-year/afscme_ida-kazerani_online_9/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91267\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91267\" data-attachment-id=\"91267\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/ucs-largest-union-strikes-for-the-third-time-this-year/afscme_ida-kazerani_online_9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AFSCME_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE_9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91267\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME 3299 filed six complaints against the UC on Nov. 1, which primarily alleged unfair labor practices such as outsourcing and accused the university of cutting costs by contracting with private companies to do work which could be done by union workers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It saves money for [the university] because they don’t have to pay for pensions, they don’t have to pay for benefits, the contractors that they’ve contracted out with have lower pay,” said Babe Gonzalez, an AFSCME member who works as a medical assistant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">majority</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of outsourcing has been at medical centers on campuses like UC San Francisco and UC Los Angeles, rendering UCSB a school where outsourcing has a relatively smaller impact, Gonzalez added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, much of the outsourcing is in custodial work, which Garcia said could be performed by staff. AFSCME uses strikes as a bargaining tool, he added — the strike forces the university to hire more people to replace the strikers, which in turn provides the UC incentive to listen to the union’s demand that they end illegal outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite AFSCME’s insistence that the strikes are about the illegal outsourcing complaints, UC Office of the President spokesperson Andrew Gordon called the strike a strategy to gain “leverage in negotiations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon added that the union ultimately wants double the wages of other employees and said AFSCME 3299 utilizes the strikes as a mechanism to achieve that goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Despite union concerns about contracting, the number of AFSCME-represented employees has actually grown by double digits in the past five years,” Gordon said. “UC’s contracts with AFSCME protect employees from displacement due to contracting, and no employee can be terminated as a result of a subcontracting decision.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike saw a degree of student solidarity, such as from Wendy Santamaria, a fourth-year political science and philosophy major, who attended the strike alongside her fellow Students for Bernie organization members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I see it as absolutely crucial for us as students to come together with workers,” Santamaria said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As long as we keep spreading knowledge of the issues workers are facing, [support for the strike] is going to continue to grow,” she added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the student support, external groups such as hip-hop duo Rebel Diaz, a Chicago-based group that was on campus Wednesday to </span><a href=\"https://z-m-www.facebook.com/events/990558504623313/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">perform</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at a separate event, marched through campus with the strikers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know that the struggles they’re fighting for are not just about wages but about this idea of an entire system becoming privatized and the outsourcing of jobs and services that should be publicly funded,” said Rodrigo “RodStarz” Venegas, who is half of Rebel Diaz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez emphasized that “we all want the same thing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all want to make sure that we have a job tomorrow,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yu</em></a></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to suspend the spring study abroad program was made now to ensure that students who were planning to study abroad in Hong Kong will be able to transfer to a different program or coordinate housing and classes at their home campuses if they choose to stay in the U.S., Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We felt that rather than have them go, potentially be in an unsafe situation and have to worry about evacuating them… it would be preferable to not have them go,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray added that the program is keeping a close eye on the protests in order to gauge whether to evacuate the students currently studying abroad in Hong Kong. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are currently 79 UC students in Hong Kong taking courses through the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), seven of whom were scheduled to stay in Hong Kong for the full academic year. In addition to those seven students, 12 other students were expected to study abroad in Hong Kong in the spring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said there were originally 90 students scheduled to go to Hong Kong in the fall, but after UCEAP offered them the option to switch programs or postpone their studies abroad due to the protests, 11 students chose to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been monitoring the situation since the summer,” Nyitray said. “So this wasn’t a decision that was either made lightly or out of any kind of haste or panic.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As the protests again continued to escalate further, and the response has been so unexpectedly strong from the police, with people being shot at with live ammunition, we felt that we really needed to evaluate this very, very carefully,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said the program’s first priority was ensuring the safety of UC students who are currently in Hong Kong, all of whom are attending one of three schools: University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Two out of our three partners [University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong] are now actually sites of protests and violence, and the faculty and staff are having difficulty getting to campus if they live at any distance because of the transit systems being shut down,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-students.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=fb-nytimes&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ns3WNd1rmpfZ_NDQBZQI4oY-yHNZkQC9rWNLSD_2JqDKVaRf8RZeXIZw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Wednesday that police in Hong Kong had begun “raiding the edges of the biggest campuses to make arrests.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday night, police officers and students clashed near the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong; “police officers fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets and students hurled Molotov cocktails and bricks, and practiced firing bows with flaming arrows,” according to the Times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said that while it hasn’t reached the point where UCEAP will “actively evacuate” students currently in Hong Kong, students have been given the option to end their programs early and return home. UCEAP and its partner universities in Hong Kong have been working with students to ensure they will receive course credit for their terms, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She explained that as the protests escalated, there were “a number of [non-UC universities] who didn’t send students this fall at all,” while others have now “pulled [students] back and have simply told them ‘you must come back now.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But because the UCEAP program is unusual in that it has such a large number of students, “we really wanted to not just jump in, we wanted to really assess the situation and give the students optimal chance to remain, to have the academic experience that they wanted to have, before we pulled out,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also added that if students were sent to Hong Kong in the spring and had to be evacuated, they might not be able to receive credit for the classes they were taking or be able to enroll in time at their home campuses for the quarter or semester. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re trying to balance the academic and the financial consequences for the students, you know, we don’t want any of the students to suffer at all,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP has not determined if they will suspend the Hong Kong summer abroad programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just so unclear — it’s unclear to our partners, it’s unclear to us,” Nyitray said. “We’ve been monitoring the State Department updates every day, and we have been monitoring local news, not only the foreign news, but local news, and of course we have our partners on the ground.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray noted that the State Department security level for Hong Kong is level two, or “exercise increased caution,” which she said was the same security level as most of Western Europe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With the violence and the protests having moved to the campuses themselves, we feel that the situation warranted extra caution.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

It calls on the UC to end the use of all Proposition 65 herbicide on the campus, and asks the university to “notify students, faculty, and staff before any synthetic herbicides are sprayed at UCSB and in surrounding areas, including location and time details.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution many of the synthetic herbicides used by the UC </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as glyphosate, oryzalin and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are considered by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer to be probable carcinogens, meaning long-term exposure to such chemicals could be detrimental to human health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states there have been a considerable number of court cases in California ruled that glyphosate-based herbicides had caused cancer, referencing one where, in August 2018, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco Superior Court jury in the Dewayne Johnson v. Monsanto case found that glyphosate-based herbicide exposure was responsible for the plaintiff’s terminal cancer.

A student can submit reports of sexual misconduct — anonymously or not — either online, over the phone, via email or in person; the office will then establish a case file and reach out to the student in order to explain how they can move forward with the case, Alvarez explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that can only happen if the complainant responds to the office’s follow up, she emphasized, explaining that if students submit through an anonymous report and provide scarce information, it can severely limit the office’s ability to continue a case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes we just have a first name. Sometimes we just have very general information about what happened,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it seems that we have insufficient information, meaning not enough information to move forward with one of those response options, then we may proceed with closure. That doesn’t mean we can’t reopen [the case] when we receive new information in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alia Reynolds, president of Students Against Sexual Assault, emphasized to the panel and attendees that communication between the university and students needs to be open at all times “without students having to ask for that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think students need access and communication of this information continuously and constantly, versus sending out updates on everything that’s been done after the fact,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students pressed the panel for answers on what the university is going to do moving forward regarding the allegations against Sigma Pi.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have answered [with] appropriate actions to take once the investigation is complete,” one student said. “With all due respect, I believe you still haven’t answered the question about what actions are being taken now against these fraternities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and Office of Student Life (OSL) director, said that as soon as the OSL members heard of multiple allegations against fraternities in I.V., they held a meeting with the Interfraternity Council (IFC) to have a “long and very open dialogue about our very explicit concerns about the reports that we had received.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have answered [with] appropriate actions to take once the investigation is complete… With all due respect, I believe you still haven’t answered the question about what actions are being taken now against these fraternities.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The IFC council made a decision immediately in that room… to create a self-imposed moratorium on social events. They originally imposed that for four days, and after that period they reassessed and decided to institute it indefinitely while ongoing discussion and internal rulemaking and conversations with the university administrators and advisors continued,” Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn added that the IFC’s ban on parties was just one step in creating a safer environment for students, but another student pointed out that the moratorium would only cut off the liquor and leave the root cause ignored.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We’re] saying we don’t want to have parties in these houses where people are going to be unsafe,” Klawunn said. “We believed that not having social events in those houses until we could put some safe steps into place was the right direction, and so that’s where we stand.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students voiced similar concerns about the university’s Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) initiative, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sexual assault defense training program offered through the UC Police Department</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One student emphasized that getting to the underlying cause of the sexual assaults should be the university’s primary focus, rather than creating defense programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems that the R.A.D. training is the only tangible outcome of what we’ve heard going on  campus, and it seems as though [it’s saying] ‘Let’s train women to defend themselves’ instead of ‘Let’s get to the root of the problem,’” the student said. “There’s a culture, there’s a problem with these criminals out there who are doing this who think it’s okay — and they’re getting away with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eli Diaz, a second-year pre-economics and accounting major, also voiced his concerns over the language used in the timely warnings, particularly over the word “victim.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I heard Ariana, the Title IX officer, use the word ‘victim’ to refer to survivors and I feel like it’s been widely accepted that ‘victim’ isn’t the right word to use for people that are survivors of sexual violence. That felt like a strong disconnect, especially coming from someone that is from Title IX,” Diaz said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock explained to forum attendees that the university must be careful when it comes to the use of the term “survivor” compared to “victim” or a neutral term such as “complainant.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we’re trying to hold someone accountable, it actually puts us in a less credible position to use the term ‘survivor.’ We are expected to be neutral, and if our investigators are making this linguistic assumption of the truth, it actually degrades the credibility of the case of the investigation when it goes before a hearing or a trial,” Ashlock said during the forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn further mentioned that in the immediate future, the Task Force for Safer Social Events — an ongoing project organized by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, Associated Students President Alison Sir and Klawunn — will attempt to bring organizations from all over the community, including IFC, the OSL and the Isla Vista Community Services District, among others, to enact change for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, one student believed that allowing IFC to take part in the task force could lead to a bias in the task force’s actions, referring back to the self-imposed moratorium. Armistead countered by stating that not including IFC would be counteractive to the change trying to be made. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here’s the thing, if we’re going to make change, we’ve got to make change all over. And I think it can be really dangerous to not include any entity,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important that we all work together as a community to make some really positive change. I’m not comfortable not having IFC nor any group on this task force. We </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have to</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work together to make change.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The designation, which is valid for the next four years, recognizes UCSB’s efforts in creating an environment that fosters safe and accessible bike riding while encouraging students to switch to bicycles for transportation, according to the League of American Bicyclists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Bicycle Friendly University program evaluates applicants’ efforts to promote bicycling in five primary areas: engineering, encouragement, education, enforcement and evaluation/planning, known as the Five E’s,” the </span><a href=\"https://bikeleague.org/university\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">League’s website states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the first year that UCSB has been designated as such, and it joins the other seven institutions — including UC Davis and UC Irvine  — that have been awarded the same designation of Platinum-level Bike Friendly Universities (BFUs). In 2011 and 2015, UCSB received the less prestigious Gold-level distinction, according to the League. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amelia Neptune, a representative from the League of American Bicyclists, said in an email to the Nexus that there were “a few weaknesses” from UCSB’s 2015 application, which is why the university was not awarded a Platinum distinction before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[There was] </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the lack of bike share at the time (there was a program but it had five bikes total, as opposed to the 650-bike HOPR program that now exists) and the poor quality of many of the bike racks on campus, which have been upgraded or are still in the process of being upgraded and/or expanded,” Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The significant changes made over the last few years, including the addition of new biking paths and bike parking spots, led to UCSB achieving the new award, Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A major factor in UCSB earning Platinum this year [is] the outcomes they were able to show: 43% of students who live off campus use a bike to commute to campus, which is huge compared to what most schools see,” Neptune said. </span><b> </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the new improvements build upon the deep-rooted bike culture that has been present on campus for decades, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The presence of dedicated bike infrastructure, including 20,000 bike parking spots, 9 bike-only roundabouts, 3 bike-only underpasses, and the network of dedicated bike paths throughout the campus, [is] also a major factor [for the Platinum BFU designation].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamey Wagner, manager of the Transportation Alternatives Program, said that UC Santa Barbara began to develop its bicycle system in the 1960s, stating that the campus has “continued bicycle infrastructure innovation for over 50 years” and that the A.S. Bike Shop has been in operation for over 45 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wagner added that the HOPR Bike Share program, which launched at UCSB in 2018, has seen significant improvement since 2015, when UCSB was last assessed as a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most recent data shows that, with the addition of hundreds of shareable bikes, the HOPR program now has 1000 semi-regular users, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, in the last four years, the UCSB Sustainability Program has been partnering with the A.S. Bike Committee to provide bike safety training and bike-lot clearing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student initiatives played the largest role [in achieving platinum status], this was aided by the diversity in spaces such as the Associated Students Bike Committee and the A.S. Bike Shop</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Wagner explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neptune added that over the past year, the Sustainable Transportation Committee has been working on a master transportation plan for the campus, which includes improvements to bike infrastructure. This plan was included in UCSB’s application to become a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new bike plan promises changes and improvements to infrastructure on campus and in I.V., Mo Lovegreen, director of sustainability on campus, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are still in the process of drafting this plan and it will take us the bulk of this academic year to complete it but the idea is that it would help AS BIKES identify areas that need improvement and provide a list of items that need to be addressed,” Lovegreen explained in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan [looks] into the future and uses what has been thought of and creates what hasn’t been thought of.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/","id":1922,"author":{"id":54,"name":"Nidhi Satyagal"},"related":[1921,1920,1919],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Our struggles as students are intertwined with the struggles of workers”: A.S.
