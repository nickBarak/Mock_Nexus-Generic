President Ali Guthy and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young. The event culminated in a surprise appearance and performance by UCSB alumni and rock musicians Jack Johnson and Animal Liberation Orchestra.</p>\n<p>As the first person to speak at the event, Guthy said “Come Together” was organized in order to honor the memories of six members of “our UCSB family,” — George Chen, Katherine Cooper, James Hong, Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, David Wang and Veronika Weiss — by remembering them while moving forward with efforts to improve the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“As a new academic year has begun and we being to focus on the hopes, goals and dreams that lie ahead, we remember them,” Guthy said. “As we take those moments out of our busy day to cherish what it means to be a Gaucho and part of an extraordinary, caring family, we remember them.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, who said he still has “difficulty wrapping [his] head around making sense out of the senseless acts of violence,” of May 23, “Come Together” was formed in order to encourage students to define and determine the character and quality of the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“You students individually and collectively have the ability to make Isla Vista and UCSB the kind of community that is not only extraordinarily beautiful and fun but also safe and healthy,” Young said. “I urge you to seize this moment and begin the important but hard difficult work of reclaiming and rebuilding our community. We got this.”</p>\n<p>After Young and Guthy spoke, Johnson and ALO musically collaborated, giving students a free performance for over an hour and a half. Throughout playing songs such as “Good People,” “Better Together” and “Banana Pancakes,” Johnson and ALO members commented on their time spent in Santa Barbara and reminisced on the fond memories they associate with their former life in I.V.</p>\n<p><em>A photo essay related to this article can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/in-photos-jack-johnson-at-the-memorial-event/\">here:</a></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/jack-johnson-performs-at-memorial-in-storke-plaza-come-together-remember-reconnect-unite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/jack-johnson-performs-at-memorial-in-storke-plaza-come-together-remember-reconnect-unite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/jack-johnson-performs-at-memorial-in-storke-plaza-come-together-remember-reconnect-unite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/jack-johnson-performs-at-memorial-in-storke-plaza-come-together-remember-reconnect-unite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/jack-johnson-performs-at-memorial-in-storke-plaza-come-together-remember-reconnect-unite/","id":3623,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[3622,3621,3620],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus.</p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate held their first meeting of the academic year this Wednesday in the Flying A room at the UCen.</p>\n<p>The meeting focused on discussions with University of California Police Department representatives, complaints of a lack of support for student organizations by the Rec Cen and an appeal for a new electoral process for Associated Students Senate elections.</p>\n<p>UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson informed the Senate that there would be increased police patrols on the weekends in Isla Vista and on campus.</p>\n<p>“A couple things that you might have noticed or heard about that we have underway are increased police patrols over the weekend, particularly on campus and in Isla Vista Thursday nights, Friday nights and Saturday nights,” Olson said. “We’re really trying to make sure the community feels safe and is safe.”</p>\n<p>Olson also said additional precautions would be taken during Halloween weekend, such as the presence of up to four times as many UCPD officers and drunk driving checkpoints.</p>\n<p>“We’re pulling a lot more UC officers into the operation than we’ve had in years past,” Olson said. “Say like, last year and years before that there was maybe like 25. This year we’re bringing in up to 100. These are UC officers from other UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>Olson answered questions from Senators regarding police policy towards people suspected of underage drinking.</p>\n<p>Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothschild asked if students were required to present identification to officers when on their own driveways and property. Olson responded by saying that students were not obligated to do so and would not be arrested if officers couldn’t prove that they were under age.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going tell you that you have to,” Olson said, “they’re not going to arrest you for being underage unless they know you’re underage.”</p>\n<p>Olson said UCPD was not looking to make students miserable or refrain from doing anything fun, but rather to simply behave in a responsible manner.</p>\n<p>“I’m not here to tell you that I don’t want you to have fun or do things that UCSB and college affords you to do, that’s just not right,” Olson said. “What we want you to do is be safe and make good decisions and be part of that success. I hope you know that and feel that when you see us out there … we’re not here to make your lives hard.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, members of the UCSB Cotillion Dance Club voiced complaints that the Rec Cen had taken action to make their club and its 100 members unable to practice.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major and Cotillion Dance Club member Letitia Mueller said actions taken by the Rec Cen to raise the price of renting rooms, thus making others unavailable altogether, has forced students to resort to practicing in unsafe locations such as parking lots.</p>\n<p>“This is dangerous. This is a liability,” Mueller said. “People are break-dancing in Lot 22. That’s so scary. People can break their necks, and it’s not okay. We need resource creation. We need a space to practice. There are no spaces for independent dance groups.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included a push to change Associated Student Senate’s election system, plans to improve mental health services at UCSB and successful voter registration drives on campus.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously incorrectly stated that the UCen Governance Board had implemented policies affecting the Cotillion Dance Club. That is incorrect. This department discussed in the Senate meeting was actually the Rec Cen.]</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, October 9, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily

In addition to being dubbed Nobel laureates, Nakamura, Akasaki and Amano will receive equal portions of $1.1 million in prize money. Nakamura and other Nobel recipients, not including the Nobel Peace Prize winner, will travel to Stockholm, Sweden, to receive their award on December 10. The rest of the Nobel Prize award winners will be announced later this week by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>The early morning celebration for Shuji Nakamura was short but sweet. Umesh Mishra, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, received a call at 2:45 a.m. from Steven DenBaars, who shares the title of co-director of the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/phosphor-analysis-could-improve-led-efficiency/\">Solid State Lighting &amp; Energy Center</a> with Nakamura at UCSB.

Unusually high demand for housing has made it nearly impossible for students to find housing in Isla Vista, Goleta and even downtown Santa Barbara. Some students have resorted to staying in costly motels while they await assistance from the Community Housing Office (CHO), the university administration responsible for helping students find living accommodations.</p>\n<p>According to Community Housing Office Manager Roane Akchurin, in her 25 years of working with the CHO she could only recall one other year with a similar housing shortage situation, which was in 1989. According to Akchurin, approximately 100 students are still without housing, a shortage that did not become apparent to the CHO until a month ago.</p>\n<p>“It seemed like a normal year,” Akchurin said, “I’ve been here 25 years, up until August, then right when September hit we started getting phone calls from international students saying housing was tighter than usual.”</p>\n<p>Akchurin said the housing crunch has been the result of a multitude of factors outside of the University’s control.</p>\n<p>“It’s a way bigger issue than just UCSB,” Akchurin said. “There’s City College and Westmont students that impact the market place, as well as an influx of construction contractors working in Goleta that have added to the housing shortage.”</p>\n<p>According to Akchurin, her office has reached out to the broader community to provide housing for many afflicted students.</p>\n<p>“We sent a letter to local folks to ask people to come forward and provide housing, and the response has been amazing,” Aktchurin said. “The community has been great.”</p>\n<p>However, students like fourth-year international business major Daniel Luckyman remain homeless. A transfer student from Germany through EAP, Luckyman said he and another student from Germany have been looking relentlessly for housing for a month now.</p>\n<p>“We came here a month before to find housing,” Luckyman said, “We were here every day checking Craigslist and going house to house.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56415\" style=\"width: 206px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1967489030\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56367\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56415\" data-attachment-id=\"56415\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/eap-students-without-housing/eap-housing-mishap/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg?fit=1414%2C1802&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1414,1802\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"MG5300 series\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"EAP Housing Mishap\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg?fit=196%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg?fit=804%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56415 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap-196x250.jpg?resize=196%2C250\" alt=\"Upon arriving to Santa Barbara, many EAP students expecting to find university housing found themselves without homes.

The state assemblyman co-authored a bill allowing courts to issue gun violence restraining orders. According to Williams, the bill was written to address “a gap in the law.” Kenneth Song/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Two laws introduced by state legislators from the Santa Barbara area following last spring’s murder spree in Isla Vista, which took the lives of six UCSB students, were approved by Governor Jerry Brown this past Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The approved laws are AB 1014, which allows a judge to issue a temporary, emergency restraining order to briefly prohibit an individual’s access to firearms if they are judged to be dangerous, and SB 505, which requires local law enforcement agencies to implement written policies to encourage officers to consult the Department of Justice Automated Firearms System to determine whether a person subject to a welfare check is the registered owner of a firearm. The authors of the newly approved laws and other public officials gathered at Anisq’oyo’ Park in I.V. yesterday for a press conference on the law’s approval.</p>\n<p>State assemblyman for Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and AB 1014 co-author Das Williams stated that the governor’s approval of the gun violence restraining order is a “huge victory” that empowers law enforcement and family members to take steps to protect themselves.</p>\n<p>Williams also said in a separate press conference that he was inspired to author the bill to address a “gap in the law” that became evident following the events of May 23.</p>\n<p>“As I learned more about the details of this incident and that the family of the perpetrator of this violence had made an effort to alert law enforcement to possible danger, it became clear the system wasn’t set up, directly, to protect us as a community,” Williams said at the press conference yesterday. “In the future, it will be a tool for concerned family members, friends and law enforcement to deal with troubled individuals.”</p>\n<p>AB 1014, which goes into full effect Jan. 1, 2016, authorizes a given court to issue a maximum 21-day “gun violence restraining order” prohibiting the subject of the order from owning or having any access to firearms or ammunition. The issuance of such an order is contingent upon the court’s determination that the subject of the order poses a threat to themselves or others by having access to firearms.</p>\n<p>The law states that gun violence restraining orders can be requested by both an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer. The bill also requires an additional court hearing to be held within the 21-day period to determine whether a year-long order prohibiting firearm access should be issued. Additional year-long orders can also be issued at the court’s discretion.</p>\n<p>Williams also said in a separate interview that roommates would be able to make a request for the order because under California law anyone living with someone for a minimum of six months also qualifies as immediate family.</p>\n<p>The issuance of a gun violence restraining order would also require that the subject of the order surrender all firearms in their possession. Under current laws, sheriff’s deputies can ask the subject of a welfare check to voluntarily surrender firearms, but cannot seize weapons simply during welfare calls, according to Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office can only hold firearms if it determined there is a danger to the individual or the public.  A check the welfare call does not alone permit the Sheriff’s Office to seize weapons,” Hoover said in a prior interview.  “Depending on the circumstances, the Sheriff’s Office could hold weapons seized for a period of time up till approximately 180 days, but typically 60-to-90 days.”</p>\n<p>Williams also said he thought the “most important thing” when it comes to addressing existing gun laws is to get Congress to act.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to pass some very good gun laws here,” Williams said in a separate interview. “But at a national level nothing has been done. Sandy Hook, Colorado, our tragedy in Isla Vista, all of this has happened, and while it’s changed the politics of Sacramento it hasn’t changed the politics in Washington at all … so people are gonna have to get angry and demand that change.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Jennifer Suh and friend of Christopher Michaels-Martinez was present at yesterday’s press conference and said she believed the bill’s approval is a start to making a difference.</p>\n<p>“Even if it doesn’t make a huge dent in the problem, even if it doesn’t make a huge difference in the bigger issue, I think it’s a start,” Suh said.</p>\n<p>In late August, the families of slain UCSB students Christopher Michaels-Martinez, Veronika Weiss and Katie Cooper wrote a letter to Brown urging him to approve the legislation and emphasized that if a gun violence restraining order had been possible prior to the shooting, lives could have been saved.</p>\n<p>“Nothing we can do will bring back Christopher, but I’m confident this new law will help save lives and prevent other families from experiencing this same kind of tragedy. States around the country should be exploring this life-saving measure,” Richard Martinez said in a statement following the law’s approval.</p>\n<p>SB 505 author and State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, said the governor’s approval of SB 505 would better equip law enforcement during welfare calls.</p>\n<p>“This bill will help ensure that law enforcement agencies are using all the tools available to them to gather potentially life-saving information for themselves and others,” Jackson said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Three weeks prior to the Isla Vista shooting, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s deputies contacted assailant Elliot Rodger as a part of a welfare check at his parent’s request, but did not know he possessed any firearms and cleared the call. Under the new law, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office will now be required to develop policies to encourage officers to consult the Department of Justice’s Automated Firearms Database prior to conducting a welfare check.</p>\n<p>Welfare calls are fairly commonplace, but consulting the Automated Firearms System prior to taking a call is not standard procedure and would only occur if deputies felt the individual in question posed a threat to themselves or others, Hoover said in a prior interview.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56357\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56357\" data-attachment-id=\"56357\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/brown-approves-precautionary-gun-laws/legislation-doreen-farr-weiss-and-martinez_10-01-2014_kenneth-song-copy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy.jpg?fit=2760%2C1892&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2760,1892\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412172768\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Legislation Doreen Farr, Weiss, and Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth Song – Copy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy.jpg?fit=250%2C171&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy.jpg?fit=888%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-56357\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy-1024x701.jpg?resize=888%2C608\" alt=\"Kenneth Song//Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"608\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-56357\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Song/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>This story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, October 2, 2014’s print edition of the <i>Daily Nexus.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In addition to being the first Executive Dean, Marshall has served on various campus organizations such as the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on Budget Strategy and the Chancellor’s Advisory Council on Campus Climate. He has also helped found UCSB’s COLLABORATE, an organization that promotes effective use of technologies as a support for instruction.</p>\n<p>Marshall said his previous experience as the Dean of Humanities and UCSB’s interdisciplinary and collaborative culture have allowed him to become involved in many partnerships with other schools and academic divisions as well as deal with issues such as budget, space planning and enrollment. As an active member of UC committees and programs, Marshall said he plans to work with students, alumni and administration on education while also focusing more specifically on issues in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to working with the UCSB community to develop an academic plan that will allow us to fulfill our mission as a leading research university dedicated to education and public service.” Marshall said in an email. “In addition, I will be working closely with the Chancellor as we take important steps to address the problems associated with Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Dean of the College of Letters and Science Melvin Oliver, who has worked closely with Marshall, said the College of Letters and Science will continue collaboration with Marshall on various initiatives and challenges that affect the CLS.</p>\n<p>“Some of the main areas we’ll address in the coming year are the quality and diversity of our faculty; adapting to the changing instructional environment that includes online and hybrid classes; and ensuring that we are able to offer enough courses for students to have timely completion of their degree objectives,” Oliver said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he created the EVC Search Advisory Committee with consultation from various other committees such as Academic Senate Committee on Committees, Associated Students and Graduate Students Association for membership.

Daily Nexus File Photo.</p></div>\n<p>He has advised the Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, NASA and the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>This past year, he finished his term as an elected chairman of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, which includes 45 of the top research universities across four continents surrounding and within the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>Since 2007, he has been the chairman of the Thirty Meter Telescope project, a partnership between the University of California, Caltech and institutions across the globe working to build a telescope 30 meters in diameter in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. He has also guided nine UCSB Ph.D. candidates with research grants from the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>Since 2008, he has served on the President’s Committee for the National Medal of Science, a U.S. presidential appointment that recommends winners from a pool of nominees to the President of the United States. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Society for Engineering Education and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.</p>\n<p>And for the last 20 years, he has served as chancellor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Henry T. Yang was invited to become UCSB’s fifth chancellor in 1994 after leaving his position as dean of the Schools of Engineering at Purdue University.</p>\n<p>“I was honored and pleased to be invited to UC Santa Barbara as … chancellor,” Yang said in an email. “To build a pre-eminent world-class research university with excellence and diversity and with the fulfillment of its responsibilities of teaching, research, and service is a mission that will never end.”</p>\n<p>Yang received his bachelor’s degree from National Taiwan University and his Ph.D. from Cornell. According to the Office of the Chancellor, he specializes in aerospace structures, structural dynamics, composite materials, finite elements, transonic aeroelasticity, wind and earthquake structural engineering and intelligent manufacturing systems.</p>\n<p>Yang said he took the job with aspirations of continuing and strengthening the university’s tradition of academic excellence and called the job “exciting and rewarding.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the number of freshman applications has quadrupled from 17,000 in 1994 to 66,800 this year, while the GPA of the entering class has risen from 3.47 to 3.98 in that same period. Earlier this month, U.S. News and World Report ranked UCSB as one of the nation’s top ten public universities.</p>\n<p>Former Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud said Yang has played a vital role in intensifying the university’s prestige.</p>\n<p>“Because of him we went from being a backwater UC in 1994 to being one of the top research universities in the world,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, one of the reasons he has remained with UCSB include the university’s election to the Association of American Universities, with five UCSB faculty members and one alumnus winning Nobel Prizes. With characteristic humility, he credits everyone who attends, works at or otherwise contributes to UCSB as grounds for its success.</p>\n<p>“With the vision and hard work of our faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, and supporters, I have had the tremendous honor and joy of witnessing the exciting growth of UC Santa Barbara,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Abboud, who worked closely with Yang during his time as A.S. president, said although he and the chancellor did not “agree 100 percent on everything,” both shared a mutual respect, especially after dealing with the tumultuous events of last Spring.</p>\n<p>“Well I don’t have experience with any other chancellor, but I do know that he has students at the top of his list of priorities,” Abboud said. “If people had a sit-in in his office, instead of run away like other administrators at other campuses do, he would talk to students and try to solve the issue.”</p>\n<p>Aside from his administrative responsibilities, Yang also teaches a structural engineering once a year to 50 undergraduates in the College of Engineering. Though Yang holds many accolades under his belt, he said his distinguished teaching award from the UCSB Academic Senate is the award he holds most dear.</p>\n<p>“I see him involved a lot,” third-year biology and communication double major Caitlin Weis said. “It seems like he’s more involved with the community than most chancellors.”</p>\n<p>Chair of the Mechanical Engineering Department Francesco Bullo said Yang “has a ton of experience, infinite wisdom and positive energy” and for this reason is happy to have him in the department.<br>\n“I believe our students love working with him and learning from him,” Bullo said in an email. “He’s always ready with a word of advice and encouragement, and he’s so organized and knowledgeable.”<br>\nIndeed, Yang said he is happy to be chancellor.</p>\n<p>“I am so honored and pleased to serve UC Santa Barbara, and to witness it growing steadily and exponentially in excellence, diversity, and world-class stature,” he said. “I look forward to many years of working with our faculty, students, staff, and alumni, and to continuing our exciting journey together.”</p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <i>Daily Nexus.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56226\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56226\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/","id":3475,"author":{"id":191,"name":"Hannah Nelson"},"related":[3474,3473,3472],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Michael Young To Retire in 2015 After 25 Years","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Michael Young, UCSB’s Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs for 25 years, will be retiring from his position in January 2015.

Yang announced Young’s planned departure in a recently released memo on the Office of the Chancellor website. Young oversees the Division of Student Affairs, a large administrative arm of the university that oversees various non-academic campus departments including Judicial Affairs, Student Health and the Office of Student Life, among others.</p>\n<p>In his memo to the campus, Yang expressed his “sincere appreciation” for Young’s time with the university and described Young’s relationship with university staff and students as that of an “advocate and mentor.”</p>\n<p>“He has worked closely with our students and with colleagues across the campus and UC system to foster a supportive and inclusive community,” Yang said in the memo. “Many of our alumni have returned over the years to express their gratitude for his mentorship and support.”<br>\nYoung joined the campus as the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs in 1990, previously serving as the Associate Dean of the College and University Registrar at Wesleyan University.</p>\n<p>According to Associate Dean of Students Don Lubach, who was in Student Affairs when Young was hired to run the division, UCSB has greatly benefitted from Young’s “principled and consistent” leadership qualities. According to Lubach, when Young arrived at UCSB the state was on a downward economic cycle, yet he immediately consulted with the dozens of departments to figure out how to keep service levels high while saving money.</p>\n<p>“He vowed to save as many of our jobs as possible,” Lubach said. “His creativity worked. I don’t think our Division had a single layoff because of his leadership.”</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead, who has worked with Young for almost 24 years, said he is “relentless” about pushing staff to continue their education and pushed Armistead to complete her doctorate degree, along with many other professionals.</p>\n<p>“Michael is a man of principle,” Armistead said, “he’s consistent, and he has a way truly listening to students and staff.”Director of Student Health Services Mary Ferris said Young’s legacy includes support for diversity, tolerance and training and professional development.</p>\n<p>“He has been such an inspiring leader for us all,” Ferris said in an email. “Many current campus staff leaders have been mentored and guided by him, so even though we will sorely miss him, he is leaving a whole new generation of Student Affairs leaders that can continue his vision.”</p>\n<p>According to Lubach, along with being well known across UC campuses as the “Mental Health Administrator,” Young has led a number of UC-wide efforts to support students who are challenged with depression, anxiety and other issues and has led an overhaul of nearly “every computer system that affects students.”</p>\n<p>“Clearly, Michael Young has left the campus in much better condition than it was in the [1990s] when he arrived,” Lubach said. “He has modernized our systems, but kept us working well with old-fashioned care and solid leadership.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said Young has taught her, the rest of her division and the university a great deal of wisdom.</p>\n<p>“Michael’s legacy includes a strong believe in professional development, freedom of speech, even though I also learned from him that just because you can say something, doesn’t mean you should, and to show up well,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, a nationwide search committee will be formed to find candidates to replace Young, whose last day will be Jan. 31, 2015.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Photo by Kenneth Song//<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Regents of the University of California held their last meeting of the summer at the UCSF Mission Bay Community Center last Wednesday and Thursday, where they appointed a new UC Irvine chancellor, discussed future plans regarding UC finances and received recommendations for the sexual assault task force recently created by UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p>During public comment, speakers addressed the Regents about issues such as the UC’s investments in fossil fuel companies as well as University efforts to respond to sexual assault on campuses.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Napolitano discussed the UC investment portfolio and gave updates on the UC-Mexico Initiative and the UC Global Food Initiative. The University Committee on Educational Policy presented initial recommendations from the sexual assault task force and then discussed partnerships at UC Davis to advance food and health research.</p>\n<p>Educational Policy Committee Chair Regent Bonnie Reiss said the task force would continue its work into the next year and quickly draft a plan to implement its recommendations by July 2015.</p>\n<p>“As Regents we take very seriously our role as stewards of UC. We care about maintaining our role as the premier research institution on the planet,” Reiss said. “As important as this mission is, providing a safe environment is every bit as important, perhaps more important.”</p>\n<p>Members of the sexual assault task force included UC Senior Vice President Sheryl Vacca and fourth-year international development studies major UCLA Savannah Badalich, both of whom discussed task force goals before presenting seven overarching recommendations to the board.</p>\n<p>The recommendations included the creation of consistent a “response team model” at all campuses with separate focuses on reporting and prevention education; system-wide standard investigation and adjudication standards; a system-wide training and education plan for students, staff and faculty; community education about UC programs; creation of an independent confidential advocacy office for sexual violence on each campus; a system-wide website customized for each campus to provide students with resources regarding sexual assault; and a “standardized data set” leveraging existing sexual violence data, to report data in a consistent manner, with agreed upon definitions.</p>\n<p>Badalich said student respondents played a large role in generating some of the recommendations, especially the recommendation to establish an independent confidential advocacy office and the system-wide, campus-customized website.</p>\n<p>“Many students on campuses don’t know who to go to, who they can talk to about their assault without having to give a mandatory report,” Badalich said, speaking from personal experience. “After my assault I Googled ‘sexual assault at UCLA’ and the many different websites confused me, so one website would be very effective.”</p>\n<p>Badalich also emphasized how sexual assault prevention education and alcohol abuse education should not be “conflated” in new student orientation presentations and said that all faculty and staff should be required to participate in “survivor centered” sensitivity training.</p>\n<p>According to Reiss, the system-wide standardization of penalties and minimum responses following a guilty verdict in the university adjudication of a sexual assault case will be further assessed in Phase II of the task force’s work. Badalich also said the task force would keep itself open to additional recommendations in the work it does in Phase II.</p>\n<p>The Regents then convened the Committee on Finance and discussed the UC’s energy service programs to achieve climate neutrality in a presentation given by newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom and UCOP Vice President of Budget and Capital Resources Patrick J. Lenz.</p>\n<p>According to Brostrom, widespread efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are taking place across campuses, with each university cutting its emissions down to the same levels they were in 2000, as per University climate policy. Brostrom also said the UC is examining ways to reduce greenhouse gas output by eventually transitioning from burning natural gas to burning biomethane, with proposals on such efforts to come as early as the November Regent’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Brostrom and Lenz also overviewed the budget for the current fiscal year before discussing preliminary budget priority recommendations for the 2015-16 fiscal year. Among the preliminary recommendations for the priorities of the next fiscal year were a minimum of $120 to $130 million in mandatory costs, a minimum $195 million in high-priority costs and $50 million in “quality reinvestment” costs to increase graduate student support, reduce the student-faculty ratio and reduce faculty and staff salary gaps, among other purposes.</p>\n<p>According to a memo from UCOP to the Committee on Finance, the $120 million in mandatory costs are unavoidable costs that must be covered before other high-priority costs or initiatives can be funded. Lenz said if Governor Jerry Brown maintains his four percent increase in the UC’s general fund as part of his multi-year education funding plan — an amount of about $119 million — that revenue could “just fall short” of covering the proposed mandatory costs.</p>\n<p>Following the presentation, Regent Richard Blum said he is dissatisfied with what he described as the state’s “continuous” underfunding of the UC system.</p>\n<p>“We are now educating 78,000 more students with the same amount of money … than we did 25 years ago,” Blum said. “How do we do it? Larger class sizes, not a good thing. Greater tuitions, let buildings run down … there’s hardly a month goes by that I don’t hear about some dean or some chancellor worried about losing yet another good person because of a much better offer.”</p>\n<p>According to Blum, “corruption” in Sacramento is due to the UC’s current funding issues.</p>\n<p>“We at the University get the short stick,” Blum said. “We’re gonna turn this place into a community college if we keep going the way we are … after watching all this for all these years, I’m tired of it.”</p>\n<p>According to the slides of the Lenz presentation, between fiscal years 1990-91 and 2014-15, state funding for the UC grew 31 percent while inflation grew 80 percent. The UC also enrolled over 82,000 more students.</p>\n<p>The Regents then approved a $297 million dollar package to fund 15 capital improvement projects, mostly related to infrastructure and “seismic/life safety needs” as part of the 2015-16 budget for state capital improvements. One proposed project included $15 million in seismic work on UCSB’s Campbell Hall, subject to further review at the November Regents meeting.</p>\n<p>Prior to convening the Committee on Investments, the Regents heard from Jefferson Kuoch-Seng, a fourth-year management major at UC Merced and newly elected UCSA President who discussed the continuation of the IGNITE campaign, aiming to “dismantle the school to prison pipeline” as well as the recently announced UConsent campaign against sexual assault and sexual violence. Kuoch-Seng also spoke against tuition increases despite what he described as the UC’s “budget shortfall”.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Investments then heard a discussion item from UCOP Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Bachher on the status of the UC’s investment portfolio in the last fiscal year. According to slides presented during Bachher’s presentation, the UC’s total assets under management grew almost 15 percent in the last fiscal year, increasing $78.4 billion to some $90 billion, described as an “all-time high.” The UC’s investments, according to Bachher, are approximately 70 percent in North America, with 10 billion dollars in Asia, and five percent in “emerging markets,” with roughly half the total assets invested in the stock market and 20 percent and 30 percent in alternative assets and fixed income sources, respectively.</p>\n<p>After lengthy discussion, the Regents also approved the establishment of UC Ventures, an independent fund to pursue investments in companies that use UC research, subject to approval of the Regents with an initial amount of $250 million to get started.</p>\n<p>“Its pretty clear that there are opportunities, they have been profitable for investors and they exist within our organization,” Bachher said. “It is a new way to finance and benefit from innovation within the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Regent Blum said he thought it would be difficult to attract investors away from private companies in the Bay Area and cautioned Bachher on the proposal.</p>\n<p>“Other universities have done it but … you are entering into a long hard struggle and I would be very surprised if you come back three or four years from now and you will have made any money at all,” Blum said.</p>\n<p>The President’s Task Force on Sustainable Investing also presented recommendations to the Regents on implementing sustainable investment practices. Bachher specifically addressed the demands of the student-led Fossil Free UC Campaign.</p>\n<p>Task force member Bachher said he recognized efforts made by Fossil Free UC toward fossil fuel divestment and said that of the UC’s $90 billion dollar investment portfolio, roughly 10 percent of it is anchored in energy investments. According to Bachher, divesting from companies in the top 200 of emitters would result in a divestment of $3 billion, while cutting coal investments alone would equate to a $500 million dollar divestment.</p>\n<p>The Regents also passed a motion recommending the establishment and implementation of a framework on sustainable investment to be completed by June 2015 that integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as a core component of “portfolio optimization.” The board allocated $1 billion over five years to investment pursuits in renewable power and fuels as well as in energy efficiency, among other possibilities.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Compliance then presented to the board several discussion items on the internal auditing activities conducted at all UC locations between July and August, as well as a presentation by UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks on recent NCAA rule changes and their impact on the PAC-12 conference, of which UCLA and UC Berkeley are members.</p>\n<p>During the Thursday morning session the Regents appointed Howard Gillman as UC Irvine’s sixth chancellor following the departure of former Chancellor Michael V. Drake, who has been serving as Ohio State University’s president since June.</p>\n<p>Gillman previously served as the provost and executive vice chancellor, and was interim chancellor for the Irvine campus since January. According to Napolitano, Gilman was selected after a four month national search from a pool of some 405 prospective candidates. The board also approved a $485,000 compensation package for Gillman.</p>\n<p>Chair of the Board of Regents Bruce Varner praised Gilman’s leadership ability and dedication during the appointment.</p>\n<p>“Strong leadership is central to the excellence of each of our 10 campuses,” Varner said in a UCOP statement. “Chancellor Gillman has demonstrated he has the leadership attributes, the vision and the dedication to public service needed to move UC Irvine forward with vigor and integrity.”</p>\n<p>Gillman gave a brief address following his confirmation by the Regents. Following Gillman’s remarks, the Regents reconvened the Committee on Compensation and passed an action item to develop a policy to keep the compensation of UC chancellors competitive compared to “peer institutions.”</p>\n<p>The Regents also passed a motion to raise the pay of four UC chancellors who are among the lowest paid chancellors in the UC system, including UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The motion’s approval of increased Yang’s pay by roughly 20 percent, from $324,450 to $389,340.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal and UC Merced Chancellor Dorothy Leland also had their compensation packages raised 20 percent with the passage of the motion. A five percent increase was also given to UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox in the same motion.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Health Services was then convened and heard a discussion on the current financial status of the UCSF Medical Center and its soon-to-open Mission Bay Hospital, as well as a discussion on the needs of each campus to address student mental health. Regent William De La Pena requested further investigation of mental health needs of students across UC campuses and asked for a more detailed report to be presented at the Regent’s November meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

id=\"caption-attachment-56093\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students at UCSB allege the university violated the Clery Act and federal statute Title IX for not properly handling sexual assault case. <em>(Photo courtesy of bfs.ucsb.edu)</em></p></div>\n<p>Six current and former UCSB students filed federal complaints against the university last Wednesday, citing violations of the Clery Act and Title IX in the way university administration handled their sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>The complaints allege that administration discouraged the reporting of sexual assault, did not appropriately sanction students admitting to sexually assaulting fellow students and created a hostile environment by allowing alleged assailants to remain in classes with their victims, among other violations. The complaints could result in a federal investigation of the university and steep financial penalties if Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and Federal Student Aid (FSA) officials deem such action appropriate.</p>\n<p>Colleges and universities are required to disclose information about crimes occurring on and around their campuses via the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, and Title IX is a federal statute that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity that receives federal funding. Both laws are enforced by the Department of Education.</p>\n<p>The complaints were filed with the help of End Rape on Campus (EROC), a sexual assault survivor advocacy group of current and former college students, which assisted the UCSB students in drawing together their complaints based on both Title IX and the Clery Act.</p>\n<p>According to EROC staff member Annie Clark, the Department of Education receives separate complaints pertaining to Title IX and the Clery Act. Clark also said that if the OCR finds a school in violation of Title IX they face what she described as an “all or nothing” penalty.</p>\n<p>“There’s a nuclear option of revoking all federal funding or nothing, which basically means they sit down with the school and the school promises to do better,” Clark said. “There’s no real accountability there.”</p>\n<p>For Clery Act violations, Clark said the Department of Education may levy a fine of up to $35,000 per violation.</p>\n<p><strong>Taking on the Crimmel Case</strong></p>\n<p>Lead complainant and recent UCSB graduate Myra Crimmel said her assault occurred on Sept. 8 of last year and that when she reported it to her crisis counselor at UCSB’s Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE), as well as to Judicial Affairs, naming her assailant, she was initially told the evidence presented was so severe the university had an obligation to pursue her case.</p>\n<p>According to CARE Director Jill Dunlap, CARE counselors assist those on campus impacted by sexual violence by supporting their decision whether or not to report the incident through official channels, as well as by accompanying the formation of a report and serving as a support person through subsequent processes.</p>\n<p>“CARE advocates are available to support a survivor through any reporting process,” Dunlap said in an email, “including campus judicial processes, as well as criminal law enforcement proceedings.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56091\" style=\"width: 199px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"757508921\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56090\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56091\" data-attachment-id=\"56091\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?fit=498%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"498,500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?fit=498%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56091\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=189%2C190\" alt=\"44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd\" width=\"189\" height=\"190\" align=\"left\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?w=498&amp;ssl=1 498w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Campus Advocacy Resources &amp;

After the attorneys got involved however, various meetings between her alleged assailant and Judicial Affairs were canceled, allowing the accused to “stonewall” the case by delaying a decision, Crimmel said.</p>\n<p>“I expressed my need for the case to end in a timely manner, which the Code of Student Conduct promised me,” Crimmel stated in her complaint. “Instead, I was told ‘these things take time’ and that there was nothing I could do in the meantime. I was told that ‘the system is the way it is, you need to let it play out.’”</p>\n<p>At this time Crimmel said Judicial Affairs assured her in December her alleged perpetrator would be kept from enrolling in future classes with her. Yet when she began class Winter quarter, long after the promised 60 day limit for case resolution, Crimmel found her alleged assailant attending one of her classes. Mid-way through last Winter quarter, Crimmel’s alleged assailant requested a hearing with Crimmel while she said she distressed over moving forward and risking her case getting dropped completely in the event she lost.</p>\n<p>Crimmel also said a representative from Judicial Affairs and her crisis counselor at this point began discouraging her from going through with the hearing.</p>\n<p>“[The Judicial Affairs officer] also told me … ‘I don’t want you to go through it’ and ‘It is so much work on our end.’ I felt helpless because my crisis counselor was my only ally and was unfamiliar with the adjudication process,” Crimmel stated in her complaint. “[The crisis counselor] told me that during her time of employment there, she has never seen a sexual assault case result in a hearing.”</p>\n<p>Crimmel opted not to go through with the hearing.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, she said Judicial Affairs had contacted her father and informed him that Crimmel’s alleged assailant had refused to admit guilt and that neither the incident nor the sanctions would appear on the student’s transcript or criminal record.</p>\n<p>According to correspondence between Crimmel and Judicial Affairs provided by Crimmel, her case was closed March 4, 2014 and her alleged assailant was permitted to take his Winter quarter finals before withdrawing from the university until Fall 2014, after Crimmel’s graduation, where he was allowed to attend on disciplinary probation.</p>\n<p>“By refusing to accept responsibility and using his attorneys, he guaranteed that there would be no trace of what happened or why he temporarily left UCSB,” Crimmel stated in her complaint. “How will students be safe when a perpetrator can return to the campus after facing virtually no consequences other than some lost time and a quarter-long suspension?”</p>\n<p><strong>The Aftermath: Filing the Complaint</strong></p>\n<p>Director of Judicial Affairs Stephan Franklin said he could not offer comment on the complaint and that punishments for perpetrators of such cases vary considerably depending on individual circumstances.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Office of Public Affairs also released a statement that said the university takes “students’ reports of sexual assault extremely seriously” and that they offer counseling, support and advocacy resources, as well as a “comprehensive adjudication process” to those impacted by sexual assault.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_55124\" style=\"width: 352px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"524382703\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56090\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55124\" data-attachment-id=\"55124\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/doe-official-discusses-sexual-assault/lhamon-media2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?fit=1538%2C849&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1538,849\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"SLT-A57\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1398856647\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Catherine Lhamon held a media availability after her meeting with student leaders on sexual assault.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?fit=888%2C490&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-55124\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21-1024x565.jpg?resize=342%2C195\" alt=\"Catherine Lhamon held a media availability after her meeting with student leaders on sexual assault.\" width=\"342\" height=\"195\" align=\"left\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=342%2C195 684w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=342%2C195 1026w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education Catherine Lhamon met with student leaders on sexual assault this past Spring.</p></div>\n<p>According to Dunlap, CARE interacts with students based on the “empowerment model,” designed to give students more control over their options after an assault. She also said CARE program staff are currently collaborating with the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment/Title IX Compliance to develop a faculty guide for “responding to disclosures from survivors of interpersonal violence.”</p>\n<p>“It’s important that the student be in charge of their own recovery process,” Dunlap said in an email, “and CARE staff are here to support whatever decisions they make.”</p>\n<p>According to a spokesperson with the Department of Education who wished to remain anonymous, the Office for Civil Rights does not confirm the receipt of complaints and “will inform the institution, the complainant and the public as appropriate.” A staffer with the Department of Education’s San Francisco Office, who also wished to remain anonymous, said the evaluation of Title IX complaints from the time the complaint is received to the notification of complaint investigation or dismissal usually takes 30 calendar days.</p>\n<p>Kelty Kauffman, co-chair of campus sexual assault survivor advocacy group Take Back the Night, said the university must make strides to better combat sexual violence and provide sexual assault response resources that are swift, effective and accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“You can do a Judicial Affairs complaint, but right now there’s no one on campus besides Take Back the Night and CARE who tells students that that is an available option,” third-year English and Feminist Studies double major Kauffman said. “Most students have no idea that that they can even do that, and if they do know that they can do that, they don’t know where to go. They don’t know who to talk to. They don’t know anything.”</p>\n<p>According to Crimmel, the driving force motivating her to file the federal complaint is the hope that it will “ bring justice to those silenced by trauma.”</p>\n<p>“I was victimized twice, both by my perpetrator and my university, but the silver lining is that I am now more strong and resilient,” Crimmel said in her complaint. “Going forward, prompt action must be taken against perpetrators of sexual assaults, and survivors must be treated with respect. What happens in Isla Vista does not stay here. Things must change.”</p>\n<p><em>Editor-in-chief Carissa Quiambao contributed to this report.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56090\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56090\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/","id":3426,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3425,3424,3423],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Passes Bill to Prevent Gun Violence, Sent to Brown","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The California State Senate unanimously passed Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s bill to prevent gun violence last Friday, and the bill now heads to Governor Jerry Brown, who must approve the bill by Se...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_55991\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55991\" data-attachment-id=\"55991\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/jackson_ben/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben.jpg?fit=1447%2C932&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1447,932\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Database\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T1i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1400962866\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Jackson_Ben\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben.jpg?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben.jpg?fit=888%2C572&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-55991 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben-1024x659.jpg?resize=888%2C571\" alt=\"Following the tragic shooting that took place in I.V. on May 23, the bill was introduced.

The purpose of the bill is to assure that law enforcement has adequate information when responding to welfare calls.</p></div>\n<p>The California State Senate unanimously passed Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s bill to prevent gun violence last Friday, and the bill now heads to Governor Jerry Brown, who must approve the bill by Sept. 30 for it to become law.</p>\n<p>The bill was introduced following the events of the May 23 Isla Vista mass shootings which killed six people, three of gunshot wounds, by SBCC student Elliot Rodger. Three weeks prior to the shooting, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s deputies contacted Rodger as part of a welfare check at his parent’s request but did not know he possessed any firearms and cleared the call. SB 505 requires law enforcement agencies across the state to develop and implement policies encouraging officers to consult the Department of Justice’s Automated Firearms System prior to conducting a welfare check.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, the purpose of the bill is to ensure that law enforcement has adequate information at their disposal when responding to welfare calls.</p>\n<p>“This bill would help ensure that law enforcement agencies are using all the tools available to them to gather potentially life-saving information for themselves and others,” Jackson said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to Senator Jackson’s communications director Lisa Gardiner, while welfare checks can be conducted by law enforcement for various reasons, SB 505 only applies to calls where “there is a concern the person may be in danger to themselves or others.”</p>\n<p>Welfare calls are fairly commonplace, but consulting the Automated Firearms System prior to taking a call is not standard procedure and would only occur if deputies felt the individual in question posed a threat to themselves or others, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover said. According to Hoover, deputies responding to the April 30 call for Rodger did not feel the need to consult the register based on their interaction with him at the time, and were thus unaware he possessed any firearms.</p>\n<p>Hoover also said deputies are empowered to ask individuals possessing weapons to voluntarily forfeit them during a welfare check but that responding to such calls alone does not permit the sheriff’s office to simply seize weapons.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office can only hold firearms if it determined there is a danger to the individual or the public.  A check the welfare call does not alone permit the Sheriff’s Office to seize weapons,” Hoover said. “Depending on the circumstances, the Sheriff’s Office could hold weapons seized for a period of time up till approximately 180 days, but typically 60 to 90 days.”</p>\n<p>The Automated Firearms System will prove to be beneficial by virtue of making knowledge more accessible to law enforcement, which Amanda Wilcox of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in California said will put law enforcement “in a better position to protect their own safety” because “the more knowledge they have about what guns to expect the more they’re in a better position to protect their own safety.”</p>\n<p>“It’s an officer safety issue,” Wilcox said. “A lot of resources have gone into having the kind of database we have in California and we, including law enforcement, should be taking full advantage of that information.”</p>\n<p>The bill has received the support of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the California Police Chief’s Association. The latter group, according to Gardiner, lobbied for the bill to enable local law enforcement agencies to design policies on how law enforcement officers would consult the Automated Firearms Systems database.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Wednesday, August 27, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/","id":3473,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3472,3471,3470],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Spanning two hours, suggestions regarding creating a neighborhood association or a community services district centered Monday’s discussion.</p>\n<p>Since the 1960s, Isla Vista has had difficulty becoming a self-governing entity, failing to pass cityhood attempts three different times in 1973, 1975 and 1984.</p>\n<p>According to Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr, the main issue Isla Vista has with becoming a self-governing entity is finding sustainable funding.</p>\n<p>“We need as much help as we can get from all segments of the community,” Farr said. “It’s really important. I think that we are making strides on infrastructure, but the key baseline issue is sustainable funding.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Isla Vista’s small geographic size and large population density is a challenge towards procuring sustainable funding, Farr said.</p>\n<p>“Traditionally, money comes from property tax, sales tax, [and] bed tax,” Farr said. “Isla Vista doesn’t really have any hotels, so it has no bed tax. It has some sales tax, but not a lot. It’s mainly property tax, but they need to balance that off with the amount of services they need, which is a lot.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista is one of Santa Barbara County’s four pockets of poverty, according to Farr. Because many students and low-income families already struggle to makes ends meet, Farr said it would be unfair to charge them more money.</p>\n<p>Town hall attendee and Isla Vista resident Jeffrey Walsh said that members of all ends of the Isla Vista community need to speak with each other to develop a plan for the future.</p>\n<p>“There’s lots of different, diverse members of the population,” Walsh said. “We felt that it was really important that those groups or stakeholders caucused among themselves because they’re not monolithic groups that are all in agreement with each other.”</p>\n<p>While meetings continue to be planned, former A.S. president Jonathan Abboud said choosing a self-governance option too soon could ultimately hurt the community more than help it.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a smart idea to rush into any one option because it could end up being not what we actually need,” Abboud said, “or it could end up being a little useless, or not as effective as we need it to be.”</p>\n<p>As far as a future community center goes, Farr said the former Redevelopment Agency properties on Embarcadero Del Mar could serve as a potential location.</p>\n<p>“We have things now like the former RDA properties that we managed to hang on to that we can use as a place to provide services to start a beginning community center,” Farr said. “In the future, I’d like to see a big capital campaign where we ultimately would build a really big, new, beautiful community center, and knock these other old buildings down, and have something that would really work with the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, town hall meetings such as Monday’s, where “a broad section of the community [was] represented,” are vital for pushing forward the implementation of concrete plans for Isla Vista’s autonomy.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s terrible it’s taken these tragic events of this year and Deltopia, but there’s been so much renewed energy and focus now on Isla Vista that it is all positive,” Farr said. “I think the future is better and looking up, and I think it’s working at a positive direction.”</p>\n<p><em>The next Isla Vista town hall meeting is scheduled for October 7, 2014. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Office of the EVPLA</em></p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The task force will oversee efforts made system-wide to prevent sexual violence and will allow various UC campuses to share effective practices in regard to sexual assault prevention, response and education.</p>\n<p>According to UCOP spokesperson Dianne Klein, the formation of the task force was not mandated by the policy update, but came directly from Napolitano.</p>\n<p>“Sexual violence is a serious crime that we will never tolerate,” Napolitano said in a statement. “The mission of this new task force is to continue to review and improve our efforts to make sure the University of California employs innovative, evidence-based and consistent practices across the system.”</p>\n<p>The task force is comprised of 23 individuals from nine undergraduate campuses and UCOP, — including three UC Regents — and will meet via teleconference every two to three weeks and twice a month in person in July and September. A report regarding the task force will be presented to the Regents during the upcoming July 16-17 meeting.</p>\n<p>According to Ricardo Alcaino, Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment, while each UC campus is unique and has different needs to consider when responding to sexual assault, some standardization throughout the UC system is “still feasible.”</p>\n<p>“Having some minimum requirements around education for incoming students, ongoing education throughout a student’s time on any campus, and on-campus advocates for survivors could be some areas where campuses could be held to the same standards,” Alcaino said in an email.</p>\n<p>The task force could also create “meaningful change” if it lead to the establishment of some standardization of guidelines for sexual assault response for students, staff and faculty, according to Alcaino.</p>\n<p>“There simply cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to this work,” Alcaino said in an email, “but having resources that campuses can share and use is a reasonable goal for the Task Force.”</p>\n<p>According to Jill Dunlap, director of Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education and Women’s Center programs, UCSB’s GauchoFYI program is a good example of a practice that could be shared with other campuses via the task force.</p>\n<p>“[It] is a stellar example of collaboration among different departments, including the CARE program,” Dunlap said in an email. “We think requiring first-year and transfer students to go through comprehensive, in-person alcohol and sexual violence prevention programming within their first six weeks of school is important.”</p>\n<p>Alcaino also said the collaboration between CARE and the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment has “proven to be an effective model for the [UC] system to emulate.”</p>\n<p>Savannah Badalich, a fourth-year international development studies major at UCLA and one of two undergraduate students on the task force, said despite her excitement over the “freaking amazing” formation of the task force, more student representation is needed.</p>\n<p>“There should be more students,” Badalich said. “I was kind of hoping that there would be one [student representative] from each school … this is a student issue, there should be a student majority on that task force.”</p>\n<p>Bailey Loverin, third-year literature major and Associated Students Student Advocate General, also said there should be more student involvement with the task force.</p>\n<p>“I’m also concerned about the apparent lack of student feedback on this task force … [four] student voices is not enough here. The UC system has over 200,000 students. You can’t simplify that to [four] representatives,” Loverin said in an email. “I’d like to see at least two reps from each school, preferably representatives nominated by their student body.”</p>\n<p>In regard to the number of student voices on the task force, Klein affirmed that students are represented and said for any task force to be effective it “can’t be too large,” although she could not comment on the how the members of the task force were selected.</p>\n<p>Badalich also said she hopes the task force will recommend additional funding, particularly for mental health resources for sexual assault survivors.</p>\n<p>“What students need are resources, especially mental health resources … that is stuff that requires money,” Badalich said. “That’s sort of the factor. You can say all you want in support of a cause, but if you don’t give money towards it, it doesn’t mean crap. So we’ll see, I hope one of the recommendations will be giving funding.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Wednesday, June 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article identified Jill Dunlap as the director of the Women’s Center for Sexual and Gender Equality.

The meeting began with a seven-minute moment of silence held in honor of the shooting victims.</p>\n<p>Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones reported on the successful efforts coordinated by A.S. executive officers to construct a board for students and community members to share thoughts and feelings in light of recent events. Jones said the board has received non-stop participation, particularly after media coverage in Isla Vista has subsided.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really, really beautiful thing,” Jones said. “We spent all day yesterday and today out there. It’s been a constant flow of students [and] community leaders … who are just coming forth, looking at it, participating, adding thoughts.”</p>\n<p>Third-year economics and accounting major and Internal Vice President Angela Lau said she has been working on several events to help students heal from the recent tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working nonstop from Saturday on the candlelight vigil, the memorial and other projects of healing on our campus,” Lau said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh discussed some of the problems that occurred with the UCSB emergency email message system on the Friday night of the shootings. Singh said Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown justified the delayed warnings students received that evening as an attempt to maintain peace.</p>\n<p>“He tried to make an excuse, and said something along the lines of ‘There was a safety concern, we didn’t want people to panic,’” Singh said. “To me, speaking personally, this kind of concerns me because this alert system is made for us to be notified for something like this going on.”</p>\n<p>Singh, a third-year political science and film and media double major, said students frequently receive alerts and warnings about relatively unimportant happenings.</p>\n<p>“We get police alerts all the time for smaller stuff, but we don’t get it when something like this happens,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Singh also said students should make a concerted effort to be aware of issues related to gun legislation.</p>\n<p>“With everything that’s been happening, just keep an eye on what’s going on with gun law legislations,” Singh said. “I know that’s been really big, especially [Tuesday] with the memorial. Today, Das Williams proposed his legislation and it was on CNN, so keep an eye on it. It’s something that’s relevant to our community.”</p>\n<p>Several different A.S. executive officers made efforts to reach out to senators to provide emotional support. A.S. President Ali Guthy, a third-year sociology and psychology double major, said she appreciated community efforts over the last week and would be available as a resource to senators and students.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s been a really rough week, and the amount of support we’ve been giving each other as a community has really been inspiring,” Guthy said. “I love you all. If you need anything I’m here as a resource.”</p>\n<p>Senators then passed a resolution to formally request that Chancellor Henry T. Yang ask First Lady Michelle Obama to appear at UCSB and speak on the recent tragedy. Senator Jimmy Villarreal, fourth-year communication major, said the first lady could provide support to the Isla Vista community during a difficult time.</p>\n<p>“In light of the most recent events, we need an inspirational speaker,” Villarreal said. “She will not be coming as a political figure, but as first lady of the United States. I like to think that’s like the mom of America. That’s what we need.”</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, fifth-year biological anthropology major Josh Plotke spoke at public forum to condemn newly appointed External Vice President of Local Affairs Beatrice Contreras for lying to the <em>Daily Nexus</em>, citing documented contradictory statements. He said Contreras, a third-year sociology and Asian-American studies double major, made incorrect statements regarding the legality of a sales tax and subsequently lied about making those statements.</p>\n<p>“Not only is it as bad as they said, not only did they quote her correctly, but it’s worse than they actually quoted her,” Plotke said. “I want you guys to just think before you take what she says as the truth. Just remember that she lied to the <em>Nexus</em>, she lied to me.”</p>\n<p>On former Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet’s request, Lau asked Plotke to leave for the remaining duration of the meeting, to which Plotke obliged.</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed included debate over Senate approval of staff positions for A.S. executives, planned study jams this evening at the A.S. Annex that will provide free food for students, a bill to create a commemorative memorial plaque for the victims of the shooting and the unanimous passage of a resolution to encourage more socially responsible investments by the UC, which had previously been passed unanimously by the outgoing Senate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/","id":3016,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3015,3014,3013],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":138,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
