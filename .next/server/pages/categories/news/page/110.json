A panel of women comprised of two Planned Parenthood representatives, two Student Health representatives and two UCSB Women’s Center representatives discussed a variety of different methods for birth control. The six women dispelled common myths about each type of birth control, answered questions from attendees and demonstrated the usage of certain contraceptives with plastic models.</p>\n<p>Events for Love Your Body Week include pumpkin carving on Wednesday, a Zumba lesson on Thursday and a henna and body art activity taking place on Friday.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Marisa Allan said she attended the event to inquire about birth control pills and came away with knowledge on various other forms of birth control such as an Internal Uterine Device (IUD).</p>\n<p>“I like the open discussion because it takes the ‘sex is bad’ stigma away from talking about this,” Allan said. “I’d rather everyone be informed than regret something they might do.”</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Tao Nguyen, who tabled for Love Your Body Week on Monday, said she volunteered to be a part of the event because she wanted to be involved in an organization that provided “outreach for anyone.” According to Nguyen, loving your body includes loving your physical body as well as your sexuality.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65620\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"245826282\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65626\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65620\" data-attachment-id=\"65620\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/love-your-body-week-to-spread-positivity-and-knowledge/contraception_riley-esguerra-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Riley Esguerra\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445319867\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"58\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Contraception_Riley Esguerra-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65620\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65620\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“Society and the media affect the way we view ourselves in terms of … our own body and sexuality,” Nguyen said. “There’s this standard of heterosexual, feminine females and masculine males, which are the two types that are portrayed, but there is so much diversity that we shouldn’t just be accepting our own but cut others, too.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Lauren Paiste said she attended the discussion to learn more about basic contraceptive methods.</p>\n<p>“The open discussion was nice; I felt more comfortable because everyone was talking,” Paiste said.</p>\n<p>Second-year biology and sociology double-major and a student staff member for the Women’s Center Eyra Dordi said Love Your Body Week is about “body positivity” and the discussions surrounding it.</p>\n<p>“We think [body positivity] is really important at the Women’s Center, specifically to women, but also to absolutely everybody; the way that people’s bodies are talked about, and the way they’re controlled,” Dordi said.</p>\n<p>For more information on Love Your Body Week check the Love Your Body Week Facebook event hosted by the UCSB Women’s Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to the new policy, any University employee who is not a “confidential resource” — including resident assistants, teaching assistants and any other student employees</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who hears about possible sexual assault must notify the Title IX office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a draft of the policy sent to UC campuses, University of California Office of the President (UCOP) has asked faculty, staff and students from all UC campuses to review the 25-page policy and submit comments by the end of October, after which UC’s Policy Work Group will review the suggestions and complete a final draft by January 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UConsent Coordinator, Take Back the Night Co-Chair and fourth-year global and feminist studies double-major Ashley Morgan helped organize the forum and said it was important to hold an event during which a variety of people could have their voices heard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted different perspectives from all different groups and backgrounds,” Morgan said. “Because we are educated on [the policy], we might not be able to come up with questions or not be able to get out of a certain tunnel vision, so it’s great to have all these different perspectives telling us what their concerns are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Director of C.A.R.E. Briana Conway said organizations need to hear specific student needs in order to best serve them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best of intentions — through policy and administration — if [they are] not speaking to the population who we’re trying to serve, then we’re failing,” Conway said. “I love opportunities like this where we can bridge administration’s best efforts with what really speaks to our student population.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Graduate Student Association Vice President of Committees and Planning Timothy Irvine</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who helped organize the event, the new policy would mean that survivors who do not wish to report an incident would have fewer options for confidants, seeing as many people are now required to report such information to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It reduces the amount of people who the survivor can confide in because they know if they do confide in this person, they’re putting them in a terribly awkward position,” Irvine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Jennifer Selvidge said it creates a unique problem for graduate students and teaching assistants who may be friends with their undergraduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as graduate students and we as TAs should not be mandatory reporters so that students do have an option to confide in their friends and people they may view as their friends, like their TAs,” Selvidge said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title IX coordinator Ricardo Alcaíno said the policy would not automatically lead the Title IX office to pursue the case if, for example, more damage would be caused to the survivor by launching an investigation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not like if someone is a responsible employee and they report it, we’re off to the races,” Alcaíno said. “It’s so no students on campus feel like there’s nothing to do. That’s the most important thing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Morgan, one of the “largest weaknesses” of the proposal is the absence of a mandatory minimum suspension for perpetrators. During a 13-hour sit-in in May, #NowUCSB campaigned for a four-quarter minimum suspension of students convicted of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irvine said the document should include mandatory minimum suspensions to warn students that there will be serious actions taken against perpetrators of sexual violence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of this is that people would know there will be consequences, because, so often, there are no consequences,” Irvine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcaíno</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said that a mandatory suspension may impact whether or not survivors choose to report an incident.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most survivors want to know what’s going to happen to the respondent,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcaíno</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said. “That may determine if they’re going to come forward or how much they’re going to tell us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said the efforts of students, including the #NowUCSB sit-in, are resulting in more progressive policies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am so proud and honored to be a part of UCSB,” Conway said. “Students are at the center of all of this. I think student activism is what’s driving change at a large university.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The forum’s organizers plan to set up a public Google Doc where anyone can suggest changes to the policy draft.

F&amp;B) met Monday in the UCen State Street room to consider 10 funding requests from nine campus organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee began its meeting with $34,000 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $6,665.26 in Senate unallocated, $45,000 in Student Initiated Outreach Program, $45,000 in Culture Weeks and Graduations, $27,000 for sports teams and $17,164 for academic teams. A.S. F&amp;B fully granted five requests, partially granted one request, tabled two requests and declined funding for one request.</p>\n<p>Kapatirang Pilipino (KP) requested $730 for Filipino Visibility Week, which begins Nov. 9 and will include an open-mic night, a parol (Filipino Christmas lantern) making workshop, a Justice for Filipino-Americans March in L.A., a carnival and Filipino cuisine throughout the week.</p>\n<p>A KP representative said the week’s events will portray the academic, cultural, social and political pillars of the organization.</p>\n<p>“We try to have events that really enforce the pillars of our organization, so we are here to ask for funding for our Filipino Visibility Week,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>The committee fully funded the group on the condition that the $160 initially requested for decorations and arts and crafts would be used solely for parol-making supplies.</p>\n<p>American Indian Student Mentor Association representatives Dayoung Yun and Marisol Alamillo requested $6,000 for their annual harvest festival.</p>\n<p>Yun said the annual festival is for native students and allies who are unable to go home for the holidays. According to Yun, the goal of the festival is to celebrate native identity and unite native students with their culture.</p>\n<p>“The event originated in 1975 when some native students couldn’t go home for Thanksgiving, so we began to offer an alternative for those students,” Yun said. “It’s a safe space for our native students and allies and every student is welcome to attend.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request until next week to discuss the use of the organization’s one-time exception clause in the allocation of funds.</p>\n<p>Pi Sigma Rho representative Bharat Raman requested $170 for an outreach barbeque.</p>\n<p>Raman said the event is for potential members of the physics honors society.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of this event would be to interact with prospective new members, get people to join,” Raman said. “We’re speaking to freshman physics classes which have hundreds of students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Vice-Chair and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said the committee cannot fund “recruitment events.”</p>\n<p>“Since the event is for physics students with certain requirements, it is more of a recruitment event than an open-student event,” Ninh said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted unanimously to decline funding to the organization based on the nature of the event.</p>\n<p>Cultura Arts representative Marla Arciniega requested $705 to fund their annual Dia de los Muertos event.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the event.</p>\n<p>Japanese Language Cafe representatives Kai Kawashina and Sheila Ho requested $98 to hold a Uri Uri workshop and karaoke night/potluck.</p>\n<p>Kawashina said the events are a way for American students learning about Japanese culture or language to interact with international students from Japan.</p>\n<p>“The students from Japan can teach the American students who are learning Japanese or Japanese culture,” Kawashina said. “It’s a community to learn about Japanese culture using Japanese language”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to bundle and fully fund the two events.</p>\n<p>UCSBreaking representatives Christina Chong, Chris Pom and Steven Hu requested $1,350 to host a breakdancing competition at UCSB. They requested $1050 for judges and DJs, and $300 for prize money.</p>\n<p>Hu said the event is a way the group to gain recognition as a breakdancing club.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great way to get people interested in our club and it allows us to expand our club,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to partially fund their request, excluding the prize money, because it is against precedent to allot prize money to an organization.</p>\n<p>Lambda Sigma Gamma requested $1,300 to hold a Mr. Greek Universe pageant to raise money for their national philanthropy: California Head Start Program. The event is open to all of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>A Lambda Sigma Gamma student representative said the event is a way to encourage inter-Greek relations while raising money for a cause that helps young students across the state.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the fundraiser event, under the condition that all UCSB would be free to participate and attend the event.</p>\n<p>Afrikan Black Coalition student representatives Gold Okafor and Odera Anakwenze requested $30,000 for an annual Afrikan Black Coalition Conference held on Feb. 12 to Feb. 14 that spans the whole UC system. It was last held at UCSB in 2007 with 400 people. This year, Afrikan Black Coalition anticipates 900 people will be in attendance.</p>\n<p>Okafor said the conference is a way for black students on campus to gather as a community and learn about the way their community interacts with the world. Students will also learn from prominent black public figures about future professional success. Student will learn about the theme of the event, “Planting the seeds of the future, planning our next steps.“</p>\n<p>“It’s really important that black people on our campus and anyone in our community feel welcome here and are able to see each other and really flourish,” Okafor said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the event, with $15,000 from the OSL funds and $15,000 from the Culture weeks and graduation funds for the Winter 2016 quarter.</p>\n<p>Health and Wellness Liaisons for the Residence Hall Association (RHA) Jose Magana and Paloma Hinojosa requested $2,474 to install condom dispensers in each of UCSB’s residential halls. Currently, students in the residence halls may obtain condoms by requesting them from their hall’s Safe Sex Peer or Residence Hall Advisors.</p>\n<p>Magana and Hinojosa said the goal of the dispensers would be to make condoms more accessible for the general student body and promote safer sex.</p>\n<p>“There’s a stigma for going to another person to get a condom, even the Safe Sex Peers, and we want to eliminate that stigma. We want to put the dispensers somewhere where all students will have access to them.”</p>\n<p>The committee had concerns about the safety of the dispensers, and voted to table the request indefinitely as A.S. representative works collaboratively with RHA to create a safer, more functional condom dispenser plan.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65576\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/a-s-financial-and-business-committee-allocates-funds-to-six-student-groups-this-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65576\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/a-s-financial-and-business-committee-allocates-funds-to-six-student-groups-this-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/a-s-financial-and-business-committee-allocates-funds-to-six-student-groups-this-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/a-s-financial-and-business-committee-allocates-funds-to-six-student-groups-this-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/a-s-financial-and-business-committee-allocates-funds-to-six-student-groups-this-week/","id":2663,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2662,2661,2660],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Wrap Up Oct. 13-20","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=512%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Last week (Oct. 13-20) law enforcement units in Isla Vista responded to a residential burglary, a rooftop accident on Del Playa Road and a prowler outside a residence on Pasado Road.

The suspect had 22 images of a victim on his phone, taken from outside through the victim’s window. The victim signed a citizen’s arrest for the prowling, and IVFP deputies also added peeping to the suspect’s charges.</p>\n<p>On Thursday evening, medical response teams arrived on Del Playa Road to attend to a UC Santa Barbara student who had fallen off a roof. The reporting party stated the victim, a male they met earlier in the evening, was walking on the roof of his residence when he unexpectedly fell.  The victim was conscious and talking when medics transported him to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 13, deputies responded to a residential burglary on Camino Del Sur.  The victim stated his laptop was stolen off the couch near the front door of his apartment, which he had left unlocked.

At Saturday’s launch event, participants shared ideas and recommendations for the community center’s role and services. The center is set to be complete spring 2017.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, I.V. residents are “extremely enthusiastic” about the project.</p>\n<p>“They have formed committees to work on different aspects of it,” Farr said. “We are certainly encouraging their participation and input into all faces of it. My mantra has just been that we really want to keep the project moving forward and as on budget and on time as possible.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs Paola Dela Cruz said the community center launched after decades of inactivity due to support from the county.</p>\n<p>“I think [the community center] has to do with the opportunity that the county has given us to actually own — for the community to own — this building,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said another reason for the project’s increased momentum is a community response to challenges I.V. has recently faced.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, I think it also has to do with other events that have happened in our community which have raised awareness about the issues that we have here,” Dela Cruz said. “We do need county resources, we do need the university to invest money, we do need residents to take ownership.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Sue Whisenand said she hopes I.V. residents of all ages and backgrounds use the community center for a variety of purposes.</p>\n<p>“For me, I see it being multigenerational,” Whisenand said. “I see it being a place where we have food events that help with building good nutrition and eating habits, and I see places where we can have different shows, and I see a pleasant place where maybe there are some parenting classes.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdock also said she wants the center to serve all I.V. communities.</p>\n<p>“I envision it as a location for flexible activities where various groups can request use of the building, and I hope it is used for residents, students and all age groups,” Murdock said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she was happy to see people come together to celebrate the project’s launch and show interest in its progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m so glad to see that throughout this process different communities have been able to come together and to talk,” Dela Cruz said. “At the beginning I think it is difficult because we all have different ideas and perspectives … but it’s nice to just see, look at this, we did it together.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Other activities throughout the event included a butterfly exhibit, a bounce house and a soccer game with police. Various businesses throughout I.V. offered flyer coupons to Meet Your Neighbors Day attendees.</p>\n<p>The new community center on Embarcadero del Mar opened Oct. 17, serving as an art exhibition for the day. The center displayed photographs, paintings and sculptures as well as a stage for an open mic session, a zumba class and yoga.</p>\n<p>Curator for the art exhibition and third-year art major Robert Perez said opening the Community Center on Meet Your Neighbors Day was beneficial for both events to attract a large crowd.</p>\n<p>“We want to attract as many people as possible to every event,” Perez said. “There’s so much going on today, there’s stages out in Anisq’Oyo’ Park and everywhere, so we thought it made sense to unify everything under Meet Your Neighbor Day.”</p>\n<p>Graduate student Aaron Howard said he showcased seven of his photographs of I.V. in the day-long art gallery at the community center.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think it’s a good way to bring people together and expose people’s work,” Howard said.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Taylor Nguyen said she appreciates the art exhibited being part of Meet Your Neighbors Day.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to see the artistic side of the community. I think that is something that is not always highlighted at events, but to see student artwork has been really impressive,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>Second-year mathematics major Gabriel Pragin said he helped organize Meet Your Neighbors Day and the community center launch. According to Pragin, it is very rewarding to see the event come together and I.V. residents enjoying themselves in the parks.</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to get us all to work together and be friends and meet each other in parks and have a good time listening to music, looking at art,” Pragin said. “It’s a way to get together and just be a community and support each other and have fun together.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna and intern with the Christian organization Real Life Samantha Urena said Meet Your Neighbors Day is a good opportunity to develop stronger relationships within the community.</p>\n<p>“[Meet Your Neighbors Day] create[s] more of a community of respect and compassion and bonding over having some fun on a Saturday afternoon, not just getting drunk and making more acquaintances, but actually becoming friends with some people,” Urena said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy major Philip Griffin said he enjoyed listening to music and being outdoors during the all-day event.</p>\n<p>“[Meet Your Neighbors Day] is a really important event,” Griffin said. “It’s such a small town and we’re all so close it would be nice to have some more events that really unify everyone and create an overall sense of unity and friendship and trust.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/","id":4645,"author":{"id":155,"name":"Zareena Zaidi"},"related":[4644,4643,4642],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students, Community Members Unite At Vigil For Andres Esteban Sanchez","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A crowd of over 100 people met outside the Associated Students Pardall Center Thursday night to honor UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez who passed away the morning of Sunday, Oct. 11.

School workshop Thursday evening in the Dolores Huerta Conference Room to share information on the resources available to first generation, underrepresented students pursuing graduate education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ Studies Department peer advisors Carmen Mares and Beatriz Cano geared the workshop toward students of color, providing information about the application process to obtain a master’s degree or a Ph.D. The presentations provided an overview about applying for financial aid, studying for the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) and making connections with faculty members to get into a desired graduate program. Current graduate students discussed potential routes to graduate school and personal circumstances which motivated them to continue their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-year Chican@ studies and Black studies double major Veronica Mandujano said she was compelled to attend this workshop because she does not know anyone who has gone to graduate school prior to the workshop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just want to know every resource available to me,” Mandujano said. “I want to know who I can link up with, and who can offer me information when I need it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandujano said the workshop offered several resources for attendees, including information about fellowships, paying for grad school and out-of-state schooling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a great presentation and I learned a lot but mainly planning ahead, planning as much as much as you can … and the different types of grad schools that are available,” Mandujano said. “Speaking to current grad students was just kind of a more personal time to understand their experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies teaching assistant Terri Cecchine said she went through the same experiences and felt it was her responsibility to relay information about the graduate school process to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am the first in my family to pursue a Ph.D., to receive a masters, so when I was approached by Carmen and Betty, of course I wanted to help out,” Cecchine said. “I have to help those that are following in the path that I have carved out for myself, it’s not easy for everyone to get here and so now that we are here, it’s really important that we network and give back, and give our wisdom.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cecchine, a low percentage of minority students acquire Ph.D.’s due to financial and social circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like it’s really hard given the obstacles that a lot of people of color are born into – the lack of resources, lack of network, lack of peer support and lack of parental support,” Cecchine said. “For whatever reason, all of those things are prominent in white communities or communities that don’t have financial stipulations, so they are obviously given a lot more access to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Carmen Mares said she held the workshop because she would like more guidance in applying to graduate school, and felt many other students were in the same position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a peer advisor here has helped me provide resources to other students, especially students that are Latino, Chicano that are first generation,” Mares said. “That’s a goal as a peer advisor to help other students like me that don’t really know what their career goals are at the moment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Beatriz Cano said her main goal was to reach out to first-generation students upon becoming a peer advisor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[My goal is] to reach out to Chicanos, to let them know that they weren’t alone, they didn’t have to struggle,” Cano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cano said she wanted to host the workshop because she was struggling to find resources to aid her graduate school application process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am pretty sure that people are interested in grad school and are struggling as bad as we are and so the purpose of this workshop is for us to help them and to help ourselves, to create this community,” Cano said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Crocker Professor at USC Gould School of Law, discussed the importance of art in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement in a lecture titled “Race, Rap, and Redemption: The Role of Art in Promoting Racial Justice” at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) Thursday evening.</p>\n<p>During the lecture, Armour explored how art forms such as gangster rap, shed light on important issues including racial profiling, police brutality and mass incarceration. Armour has been a member of USC’s faculty since 1995 and studies several topics regarding relationships between racial justice, criminal justice and law enforcement. The lecture is part of MCC’S “Race Matters” series, which focuses on the role of racism and race in our society.</p>\n<p>Armour began the lecture by outlining racial profiling and the various social injustices it causes. According to Armour, the indignity and embarrassment of being racially profiled can be likened to “murdering an individual’s spirit.” Amour said the case of Sandra Bland, a Black woman who died in police custody in July, illustrates the damages of racial profiling.</p>\n<p>“Before Sandra Bland died, she was spirit-murdered,” Armour said. “Whoever took her life, whether it was by her hands or their hands, she had been spirit murdered to lead up to that suicide.”</p>\n<p>According to Armour, influential figures in the black community perpetuate negative attitudes toward Black men, such as Bill Cosby lecturing young black men on “pulling up their pants” and “naming their kids right.” Armour also said he employs the word “nigga” to emphasize problematic issues in the Black community.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I use that term to talk about social issues is because it gets at a mentality in the Black community that is very ugly and needs to change,” Armour said.</p>\n<p>Armour said the first time he gave the “Race, Rap, and Redemption” lecture was in USC’s Bovard auditorium to discuss the Stanley Tookie Williams case. During the event, guests used dance and music to express their opinions of the trial.</p>\n<p>“If you want to reach people at a visceral level, I find that art is the most effective way to get people to begin to empathize with people they might otherwise not find anything in common with at all,” Armour said.</p>\n<p>According to Armour, rap is a form of art that addresses racial profiling and police brutality in a way most other music does not. Amour said rap groups Public Enemy and NWA showed the perspective of Black persons in police brutality cases.</p>\n<p>“This is profound stuff in the profane. You have coarse brutal language to describe a coarse brutal reality,” Armour said. “It was a political oppositional discourse as profane as you can imagine.”</p>\n<p>According to a member of an African-American women’s sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha Charlotte A. Gullap-Moore, one reason for the prevalence of racial insensitivity is the lack of Black history education in U.S. schools.</p>\n<p>“The more education you have the more currency you have,” Moore said. “The reason why Public Enemy was so relevant was because they educated themselves on Black history, which is not disseminated in the school system.”</p>\n<p>Moore said Black history education should be introduced to schools beginning in primary school.</p>\n<p>“This is a process that should be implemented since kindergarten, not just for Black people but for all people because then it will limit cultural insensitivity,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the “Race Matters” lecture series will continue throughout the school year.</p>\n<p>“We have great programs and I couldn’t be more thrilled with the calendar,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “This lecture [Race Rap and Redemption] was a way to kick-off the incoming year in a really critical, academic, engaging way.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously stated Charlotte A. Gullap-Moore is a representative of an African-American women’s sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. While Gullap-Moore is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha did not attend the lecture on behalf of the sorority.

Sustainability and UCSB alumna Tamara “TJ” DiCaprio discussed her role in reducing Microsoft’s carbon emissions in a talk titled ‘”Carbon Neutrality IS the Bottom Line: The Development and Success of Microsoft’s Innovative Carbon-Fee Model” Wednesday evening at Bren Hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio recounted the process of convincing Microsoft executives to work toward carbon emission reduction through an internal carbon fee model, which the corporation has now used for four years. DiCaprio also discussed Microsoft’s clean energy projects in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said the carbon fee model imposes fees on business units within Microsoft Corporation according to their carbon emissions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we do, technically speaking, is we cascade the price of carbon down through the different business units and then we collect the funds in the central pot and use all those funds for environmental initiatives to reach carbon neutrality,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said the internal carbon fee model is gaining recognition in business communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was just recently, a couple weeks ago, recognized by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an article in the business section, which means it’s getting mainstream,” DiCaprio said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to DiCaprio, it was difficult to gain support from Microsoft executives when first attempting to reduce the corporation’s carbon emissions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody would come to my meetings,” DiCaprio said. “When they did come to my meetings, they would come and do emails the whole time. I couldn’t capture anyone’s attention, let alone get engagement in their brains.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said she was able to secure the support of executives when she learned to “speak their language” and focus on the relationship between carbon emissions and money, which lead to the creation of the internal carbon fee model.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started thinking: Okay, I’m in a business, I’ve got to start talking in terms of dollars,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to DiCaprio, Microsoft also funds carbon-offset projects in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are not only reducing carbon in Kenya and emerging nations, but also taking money from developing countries and getting them out to the emerging nations to develop a low carbon economy,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said Microsoft’s nonprofit work is “changing peoples’ lives” by helping developing countries industrialize in a sustainable ways.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are able to allow them not only to plant trees, but also go build factories and sell clothes and manufacture clothing with Puma and then recycle money back to be able to build schools and hospitals for healthcare and get fresh water for people,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First-year environmental studies major TJ Keeling said DiCaprio’s talk showed her the potential effects of an individual’s work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It brought into prospective the impact you can have on the environment, and more of the benefits that actually show when you do work,” Keeling said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Katheryn Collins said the internal carbon fee model is surprisingly simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you hear about it, it makes so much logical sense but it’s not something that I’ve seen widely done,” Collins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Collins, corporations like Microsoft often create nonprofits to separate philanthropy from business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They do not want their projects on the side to be associated with their company,” Collins said. “I think this is a really interesting model that has captured the minds of the leadership so well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Jessica Perkins said she was surprised by Microsoft’s work in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To economically make that kind of impact on a community like that seems so far removed from what companies are able to actually accomplish,” Perkins said.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Fire Engine 11, which was staffed with one Captain, one Paramedic/Engineer and one Paramedic/Firefighter, was dispatched and responded from their station located at 6901 Frey Way (at Storke Rd.) in Goleta. Upon arrival, Firefighters were met by several agitated bystanders stating that the subject had cut his arm and needed help. Firefighters donned the appropriate protective equipment and approached the subject, where they found a combative male victim, around 20 years of age, being restrained on the ground by Sheriff’s Deputies who had arrived on scene prior to our arrival.</p>\n<p>Our Captain and Engineer assisted with restraining the subject, who was extremely combative, while the Paramedic/Firefighter began treatment and worked to control the bleeding. An American Medical Response (AMR) ambulance arrived on scene. The subject was placed onto a back board and restrained with soft restraints to prevent further injury to himself or to first responders. He was then transferred to the AMR ambulance and transported without delay to Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Our Firefighter/Paramedic rode to the hospital in the ambulance to assist with patient care. The Captain and Engineer remained on scene, at the request of Sheriff’s Deputies, to assist with cleanup at three different locations on Abrego Road. There was a large amount of blood on the street at these locations, which presented a biological hazard. The areas were cleaned with the use of Septisol and copious amounts of water.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Firefighters pride themselves in their professionalism while working with law enforcement and AMR to provide the highest standard of patient care. Our members treat every emergency with urgency and professionalism. Engine 11’s crew on October 11<sup>th</sup> included an experienced team of Firefighters and Paramedics. Every effort was made to provide the very best care and life saving measures for this young man.”</p>\n<p><em>For the original allegations:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/","id":4638,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4637,4636,4635],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Halloween Parking Restrictions and Noise Ordinances Discussed at City of Goleta Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The City of Goleta hosted a community meeting to discuss residential parking permits and noise ordinances for Halloween weekend in Isla Vista Thursday evening at Goleta City Hall.

At the meeting, community members discussed possible solutions to these issues, mainly temporary noise ordinance and parking permits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Police Department Lieutenant Mark Signa said the influx of vehicles during Halloween weekend has affected locals in past years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The parking has been a difficult thing for people who come out into the area and park in Goleta and take up valuable space that the residents are using,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said the City of Goleta and UCSB have collaborated to ensure that parking is available for I.V. residents and the students through a temporary permit system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goleta area’s restricted the parking to those who have permits, and the permits are given to the residents in the area,” Signa said. “Each resident, from Hollister Avenue to Southern Limit and from Cannon Green Drive to Storke Road, get two permits and can request more at the Neighborhood Service Department.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said the City of Goleta will implement a parking restriction from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Oct. 30 to Nov. 2, with restrictions on parts of Del Playa, Sabado Tarde, Trigo, Camino Del Sur, Camino Pescadero and El Embarcadero starting at 5 p.m. on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Signa, UCSB will offer discounted campus parking permits for those who wish to purchase one in preparation for Halloween weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What they’ve done to mitigate the problem with students living on Del Playa is that they’ve offered the students an opportunity to buy night weekend permits at a reduced rate, so they actually get a permit they can use for the rest of the year,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Rob Plastino said a noise ordinance will help ensure parties to not reach unmanageable levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been studies done that show that the sooner you shut down the music the sooner the party is over,” Plastino said. “As you close that gap between the times you allow it to the time you shut it down, you lessen the amount of drunken violence and fights that break out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Signa, the parking permit program and noise ordinance are intended to make Halloween a local event for I.V. residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What this has been very successful at doing is instead of creating large, open parties with two, three or five hundred people showing up and music blasting, it’s now smaller contained parties, local parties, where students are having parties with just their friends, smaller groups, hence less alcohol, less problems,” Signa said. “By keeping it local it stays contained.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department Lieutenant Butch Arnoldi said many people who visit I.V. for Halloween do not respect the local community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately people that are not from the area come up here and think that’s it free game for all kinds of assaults, physical assaults and sexual assaults,” Arnoldi said. “This is not the old west, people can’t come here from out of town and brutalize our people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said approximately 200 law enforcement officials will patrol I.V. during Halloween weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement for Isla Vista is going to consist of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s department, UCSB police department and we’re each going to have different areas that we’re going to be patrolling,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goleta Neighborhood Services and Public Safety Director Vytautas “Vyto” Adomaitis said the City of Goleta developed a parking permit program with community input and has received “overwhelming support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the feedback we got from the residents was, in fact, to do something about having permit parking in the area to help keep all of the outside visitors who come into the neighborhood and flood the area with vehicles,” Adomaitis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adomaitis said the City of Goleta will keep working to decrease the impact of Halloween weekend in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ll be reviewing these measures periodically and methodically like we do after every event,” Adomaitis said. “We find out what went wrong, what needs to be adjusted.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><div

More than 6,000 postdocs throughout the 10 UC campuses will have the chance to vote from Oct. 19 to 27 on whether to approve or reject the contract.</p>\n<p>If approved, the agreement would also require the University to form a new Family-Friendly Committee to explore how to reimburse postdocs for childcare.<br>\nUnion president and former UC Davis postdoc Anke Schennink said the union was able to remove any salary reductions from the agreement in the last hour of negotiations.</p>\n<p>“The University had proposed a number of different wage cuts, and they would basically lower the take-home pay for postdocs,” Schennink said. “That was definitely a point that was talked about until the last moment.”</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, postdocs will receive yearly raises based on the National Institute of Health’s inflation index.</p>\n<p>The amount of University assistance offered to international postdocs had also been a sticking point in previous negotiations, but Schennink said the contract’s new terms on international postdocs is one of the “important improvements” over the previous contract.</p>\n<p>“For example, in case of the termination of a postdoc, the University will assist in helping the postdoc to get a travel visa to come back for a hearing if a postdoc has to leave the country because of this,” Schennink said.</p>\n<p>According to Schennink, the contract also expands postdocs’ healthcare coverage.</p>\n<p>“The plans will be at the same cost or slightly cheaper, but the new healthcare plan will be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, which is important basically for the reason that preventative care and contraception will be available with no co-pay,” Schennink said.</p>\n<p>Schennink said she thought the threat of postdocs authorizing a strike coerced the University to make some concessions.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think [the strike] has been important and that resulted in the improvements that we have now, but the University will not talk about that,” Schennink said.</p>\n<p>Schennink said in a previous Daily Nexus article titled “Postdoc Student Union Makes Case for Fair Pay, Job Security” that members of UC’s negotiating team “don’t respect postdocs.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s materials department postdoc and Santa Barbara unit chair for the union Patrick Callahan said postdocs do “all kinds of things,” including guiding graduate students through school and doing in-depth research.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, UCSB is a research university and postdocs are pretty important to getting high-level research done,” Callahan said. “They’re people who already have PhDs, so they are highly trained.”</p>\n<p>Postdoctoral researchers often work under the direction of a professor while training for a faculty position, according to analyst Billy Ko, who works in UCSB’s academic personnel department.</p>\n<p>“Postdocs typically spend five years getting training and mentorship with a faculty member,” Ko said.</p>\n<p>Callahan said because the terms included many improvements that he and other postdocs were pushing for, he expected a majority of postdocs to approve the contract.</p>\n<p>“Everyone I’ve talked to is happy that we’ve reached a tentative agreement … So I would imagine it’s going to be exactly the same, where the majority of the postdocs support the agreement that the bargaining team got for us,” Callahan said. “I have to imagine that a majority of postdocs will be voting to ratify the agreement.”</p>\n<p>Schennink said although the union accomplished many of its goals, members still have issues to address during next year’s negotiations.</p>\n<p>“We would definitely like to make further improvements in family-friendly benefits and gender equity in the University,” Schennink said. “There can be a lot of improvements there. That’s definitely something that will stay on the agenda for next year.”</p>\n<p>If the new agreement is ratified, it will be effective until Sept. 30, 2016.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/uc-postdocs-negotiate-for-better-benefits-rights/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/uc-postdocs-negotiate-for-better-benefits-rights/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/uc-postdocs-negotiate-for-better-benefits-rights/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/uc-postdocs-negotiate-for-better-benefits-rights/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/uc-postdocs-negotiate-for-better-benefits-rights/","id":3647,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[3646,3645,3644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Gaskin was President of West Valley College for three years prior to her appointment as SBCC’s President in July 2012. Gaskin focused on a variety of issues including fiscal transparency for the college, campus facility modernization and addressing SBCC student concerns in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said her decision to retire was partially due to SBCC’s positive accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for the Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, a major focus during her presidency was to close the student achievement gap between different ethnicities.</p>\n<p>“We’ve received several funds to experiment and launch innovative programs to close that gap or disparity,” Gaskin said. “We’ve also ramped up our academic counseling support. We had one of the higher ratios in the state when it came to student academic counseling ratios.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of SBCC Jack Friedlander said Gaskin smoothly transitioned into her role during her first year of presidency.</p>\n<p>“She came in and calmed the waters at the college and in the community and helped reestablish relationships internally and externally,” Friedlander said “She didn’t come in with a preconceived agenda”.</p>\n<p>According to Friedlander, the recruitment process for a new president is in its early stages.</p>\n<p>“We have a profile of what the ideal candidate would bring,” Friedlander said. “Particularly, people who apply write an essay to write about how their experiences and characteristics align with what we’re looking for and how they would deal with the challenges our campus is facing.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Students President and second-year business administration major Isaac Eaves said Gaskin listened to student voices on campus.</p>\n<p>“She always had the time to communicate with students and build a connection,” Eaves said. “She’s been working hard to make sure that we have a voice because in the past — there’s been a lot of micromanaging from the Board of Trustees and down.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Student Trustee and political science and sociology double major Tyler Gibson said Gaskin has addressed issues regarding “Measure S,” a bond proposition authorizing funds to improve campus facilities.</p>\n<p>“In 2014, we tried to improve [SBCC’s] infrastructure,” Gibson said. “[Gaskin] addressed concerns because of Measure S. We’ve tried to strategize ways to continue to be an effective community campus while keeping the faculty and students in mind.”</p>\n<p>Gibson said many students were surprised about Gaskin’s announcement.</p>\n<p>“Most people that I’ve talked to said ‘No way,’ ‘Wait when? Next year? Didn’t she just get here?’” Gibson said. “She’s somebody I look up to, so it was very shocking to see her announcing about retiring.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said one of the defining moments in her career as president was the events of May 23 last year in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If there was one moment that has been set apart from all the others, it is the tragic loss of lives in Isla Vista,” Gaskin said. “It is the antithesis of what anyone wants from our students. Learning and teaching is a truly special endeavor, and for something like that to happen is an assault to the core of who we are.”<br>\nGaskin said she hopes to travel after her retirement.</p>\n<p>“I want to have the time to travel,” Gaskin said. “I’ve never taken a trip in the 35 years in September or October. It would be so unusual to travel then.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/","id":4636,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[4635,4634,4633],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":110,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
