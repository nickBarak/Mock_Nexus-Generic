Any individual can register and participate, and at the first Dance Marathon event held last year, hundreds of dancers participated and raised around $13,000 for Cottage Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biological science major and co-chair of Dance Marathon Molly Morrison said there are over 250 college campuses that put on dance marathons, making Dance Marathon the largest collegiate philanthropy effort in the nation.</p>\n<p>“I helped found dance marathon, but our first event wasn’t until last March 1,” Morrison said in an email. “This year, we have 600 students registered to go to the event, and our goal is $25,000.”</p>\n<p>According to Morrison, the event raises money for the Children’s Miracle Network hospitals, specifically the Cottage Children’s Hospital in downtown Santa Barbara, which, according to Morrison, is an essential part of healthcare on the central coast.</p>\n<p>“Cottage Children’s Hospital is the only hospital with a level 2 neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric intensive care unit in central California, making this hospital a vital one for many families in the state,” Morrison said in an email.</p>\n<p>At the Dance Marathon event, food will be provided and participants will be split into teams, each representing a different patient from the Cottage Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>“The food is catered, entertainment is provided, including student DJs, a cappella groups, and dance groups from the UCSB campus,” Morrison said. “In addition, dancers are split into color teams, with a child ambassador from Cottage Children’s Hospital on their team. It’s a great way for UCSB students to make a tangible difference in their community during their time here, and to see exactly where the money they raised is going.”</p>\n<p>According to Morrison, Dance Marathon aims to expand even more in the coming years.</p>\n<p>“We are very excited to see our growth from last year to this year, and to see how dance marathon can grow on this campus, and perhaps one day be the philanthropy by what UCSB is known for!” Morrison said.</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Claire Meyer said she just joined Dance Marathon this year and that the group has been preparing for the event for the past few months.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working for months with fundraising,” Meyer said, “I can’t wait to meet the kids and families that we are fundraising for. My brother did a dance marathon at Ohio State and he said it was one of the most awesome experiences of his college career.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/","id":2855,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2854,2853,2852],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB To Fund Cliffside Fence","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fencing_Brendan-Mansfield.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fencing_Brendan-Mansfield.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB announced Tuesday that it will provide $70,000 to Santa Barbara County for the construction of permanent fences along the bluffs in Isla Vista.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h4>After numerous falls and months of delay, university pledges to pay for project’s full cost</h4>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61355\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61355\" data-attachment-id=\"61355\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/ucsb-to-fund-cliffside-fence/fencing_brendan-mansfield/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fencing_Brendan-Mansfield.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422855519\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Fencing\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fencing_Brendan-Mansfield.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fencing_Brendan-Mansfield.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61355\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fencing_Brendan-Mansfield.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Isla Vistans lean against the old wooden fence along a stretch of Del Playa bluffs, with temporary orange fencing behind them.

A more permanent solution—of wood fences up to four-and-a-half feet tall—will be supported by $70,000 from UCSB, the university announced Tuesday. <em>Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB announced Tuesday that it will provide $70,000 to Santa Barbara County for the construction of permanent fences along the bluffs in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The university said it will cover the entire estimated cost for the installation of the fences and has agreed that if the project comes in under budget, the remaining funds will be used by the county for maintaining the fence. The fences will run from the end of Del Playa Open Space Park to Walter Capps Park and will include all parks owned by the county and the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD). Once the fence is completed, the county will assume responsibility for future maintenance and repairs.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s involvement in the fencing project since the death of multiple students from <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/cliff-fall-victim-paralyzed-from-waist-down/\">cliff falls</a> in 2013 has largely contributed to the university’s decision to provide funding to the county.</p>\n<p>“Chancellor Yang has been deeply involved in this project since the beginning, when Molly Morrison founded Fence Isla Vista, and since we lost students to cliff-related deaths and injuries,” Schunk said. “Yang has taken a very active and involved role in this entire effort so I think part of it was him pushing it and making it a top priority.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biological sciences major and Fence I.V. founder Molly Morrison said she founded her organization, which aims to improve current fencing standards along the cliffs on Del Playa Drive, after her friend and <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/woman-found-on-isla-vista-beach-identified-as-cal-poly-slo-student/\">Cal Poly SLO student Giselle Ayala</a>, along with three other students, died after falling from the cliffs since April 2013.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s extremely vital to make these occurrences as preventable as possible,” Morrison said. “I do believe the personal responsibility is also an extremely vital aspect in these scenarios, but there is work to be done on both ends to help end these tragedies.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said she believes the university decided to fund the project due to Santa Barbara county’s historical lack of funding to improve fencing along the I.V. cliffs.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that they have been inactive, but that it has taken so long to find a source of funding that should normally be very fast, as fencing is one of the largest safety concerns in Santa Barbara area,” Morrison said. “[UCSB’s contribution] is extremely helpful, as it is funding the entire project. I am so grateful for the generous donors who have dedicated their resources to help make this place safer.”</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD general manager Rodney Gould, the university’s contribution to the project is critical to its timely completion because the project was not a budgeted expense for the district and therefore was difficult to fund. Gould said construction should begin shortly given the end of the permitting process.</p>\n<p>“I know the funding has been received by the County and they are in discussions with a contractor,” Gould said in an email. “My best guess, and it is only a guess, is that construction will begin in the next few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the fences installed along the bluffs will be three-ring wood fences up to 54 inches high with diamond-shaped, nylon-coated chain links to prevent someone from being able to climb over the fence.</p>\n<p>“The idea for the small diamonds is so you can’t fit your hands or toes into it easily and climb over it,” Schunk said. “The thing to keep in mind is we aren’t going for a high security fence because we’re looking at prevention.”</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said the university and the county have been working on installing I.V. bluff fencing since last Fall and that the recent funding will finally ensure the project’s completion.</p>\n<p>“I asked the chancellor last October in a letter to fund a couple of county projects, starting with the bluff fencing, and the county said that we would do the maintenance once it was installed,” Farr said. “It’s on our agenda for next week so I’m really happy to see that it’s finally coming together.”</p>\n<p>Farr also said the county wants to make open park spaces on DP as safe as possible in light historical cliff falls resulting in the death of multiple students since 2005.</p>\n<p>“We warn people about the danger of the bluffs and although there have always been some kind of a fence up there to deter people, they either obey the signs or go around the fencing and walk on the other side,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, many individuals do not take into account that the cliffs’ eroding nature make their edges particularly dangerous for people treading the Del Playa bluffs.</p>\n<p>“People also need to understand that the geologic material of those bluffs are very erosive so they’re constantly crumbling away. I think that’s another reason why people might make the mistake sometimes and think there’s more property on the other side of the fence than there really is,” Farr said. “So we’re constantly monitoring it from a public safety standpoint from the beach side as well as from the upper side.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while the university’s contribution is helpful, he hopes it is more than a one-time effort to improve safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I hope this influx of funds towards I.V. and level of attention is not temporary because of the events last spring, but history tells us it is,” Abboud said in an email. “I’m optimistic that this time around we can come up with a long term solution that keeps everyone involved and helping better Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Cameron Schunk stating a preference for a high security fence. Schunk actually said the fence were for prevention, not high security purposes.

The research has taken place in several academic subjects including sociology and communication over the course of 11 total lectures.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year electrical engineering major and A.S. controller Amir Khazaieli, research is still in its experimental stage but the goal of A.S. is to eventually offer a medium that would allow one to become more engaged with their lectures.</p>\n<p>“This is a very, very extensive project that has been in the works for over a year,” Khazaieli said. “Half of it is just providing new tools in lecture to gather information. The other half of it is to provide an interface for students to be able to collaboratively edit and review this information.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said while the Google Doc program is still in its “inception” phase, the program offers a wide variety of benefits to students.</p>\n<p>“The notes that come out of this kind of situation have proven to be a lot more complete, in the sense that a lot more thought-driven analysis goes into what they’re [students are] hearing rather than trying to frantically copy and paste everything that’s said,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>However, classics professor Helen Morales said she prohibits A.S. from passing out flyers promoting the program outside her Greek Mythology lecture because the program allegedly violates UC policy on lecture material distribution.</p>\n<p>“In a nutshell, the A.S. shared note-taking initiative breaks UC Policy 102.23 which expressly forbids students from recording lectures or discussions and from distributing or selling lecture notes and all other course materials without the prior written permission of the instructor,” Morales said in an email.</p>\n<p>Morales said the initiative seemed a lot like <em>studysoup.com</em> and other online initiatives which sell lecture notes to students.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line for me is that students who use them don’t do as well as students who don’t use them,” Morales said. “It’s important to realize that the process of taking notes during lectures is as important as the notes themselves. … So I think that this initiative encourages students not to take their own notes.”</p>\n<p>According to Khazaieli however, the research A.S. is doing is legal and unlike other online note-sharing programs Morales mentioned.</p>\n<p>“I think some people are equating what we are doing with other services that get students to upload lecture slides, content and notes, which they sell to other people to make money,” Khazaieli said. “This is not what is being done at all.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said the note-taking program would only allow access codes within the course to access the document if the program is introduced as an option for lecture attendees.“In order to access the Google Doc you need to get the unique link that we would pass out as you’re walking into class, so it ensures you have to be in class to first access the Google Doc, and then it’s taken down afterwards,” Khazaieli said. “It would also be moderated, so anybody who is not actively participating will be kicked off. So it’s not like you can access it and not take notes.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli also said the note-taking program’s collaborative nature is not breaking UC policy because it will give all students an equal opportunity to contribute to the Google Doc.</p>\n<p>“We would not be taking lecture content and lecture slides,” Khazaieli said. “Its student’s interpretations and what they’ve heard. The only difference between this and taking paper notes is that this is online.”</p>\n<p>According to Khazaieli, the A.S. Office of the Controller is in the process of finding the best way to implement the program to make it as easily accessible and function as possible.</p>\n<p>“It’s been about doing more controlled research tests to figure out how to tune the cogs and the wheels so that when the final product comes out it’s something that everybody loves and can use effectively,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Brian Lee said he would be open to any type of effort by A.S. to make information gathering in classrooms more collaborative, but said he would not use the technology himself.</p>\n<p>“I think something like this would be useful for studying because other people could clarify ideas from lecture,” Lee said. “I don’t think I would use it because I feel like I get a better understanding of material by putting it in my own words.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to the Inter-Fraternity Council President Carl Provenzano, he remains optimistic about the future of the Greek community despite this past year’s mishaps. <em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Phi Sigma Kappa National Fraternity revoked UCSB fraternity Phi Sigma Kappa’s charter on Tuesday, and the fraternity will now be in consultation with the Office of Student Life.</p>\n<p>According to a memo released to Greek organizations across campus, the fraternity of 110 members was shut down in order to preserve campus safety in light of allegedly risky new member practices. Phi Sigma Kappa was placed on interim university suspension and was under investigation in late January due to alleged violations of university policy and conduct deemed inconsistent with the fraternity’s founding principles. The fraternity is the second Greek life organization to lose its charter campus since the academic year began, <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/beta-theta-pi-suspended-after-alcohol-incident/comment-page-1/\">with Beta Theta Pi losing its charter in December</a>.</p>\n<p>Inter-fraternity Council President Carl Provenzano said the closure of the chapter was an agreement between the university, alumni and the national organization.</p>\n<p>“The school follows the judgment of the national organization and no longer recognizes them on our campus,” Provenzano said in an email. “The investigation is over and the chapter has officially closed down.”</p>\n<p>According to Provenzano, while he believes members of the fraternity are constructive members of the community, the national chapter is concerned with the chapter’s multiple policy violations.</p>\n<p>“The men in Phi Sigma Kappa are a phenomenal group of guys,” Provenzano said in an email. “They are leaders on campus and in the community. Many of them are and will remain close friends of mine. Their national organization revoked their charter because they felt the local chapter was violating risk management policies and UCSB policy.”</p>\n<p>In a release sent out by Director of Fraternities and Sororities at the Office of Student Life Kristin Van Ramshorst, Phi Sigma Kappa has been revoked for participating in activities harmful to students as well as to new members of the fraternity.</p>\n<p>“Due to unsafe new member education practices and perpetuation of an unsafe environment for UCSB community members, the International Fraternity has deemed closure necessary to ensure the health and safety of their active and new members,” the release stated.</p>\n<p>Provenzano said he remains optimistic for the future of the Greek community despite several undesirable incidents this past year.</p>\n<p>“It has been a tough year for Greeks, but we are not going anywhere on this campus and wish to move in a more positive and upward direction in the coming years,” Provenzano said in an email.</p>\n<p>President of the Signet Housing Corporation Daryl Lu, who owns the property that formerly existed as the Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity house, said the chapter has been around for nearly five decades and has contributed positively to the campus community in the past.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB Phi Sig chapter has been a positive member of the campus community, providing leadership in student government, the Interfraternity Council, and other campus organizations,” Lu said in an email. “The reputation that we earned and valued has been seriously damaged by the failure of the chapter to abide by our principles.”</p>\n<p>According to Lu, while actions taken to remove Sigma Kappa’s charter were necessary, he hopes other Greek organizations will not be affected by Phi Sigma Kappa’s suspension.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of our fraternity, we apologize for conduct by some of the undergraduates that can unfairly cast a negative impression on other Greek organizations,” Lu said. “We know full well that fraternities and sororities, when operated consistent with their principles, play a highly constructive role in enriching the lives of their members.”</p>\n<p>Members of the fraternity refused to provide comment for this article.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-61360\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Psychologist and author Larry Decker talked about his new book and PTSD in American society in a Wednesday evening lecture. <em>Cameryn Brock/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara psychologist and author Larry Decker gave a lecture on his recently released book <em>The Alchemy of Combat: Transforming Trauma in Combat Veterans</em> exploring post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans at Mosher Alumni Hall on Wednesday evening.</p>\n<p>The event was organized by the university’s Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS) and the Veteran Resource Center. During the presentation, Decker discussed various topics regarding PTSD, including the historical origins of the disorder, how combat affects soldiers, the difficulties soldiers face adjusting to life after duty and various PTSD treatments. During his talk, Decker, who has experience treating veterans from every war from WWII to Afghanistan, shared stories of individuals he had met and treated.</p>\n<p>Noting that he himself was not a veteran, Decker said civilians do not fully understand the extent of the psychological challenges veterans face.</p>\n<p>“[As] civilians, we’re so stupid, we don’t understand,” Decker said. “We don’t really want to understand. Civilians for the most part don’t want to know and they don’t really care. All we want is for you guys to just keep it to yourself, get over yourself, get on with your life.”</p>\n<p>Decker also said he has encountered many young veterans from Iraq who have expressed a desire to return to military life after service due to dissatisfaction with the banality of civilian life.</p>\n<p>“Think about it: in Iraq you’re armed to the teeth, you’ve got the power of life and death, the lives of your fellow men, fellow soldiers is in your hands. What could be more important, more meaningful?” Decker said. “Then you come back here. What do you have here? It’s an enormous statement about the meaningfulness of our culture.”</p>\n<p>Army veteran, Veterans and Military Services Coordinator and overseer of the Veterans Resource Center Kevin Hagedorn said services on campus seek to provide support for student veterans who are making the transition from service to college life.</p>\n<p>“As soon as we identify student veterans who are applying to UCSB, we make contact with them and try to help and facilitate their entry into UCSB,” Hagedorn said. “To getting admitted, to enrolling in classes, getting their GI Bill benefits and setting foot on campus.”</p>\n<p>Assistant Clinical Director at CAPS Kirsten Olson said there are many outreach programs for student veterans on campus to help with issues such as stress management.</p>\n<p>“We have staff psychologists who work with veterans,” Olson said. “They are welcome in our clinic and offer individual and group counseling. I work very closely with Kevin and our Veterans Resource Center to offer workshops for things like stress management, sleep habits and transitions to college.”</p>\n<p>Hagedorn said he had difficulties connecting with traditional students on campus after transitioning from military life to college life at CSU Chico after nine years of service in the army.</p>\n<p>“A lot of veterans are what we call non-traditional students, so they aren’t in the same pipeline as a lot of our students. Most of them are transferring from community colleges or they may have done school while they were in the military,” Hagedorn said. “When they come here to UCSB, they aren’t in the same loop that most of our students are. We want to make sure they get plugged into resources like CAPS, Disability Services, tutoring and career services.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

director at the American Task Force on Palestine Ghaith al-Omari presented a lecture in Campbell Hall about U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The talk, titled “U.S. Foreign Policy and the Chaotic Middle East,” traced the history of U.S. and Middle Eastern foreign policies from the Iran war in the 1980s to modern conflicts with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a Sunni fundamentalist group controlling large portions of Northern Iraq. The speakers made points explaining how America has negatively influenced the current state of the Middle East, education in the Middle East and ways to prevent youth from joining ISIL.</p>\n<p>Ginsberg said American policy makers need to take accountability for their mistakes interfering in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“I want to see more American policy makers say that they were dead wrong,” Ginsberg said. “We’ve invested so much with [former Iraqi] Prime Minister al-Maliki. Remember President Obama’s goals, noble goals — we want to get out of Iraq. And yet we turned the keys to a prime minister that was determined to exacerbate the Sunnis, persecute Sunnis as a result of Saddam Hussein and recreate himself as a proxy puppet for the Iranian Wars.”</p>\n<p>According to Ginsberg, the U.S. may not be entirely at fault for the current status of the region but still needs to take responsibility for contributing to the disorder in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“Let’s be very clear here,” Ginsberg said. “The Middle East is a mess. It’s a jungle out there. If we don’t understand when we need to jump into the trees when the elephants are trampling through the jungle in the forest, we have no one to blame but ourselves.”</p>\n<p>Al-Omari said although the U.S. should be held liable, the lack of structure in the Middle East also took part in the rise of disorder.</p>\n<p>“First of all, it is not the U.S.’ fault that these things happen,” al-Omari said. “We have diplomats and intelligence and people on the ground. Of course they know about religion. But we don’t have structures. There’s a bankruptcy of many ideologists of the ’60s faded when Iraq turned into a dictatorship under the guise of pro-western liberals who never really tried to engage. Between Islam and the Iraq revolution, it was only natural Islam would come in and take part.”</p>\n<p>According to Ginsberg, the Obama Administration is not qualified to successfully create effective foreign policy in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“I believe foreign policy is made by people sometimes with good intentions and sometimes by people with good intentions who make mistakes,” Ginsberg said. “My biggest gripe with the Obama’s administration Middle East Policy is that there’s absolutely no one who’s been given authority in this White House who’s been in the Middle East more than two weeks of their lives.”</p>\n<p>Ginsberg said the creation of ISIL can, to a large extent, be directly attributed to the mess that was turned over to former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.</p>\n<p>“This is not the right guy to leave in front of the storm. In some respects, and I don’t enjoy saying this, could there have been an alternative, that could side step the horrible war that is claiming so many lives in such barbaric ways,” Ginsberg said. “We’ve made our share of mistakes by trying to abandon the region and thinking by doing so we can claim victory. We did that in Vietnam and we thought we could get away from it. We are not doing the same in Iraq.”</p>\n<p>Al-Omari said although there is an absence of complex critical thinking on education in the Middle East, innovators should still be given credit for their accomplishments in the brutal conditions they work in.</p>\n<p>“Although there’s a lack of such complex skills, you have to look at what these kids work through — chaos, murder, bloodshed,” al-Omari said. “There is a sheer idea that young Palestinians could work in the incubators in Israel and work in entrepreneurial computer skills that could turn into a huge center of technological enterprise in the Middle East.”</p>\n<p>According to Ginsberg, there is a significant need for critical thinking in Middle Eastern education.</p>\n<p>“I think, in terms of education, if you look at the education at the university level, there is a tremendous lack of critical thinking,” Ginsberg said. “There is a failure to provide critical thinking and skills for the marketplace. Ultimately education is about creating national identity. It is not only lack of educational skills but also lack of critical thinking that will greed into national identity.”</p>\n<p>Ginsberg said a straightforward way to prevent youth from joining ISIL exists, and one method to do so would be to take away their passports.</p>\n<p>“Three perfectly charming young educated women are on their way to Turkey to become, as they say, of the many virgins for ISIS,” Ginsberg said. “The type of person being recruited, what is driving the FBI, CIA and homeland security … there is no one way to prevent this. Parents have to ask themselves — what are their kids watching and do they have a passport? If the kids are watching bad stuff, the first thing they should do is take away their passport.”</p>\n<p>The type of kids who are most vulnerable to being recruited for ISIL are often misfits who are looking for a new adventure in life, according to Ginsberg.</p>\n<p>“They are looking for adventure, the one thing that attracts them is that they think ISIS is winning,” Ginsberg said. “They think they’ll reach a new homeland and set aside barbarity. The recruitment videos they sent out look like they’re at Disneyland!”</p>\n<p>According to al-Omari, the best way to prevent youth from joining ISIL is to try to understand and reach out to them before they are most vulnerable to join.</p>\n<p>“Once they’ve got on a plane, it’s too late,” al-Omari said. “The only thing you can do is arrest them. It’s too far out of our control. What we’re seeing right now is an attempt to start partnerships targeting communities that are the most vulnerable for being recruited and to try and understand those community members. We need to hit it before it gets to that point.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Alex Nguyen said the talk presented him with a new perspective of American foreign policy and American interests in the Middle East, and gave a clearer description of the occurrences in the Middle East and how they affect the U.S.</p>\n<p>“I had never been exposed to something like that on that kind of level in foreign affairs in that kind of detail,” Nguyen said. “It helps frame it a lot better at where the U.S. is at. You see interviews and you see press conferences on this kind of stuff all time and it always seems like it’s thrown around, but this is very condensed and helped me understand it a lot better.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said the event and others similar in nature have allowed him to apply subjects learned in his classes in order to try and solve modern conflicts.</p>\n<p>“Studying political science, you learn these theories of how people and countries work with another, and you put it in the form of what people are trying to see,” Nguyen said. “I think it’s a very healthy thing. We as college students are the minds of the future, and it’s great we’re having these events. I hope we have more.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-61354\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A panel of presenters talked about eating disorders, including the complexities, warning signs, strategies and where to find help.<em> Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Active Minds student organization hosted a panel discussion for National Eating Disorder Awareness week on Wednesday at the Loma Pelona Center with six panelists from the Hosford Counseling and Psychological Services Clinic, the Isla Vista Food Co-op, Student Health and the Department of Counseling, Clinical and School Psychology (CCSP).</p>\n<p>The panelists discussed how to recognize the complexities of eating disorders, warning signs and coping strategies, as well as resources available on campus for those suffering from eating disorders. Throughout the event, Active Minds aimed to encourage discussion on the changing climate of the conversation on eating disorders and how to decrease the stigma surrounding the issue.</p>\n<p>Health and Wellness advisor Joanna Hill said because eating disorders are unique from many other addictions, they can be difficult to treat.</p>\n<p>“Eating disorders are different than other addictions, like alcohol or drugs because you have to eat every day,” Hill said. “CAPS [Counseling &amp; Psychological Services] is a good starting place. With eating disorders, the ideal trifecta is a registered dietician, a medical doctor and counseling or a therapist, and so if you go into any one of those areas they can help connect you into the rest of the resources.”</p>\n<p>Hosford Counseling and Psychological Services Clinic eating disorder specialist Lana Smith Hale said eating disorders are a coping mechanism that are usually linked to deeper issues.</p>\n<p>“Finding what that is for each person is part of what the experience of like working on your issues,” Smith Hale said. “The deeper issues might be anxiety, depression, obsessive thoughts, trauma, low self-esteem, family issues – it can vary. Eating disorders aren’t about the food, it’s usually about something deeper.”</p>\n<p>Smith Hale said people suffering from eating disorders should be encouraged to reach out for support and educated on how to connect with resources.</p>\n<p>“For somebody who has an eating disorder, to really take that step is such an act of strength to reach out for support,” Smith Hale said. “If that means calling a friend, getting involved with a new club, going to student health, going to CAPS, but beginning to take that step forward is so important in getting help.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds co-founder and fourth-year psychology major Lilia Goldenberg said she is passionate about mental health because herself and her family members have dealt with mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that runs in my family,” Goldenberg said. “It’s something that I’ve had so many friends talk to about. It’s prevalent in my life. Something I’ve always noticed is that a lot of people don’t talk about it in open spaces and it comes out in ways that aren’t necessarily healthy ways it may come out.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds co-founder and fourth-year communication and psychology double-major Carly Chianese said she feels strongly about eliminating the stigma surrounding eating disorders.</p>\n<p>“I just think it’s very important to start the conversation about mental health and that is what this club stands for,” Chianese said. “Just that it can be such a cathartic experience even if you’re not suffering yourself to be able to alleviate some of those feelings … and to educate our campus because the more people know, the less people are going to stigmatize.”</p>\n<p>According to Goldenberg, it is important that university campuses provide a variety of resources for individuals struggling with eating disorders.</p>\n<p>“It creates a space where people can talk about things. Instead of just talking to your friends about it, which isn’t always the most comfortable space to, they can come here and be with likeminded people,” Goldenberg said. “It’s difficult to reach communities that don’t want to be reached. So we’re trying to get people whose ears haven’t already heard the story.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Co-op manager Melissa Cohen said the Co-op can help individuals who are suffering with eating disorders by helping “to create community through food.”</p>\n<p>“Our store has become what it was meant to be, which is a hub for education, outreach, tours, nutrition education,” Cohen said. “It’s not really about doing all your shopping at the Co-op, it’s about knowing there’s a place in the community that brings together people, community and food into one place to create a really fun shopping experience. Our mission is not selling groceries, our mission is creating access to healthy food in the most affordable way possible.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said the Co-op can help everyone, including those with eating disorders, to get access to healthy food and learn about nutrition.</p>\n<p>“When I was a student the Co-op wasn’t that big of a part of my life, but as I became more invested in food … I saw how the Co-op should be more of a resource for students,” Cohen said. “We’re helping to make it more inclusive, open to everyone, more affordable. It’s less about serving one particular part of our community, more about being open to everyone. Access to healthy food should not be a privilege. It’s a right.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major Gena Sherman said the event opened the public’s eyes to resources available on campus for individuals with eating disorders.</p>\n<p>“I really liked the overall vibe of support that there was,” Sherman said. “I felt like everyone was here for the right reasons.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed Goldenberg’ s quotes to having prior personal experience with eating disorders. Her quote actually pertained to experience with mental health disorders in general, not eating disorders specifically.

Senate members listen intently as their fellow students present issues to be discussed. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night at the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss resolutions regarding the support of curricular changes in general education, senators’ workload, developments in the i&gt;Clicker rental program, recent grants from the Finance and Business Committee and the development of an A.S. lobbying group.</p>\n<p>The meeting included a debate regarding whether an additional gender and sexuality course should be required for graduation. A.S. Controller and fourth-year electrical engineering major Amir Khazaieli updated the senate on the i&gt;Clicker rental program and continuing issues as the program prepares to be launched. Finance and Business Committee Chair and fourth-year communication major Jimmy Villarreal outlined funding the committee has allotted to student groups this year.</p>\n<p>Senator and fourth-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez informed the senate of developments in Assembly member Das Williams’ Isla Vista self-governance bill AB 3, introduced in the state assembly to make I.V. a Community Services District (CSD). Lopez said the <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/\">recent issuance of a letter of concern</a> from the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is a setback in the progression of the legislation.</p>\n<p>“We passed our resolution last Wednesday and then the next day myself and a number of other senators went to the LAFCO meeting. We spoke with a lot of other students and a lot of homeowners, which is big because a lot of homeowners were not down with AB 3 at the beginning,” Lopez said. “We felt that they should not pass a letter of concern, but as it LAFCO’s way, they passed a letter of concern anyway.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said the stakeholders group compiled a list of things they would like to see in the bill language for the CSD and voted to send it to the legislature for potential amendments to keep the bill in action.</p>\n<p>“We had our discussion to find out what is palatable for everyone, sent it in, and then that will be coming back to us hopefully after we have the financial sustainability report,” Lopez said. “Then we can put together the actual bill that will be discussed on the floor.”</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini told the Senate about recent developments in her nascent student lobbying group. According to Mancini, the group plans to advocate on behalf of students politically and will be soliciting input from student groups.</p>\n<p>“We filled out a sheet with all the orgs we’re going to reach out to, and there’s quite a few of them, hopefully about 30,” Mancini said. “At our next meeting we’re going to identify our lobby targets so that’s going to be an important meeting.”</p>\n<p>Senators debated the Resolution Supporting the Establishment of a Gender and Sexuality GE Requirement, a resolution that would support additional graduation requirements regarding gender and sexuality courses.</p>\n<p>Lopez said he supports the resolution because it brings wider attention to less recognized courses.“There are classes that already cover these subject matters,” Lopez said. “[We should] just give them more recognition and … get majors that don’t usually deal with these sort of courses the opportunity to. The UC is something that should have more of a holistic education.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he supported the resolution but doubted the level of student support for the idea of advocacy for extra GE courses.</p>\n<p>“I like this resolution. I do want to point that not every student is cool with extra duties,” Villarreal said. “Since they come to school and want to get out of here and get a job and [are] not necessarily going to support extra GEs.”</p>\n<p>Senator and third-year political science and global studies major Kevin Koo said he supported the resolution and that the university’s progressive academic policies is part of his reason for doing so.</p>\n<p>“Universities are meant to grow and that’s the whole point of this,” Koo said. “It stands as a very good example of the generation that we’re in and that this is more and more a growing issue and that’s why I’m personally in favor of it.”</p>\n<p>Koo responded to Villarreal’s concerns about the lack of student support saying students would agree to the take the GE courses if they are presented as simply a regular part of the GE curriculum.</p>\n<p>“If they come in from the start knowing this is a GE, then everyone will just think that’s normal and it’s not like ‘Oh I have to do more work,’” Koo said. “It’s just gonna be ‘Oh yeah this is just part of the GE package.’”</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year student Haywood Hunter said he personally supports the resolution, but voted against it citing that his position is to be representative of all students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great idea, I would vote for it, but I represent a lot of students who would look at this as an attempt to increase units,” Hunter said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau gave a brief summary of an average senator’s workload to address her perception that the student public is not aware of how much work senators do.</p>\n<p>“I’m really concerned that people don’t know what you all do. So I had [Government Affairs advisor] Cory [Graves] help me put together a spreadsheet detailing out how many hours an average senator actually spends doing senate work,” Lau said. “This does not include any time you spent meeting with administrators, any time you spent going to local meetings, or group projects that you all have done.”</p>\n<p>According to Lau, senators also spend a lot of time reading emails, preparing for meetings and reviewing previous meetings’ minutes.</p>\n<p>“I know you all get at least 20 emails a day because I get at least 120 emails a day, but I’m sure you each get at least 20 that are relatively important that you have to read,” Lau said. “You all have to read through bills and resolutions as well as all the minutes that are sent out from all the boards and commissions in Associated Students.”</p>\n<p>Lau said it is important for senators to perform their duties on top of their schoolwork.</p>\n<p>“In total, at the very minimum, the average senator spends about 14.8 hours doing senate work,” Lau said. “So I just hope that everyone is aware of that and is aware that we are also students here.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli updated the senate on difficulties regarding the introduction of his <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/senate-considers-iclicker-rental/\">office’s i&gt;clicker rental program</a>. According to Khazaieli, technical issues with the website have prevented the online sign up process from being launched.</p>\n<p>“The i&gt;clicker program ran into a little bit of a hiccup getting the website up because we were kind of busy with the whole server side of things,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli also said that if the issues continue, the office will need a backup plan to finish its program implementation efforts.</p>\n<p>“So if we’re not able to do an online rental kind of reservation thing, we’re going to have to either come up with some plan B or maybe ask for permission to allow us to do the website,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Villarreal updated the senate on the funding the Finance and Business Committee has provided to student groups this past academic year. According to Villarreal, A.S. has granted $419,497 to 253 campus groups as of week seven of Winter quarter.</p>\n<p>“Whenever we’re questioned about how effective Associated Students is or how we help the students out, that’s how,” Villarreal said. “We provide over $400,000 worth of funding to groups so that they can put on their events, whether big or small, here or on the other side of the country, and they’re representing UCSB and making UCSB a better school.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

college students, plans to open a new sober living facility on Pasado Road in Isla Vista next year called The Haven at Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Haven at College, which has already established residences in college towns for USC, Drexel University and the University of Redlands, will house seven students in I.V. seeking to live substance-free lifestyles. The Haven at Santa Barbara would not be a university program, but Gauchos for Recovery and the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program plan to largely endorse the project.</p>\n<p>According to The Haven at College co-founder Holly Sherman, The Haven will open its doors in July and thus far has one student committed to living there. Although The Haven is currently “working on the math,” Sherman said the cost of staying at this sober living house will be roughly higher than living in an on-campus dorm.</p>\n<p>“There is an additional fee for the services we provide,” Sherman said. “It’s a little above the cost of room and board at a dorm.”</p>\n<p>Sherman said students living at The Haven will be treated with peer support programs and clinician care in order to facilitate effective recovery and ensure a healthy environment for residents.</p>\n<p>“We are a supportive group,” Sherman said. “The most practical measure is that it’s run by students — we hire students who are great role models of recovery.”<br>\nThe Haven at College co-founder Sharon Weber said The Haven at Santa Barbara was established through connections made with the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program after working with the UC Office of the President in the fall.</p>\n<p>“We had been in dialogue with the UC system and it was through that exposure that we met some of the people involved in the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program at UCSB,” Weber said. “They were the ones that invited us to come up and engage in some conversations.”</p>\n<p>According to Alcohol &amp; Drug Program director Jackie Kurta, she first heard of The Haven at College when she picked up educational literature about the program at a conference in the fall. Kurta said establishing a sober living facility in I.V. seemed like “good timing,” given the difficult past year and changing attitude of I.V. towards safety and health.</p>\n<p>“It felt to me like this would be a wonderful opportunity for us here in Isla Vista,” Kurta said. “We contacted them and they were very enthusiastic, and they really were very interested in checking out the possibilities here.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said she favors the recovery program administered at The Haven at College because it is specifically catered toward college students seeking to abstain from drug and alcohol use.</p>\n<p>“Their program is just such an excellent one,” Kurta said. “It really takes into consideration the specific needs of students in a college setting, as opposed to another traditional sober living facility which serves a kind of broad spectrum of ages and lifestyles.”</p>\n<p>According to Weber, The Haven at Santa Barbara will act as a supportive body to aid students seeking to refrain from substance abuse rather than as a “policing body.”</p>\n<p>“We don’t have anything against drugs and alcohol; we believe they have their place in the college life,” Weber said. “But if you have a problem with them and they’re kicking your ass, then you’re welcome to come to The Haven at Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>UCLA alumnus Danny Buchan said he has been living at The Haven at USC for two years since seeking recovery from his drug addiction and is now four years clean.</p>\n<p>“If I didn’t do something, I would have died, or much less be able to go to school or live a constructive life, so I went to treatment and I got into recovery,” Buchan said. “Now that I’ve gone into recovery, I can enjoy life at the moment and be more connected to the world and people around me.”</p>\n<p>Buchan said he works as The Haven at USC house manager, where he administers recovery practices such as weekly 12-step programs, frequent breathalyzing, random urine tests and a temporary curfew.</p>\n<p>“There are accountability measures that we have just to assure the safety of The Haven and to make sure that everyone is staying sober and that everyone’s on the right track,” Buchan said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This article has been updated accordingly.]</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate has lifted a <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/academic-senate-approves-suspension-of-admissions-to-ccs-literature-major/\">2014 admissions freeze</a> placed on the College of Creative Studies (CCS) Literature program, effective immediately and opening to students admitted for Fall 2016.</p>\n<p>Admission to the program was suspended on a temporary basis last year by the Undergraduate Council over concerns regarding program leadership, lack of adequate involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty and an underdeveloped relationship with other campus departments.  The Senate approved the decision to lift the freeze by the Undergraduate Council at a meeting last week on Feb. 12.  The suspension of admissions did not affect the degree trajectories of students already enrolled in the program.</p>\n<p>According to Undergraduate Council Executive Director Deborah Karoff, admission to the program was reinstated after the concerns leading to its suspension were addressed and resolved with efforts by multiple campus departments and faculty members.</p>\n<p>“The College of Creative Studies and several other departments on campus worked together to strengthen the involvement of Senate faculty in the program,” Karoff said.</p>\n<p>According to Karoff, it is a norm at the university that Senate-affiliated faculty participate in major programs of all the departments on campus. Karoff also said a number of individual Senate faculty and campus departments have made commitments to support the program in the future in a way sufficient enough to convince the Undergraduate Council to lift the freeze.</p>\n<p>Dean of CCS and professor of paleobiology Bruce Tiffney said the program suffered from lack of a “coherent curriculum” in place to develop foundational skills for literature students.</p>\n<p>“The program did not have a coherent curriculum put together that was allowing students to both clearly develop in their skills as both students of literature and of writing,” Tiffney said. “[The program] was not set up in a manner that would ensure that they would get out and be taking a range of courses outside and encountering these really wonderful faculty the campus has.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney said the decline of Senate-affiliated faculty over the years took place as part of a historical process of faculty engagement issues. He also mentioned that all other programs in CCS except literature have at least one Senate lecturer in their roster, which are faculty members in CCS and its equivalent academic department in the College of Letters and Science. According to Tiffney, a search is underway for a candidate to hold that dual position.</p>\n<p>“That individual will then be a core leader in the program … who has feet in both Letters and Science and CCS,” Tiffney said. “Now that this has been lifted, the is primary focus is to go and … can run a search.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney also said the CCS literature program historically has had a strong creative writing background in its instruction, but that other aspects of literary study were less prominent in the program. According to Tiffney, the program’s name may be changed to CCS Writing and Literature to reflect the greater breadth that comes with more faculty engagement as well as curricular changes. The curricular changes will reflect the increase of involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty as well as structural changes associated with the program’s foundational material.</p>\n<p>“In the past we did not have a set of courses that in essence built from the bottom up and developed a sense of knowledge from the campus of resources of expected areas of expertise,” Tiffney said. “What we are doing here — we did not have this before — would be a sequence of courses that would develop a background in literature … creative writing and then writing studies.”</p>\n<p>CCS literature instructor Angela Holzmeister said she is pleased the program will accept admissions for the coming academic year.</p>\n<p>“My experience teaching literature courses in CCS has been a tremendously gratifying one, due, not in the least, to the impressively intelligent students I’ve had the pleasure of working with this year,” Holzmeister said in an email. “These students are not only testimony to the quality of students admitted into CCS, but they are also the product of the education they receive at CCS.”</p>\n<p>The program will still undergo certain changes as it reopens for admissions, including unapproved curricular and name changes that will be considered at a March 12 meeting of the Academic Senate.</p>\n<p>CCS literature alumnus and current Community Manager of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Tony Pierce said he was pleased with the change in fortune for the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m super relieved that the university has realized that they have a hidden flower patch in CCS Lit that should just be left alone to bloom,” Pierce said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said in a statement that he is thankful to the various faculty and administrative officials who helped oversee the program’s return.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that … Dean Bruce Tiffney and his administrative colleagues have overseen a successful proposal to revitalize CCS’s literature program,” Yang said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/","id":2850,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2849,2848,2847],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"American Indian Author, Poet Reads from Newest Book","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"American Indian author, poet and professor at Washington and Lee University Deborah A.

I remember it very clearly. It was all about how a family was all massacred where the husband survives and has more children,” Miranda said. “This is rather amusing now, but we need to keep in mind that this is all coming from childhood trauma that deals with familial matters.”</p>\n<p>According to Miranda, humor is important to her teaching style because she believes that “Washington is paying her to make other people’s lives miserable,” and it allows her students to be successful in the future.</p>\n<p>“Humor is important from the start. I bring guest professionals in my class that students will not expect, and I feel like I must make people feel intimidated and bring different perspectives by making other people miserable,” Miranda said. “Washington pays me to make people feel miserable.

Clinic to further discuss potential services and funding that a Community Services District (CSD) would entail.</p>\n<p>Students, I.V. residents, university administrators and members of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors have been meeting weekly for the past several months to discuss Williams’s I.V. self-governance bill AB 3, which was introduced in December to establish I.V. as a CSD which can potentially levy taxes in order to provide residents certain infrastructure and services. Currently, the group is discussing the details of a potential I.V. CSD to fund graffiti removal, bluff fencing and other services.</p>\n<p>According to Esther Aguilera, Representative for Santa Barbara County Third District Doreen Farr, the county does not provide adequate funding for graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have money for graffiti abatement so every year what I do is go to UCSB for $2,000, go to the county for $2,000 and the property owners for $2,500,” Aguilera said. “This year the I.V. Property Association did not give us $2,500 so I had to find somewhere that amount. Every year we have to go through this process. The county is not set up to do graffiti abatement.”</p>\n<p>Aguilera said while the county does partially fund graffiti abatement services for I.V., funding is not guaranteed in the future.</p>\n<p>“You have someone in the third district who actively is asking for money and that’s how graffiti is being taken care of, but when the third district supervisor is no longer there, it’s going to be a problem,” Aguilera said.</p>\n<p>According to second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, the county does not have adequate funding mechanisms in place to provide much needed fencing for I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it kind of shows some of the pitfalls of the [county] services,” Minoiefar said. “In the part that says ‘sexual assaults and riots,’ maybe mention cliff falls and things like that. … We can’t even keep people from falling from the cliffs.”</p>\n<p>Aguilera also said the addition of bluff-side fencing around parks on Del Playa Drive should be included into the jurisdiction of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“What about adding fence maintenance as one of the powers? And then you would have control of that fence,” Aguilera said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61298\" style=\"width: 337px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61298\" data-attachment-id=\"61298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/das-williams_brendan-mansfield-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"T J Carmody\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424816365\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61298\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2-683x1024.jpg?resize=327%2C491\" alt=\"(Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus)\" width=\"327\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?w=1067&amp;ssl=1 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus)</p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould said the county should remain responsible for funding maintenance of the fences.</p>\n<p>“You don’t want to take that on,” Gould said. “IVRPD owns some of the parks. The county owns the rest of them and they’re responsible for paying for that. There’s no reason we should be absorbing that.”</p>\n<p>According to community organizer with Williams’ office Darcel Elliott, the ideas stakeholders brainstormed at the meeting will be used to flesh out the specifics of AB 3 in the near future.</p>\n<p>“This is just placeholder language to get into committee right now,” Elliott said. “This isn’t the big enchilada. This would never pass out of committee because there is no funding mechanism to provide all these services. This is so that we can keep the bill alive.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major and IVRPD board member Paola De La Cruz said she is concerned about the proposed utility users tax, which would charge I.V. residents a percentage of their utility bills to fund services and could affect small households.</p>\n<p>“I live with one roommate. There’s only two of us but there is no gas; we only pay electricity,” De La Cruz said. “Our bill is a high amount, usually about $150 for electricity. The amount of money we would be paying compared to another house with five students is going to be higher.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the goal of the proposed utility user tax is to create a tax that is fairly distributed.</p>\n<p>“The reason we are having this discussion is to put the burden most fairly on the most amount of people,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Board member Pegeen Soutar said a per-bedroom tax is preferable to a utility users tax to fairly divide the payment of local taxes.</p>\n<p>“Parks and Rec has a bedroom tax and that’s the majority of our funding, and it’s $94 a year, and that’s down by a two-thirds vote by taxpayers in the community,” Soutar said. “The landowners pay it, but in all reality that’s passed on by rent. I look at that as a very equitable way to place a tax.”</p>\n<p>According to De La Cruz, the stakeholders’ town hall meeting held last Saturday in Anisq’oyo’ Park was successful in including more students in the process of discussing self-governance.</p>\n<p>“I loved having it at the park,” De La Cruz said. “I saw some people I think were students just walking by and sitting out on the small hill just listening to conversations that were happening. I wish we would have had time for actual discussion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61313\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61313\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/","id":4740,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4739,4738,4737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Professor Talks About Muslims in the US","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Yale University Professor of American and Religious Studies Zareena Grewal held a discussion about the cultural role of Muslim Americans in the U.S., American media portrayal of Islam and current deba...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61300\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61300\" data-attachment-id=\"61300\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/professor-talks-about-muslims-in-the-us/zareena-grewal-speaks-to-a-full-crowd-at-the-mcc/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=1600%2C1229&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1229\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424773198\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"170\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Reform of Islam/Muslims\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=250%2C192&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=888%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61300\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-1024x787.jpg?resize=600%2C461\" alt=\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.

Grewal’s in-depth research about American Muslims discusses whether Islam can be seen as an American religion in the same way that other religions are accepted.</p>\n<p>According to Grewal, there is a common sentiment in the U.S. that assumes Islam contradicts widely-held American values.</p>\n<p>“There is something specific about Islam that for many people makes [them] understand it as kind of the exact antithesis of American values,” Grewal said.</p>\n<p>Quoting Malcolm X’s speech “The Ballot or the Bullet,” Grewal delineated the difference between legal citizenship and social citizenship to convey that American Muslims are still dealing with issues that existed in the 1960’s.</p>\n<p>“I hope what you’ll see when you hear this quote is how much it is still relevant today, the kinds of things he is posing,” Grewal said. “He says … ‘Being here in America doesn’t make you an American. Being born here in America doesn’t make you an American. Why if birth made you an American, you wouldn’t need any legislation; you wouldn’t need any amendments to the Constitution.’”</p>\n<p>According to Grewal, American media has created an obstacle for American Muslims by primarily focusing on of terrorism when any discussion on Islam arises. According to Grewal, this has dramatically changed the way in which American Muslims speak to one another regarding the debate on the reform of Islam.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61301\" style=\"width: 257px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61301\" data-attachment-id=\"61301\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/professor-talks-about-muslims-in-the-us/zareena-grewal-speaks-to-a-full-crowd-at-the-mcc-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.2\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424774127\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Reform of Islam/Muslims\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61301\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=247%2C164\" alt=\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.

policies for deadlines for the March 2 filing of 2015–16 financial aid applications.</p>\n<p>The policy shift comes as part of an effort by the financial aid office to ensure equitable distribution of university funding to students who file their applications on time and to increase the amount of students who file in a timely manner. The shift applies to students applying for university funding using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and CA DREAM Act funding, due March 2. The restrictions on FAFSA filing does not apply to certain funding sources such as Federal Pell grants and scholarships, and is strictly limited to institutional financial aid provided by the university.</p>\n<p>Students who miss the filing date are allowed to make an appeal via the existing appeals process for “on-time status,” which would allow them to be considered for full university funding despite missing the deadline. Additionally, the financial aid office will also be strictly enforcing a June 15 deadline to submit financial aid related documents, such as W-2 tax forms.</p>\n<p>Financial aid office director Mike Miller said while the university has always had priority deadlines for students, they have not been strictly enforced until now.</p>\n<p>“In the past we’ve created a culture of kind of procrastination and there weren’t any penalties for students who didn’t meet the deadlines,” Miller said. “Over the years it’s become a significant issue workload-wise, but also in terms of funding availability.”</p>\n<p>Miller also said stricter deadlines should ensure students do not miss out on funding because university funding is limited and there is significant possibility for the funding to simply run out in part because of an increase in student need for financial aid.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, when our university grant funds run out, which has been happening over the last couple of years because we have more needy students on campus … even if somebody submits an appeal for on time status, if we don’t have the funding then we can’t fund them,” Miller said, “So it’s really important that students get their applications in on time.”</p>\n<p>Miller said while appeals are still an option for late filers, appeals will be granted on a case by case basis for extreme circumstances.</p>\n<p>“We’ll take a look at all the appeals that we get and if there are extreme circumstances then we’ll look at those on a case by case basis,” Miller said. “But if a student misses the deadline and simply sends us an appeal that says that they weren’t aware that they needed verification documents because they didn’t read their email, then those are situations that will likely be denied moving forward.”</p>\n<p>According to the financial aid office, insufficient circumstances do not include lack of knowledge of published deadlines, limited means of communication or email access, events occurring after the deadline, failure to complete the FAFSA based on tax filing status if estimated information is available, a parent’s refusal to provide information on the FAFSA or insufficient financial aid as a result of missing priority deadlines.</p>\n<p>Miller said extenuating circumstances could include, but are not limited to, getting ill, sustaining an injury or otherwise some event that prevents them from collecting the necessary documents. Miller urged students to check their university email account and check the financial aid website as a way to keep up to date on financial aid policies.</p>\n<p>The financial aid office has roughly $60 to $63 million dollars to distribute as well as 17,000 financial aid applicants annually, with average award amounts clocking in at around $6,300 per student. According to Miller, around 2,000 students or 10 percent of filers file their applications after the deadline, typically in September when students enroll for Fall and resume paying tuition.</p>\n<p>“A lot students just won’t complete that [application] until right before they need financial aid,” Miller said, “So there’s a huge delay and in some cases we’ll ask for documentation in March and April and sometimes they won’t turn it in until September and that’s a long time to be sitting on request for documentation especially when it comes to funding your education.”</p>\n<p>However, according to former announcements by the financial aid office, aid awards are distributed beginning in July.</p>\n<p>According to first-year global studies major Mayela Morales, other options aside from strict deadlines exist, including moving existing FAFSA workshops to earlier in the quarter to avoid conflicts with midterms and end-of-quarter academic pressures.</p>\n<p>“I feel like there is other options besides just completely cutting off the flexibility with the deadline,” Morales said. “I see their point of view but there’s other options, because by enforcing that March 2nd deadline you are completely cutting off someone’s financial aid.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major, Johanna, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she was not worried about the stricter policy affecting her because precise tax information can still be provided later as long as estimates are submitted with the application on time.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s an important deadline that has to be met, and I’ve never worried about missing the deadline so I don’t feel like the stricter policy affects me directly,” Johanna said in an email.</p>\n<p>Miller said the move to tighten restrictions is a campus decision without any push from the state or federal government, while most other campuses in the UC system enforce strict adherence to filing deadlines.</p>\n<p>“We would have several thousand students who just didn’t do anything for themselves until they come back in the fall,” Miller said. “So we would get a huge rush of financial aid applications in August and September and that really created kind of a log jam for us especially when the fee deadline was coming up.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, looser enforcement has been the norm because it allows for the most flexibility for students to receive money, but an increase in the number of “needy students” has put additional pressure on the office to distribute funding effectively. While part of the $63 million the office annually distributes is for usually set aside for late filers, having as many students as possible apply on time allows the office to better estimate how much funding will need to be distributed all students.</p>\n<p>“Say for example we have 95 percent of our students applying on time; that just gives us a much better baseline to begin the planning,” Miller said. “Just having a better idea of how many applicants we’re going to have on an annual basis, we can really budget out what we’re going to spend a lot more accurately.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61278\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61278\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/","id":2879,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2878,2877,2876],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":125,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
