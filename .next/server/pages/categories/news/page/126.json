President and Morse for A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) under the FTP platform, and both will make an official announcement at the Declaration of Candidacy meeting on March 5. The idea for FTP, which will be the first new party formed since 2010, came from a campus club Morse began in Fall 2013 while a student at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC).</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, FTP aims to preserve the freedoms of individual students.</p>\n<p>“We’re about preserving the basic rights of the students, allowing people who are doing their own thing, minding their own business, to live life,” Garshfield said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said a major component of the FTP platform will be trimming down the A.S. budget to focus on essential services, stating that the library is an example of misaligned budgetary priorities.</p>\n<p>“It’s going through this three-year renovation and that’s going to be going on almost until I graduate,” Garshfield said. “Before either using taxpayer dollars or student funds on these grand projects, we should be focusing on preserving the rights of the students, and that’s what we’re about.”</p>\n<p>Morse said A.S. should not impose funds through lock-in fees, especially considering the low election turnout during fee initiative elections. According to him, FTP will instead give students the option to pay for activities and services separately.</p>\n<p>“You’re voting with your dollar at that point,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Official People’s Party (OPP) Chair and fourth-year political science major Elijah Ettenger said in a statement that eliminating lock-in fees is not the solution to increase fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<p>“We feel the solution is instead to have a more strict process for the enactment of new lock-in fees so that only the most critical are approved,” Ettenger said.</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, one of FTP’s main concerns is “police occupation” in Isla Vista, and he criticized OPP for not addressing this alleged issue.</p>\n<p>“We’re very concerned about the police occupation,” Garshfield said. “The fact that our only elected representatives haven’t been dealing with it is something we definitely feel needs to be corrected.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said while he believes FTP’s goal to address police behavior will be “fairly noncontroversial” among students, the party’s views on how to address the issue may face opposition.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the students are fed up with the police presence,” Garshfield said. “So that at least is something a lot of students will get behind. What I think might be controversial is that we’re willing to choose freedom over safety … There are some people who believe that without the increased police presence, we are not going to be able to maintain order.”</p>\n<p>Morse said A.S. should view police relations through a framework of “community-based solutions.”</p>\n<p>“I think that there are definitely ways that we can self-regulate,” Morse said, “We don’t need this sort of martial law.”</p>\n<p>According to Ettenger however, OPP has already taken steps toward improving community and police relations.</p>\n<p>“In order to achieve this we must first bring everyone to the table,” Ettenger stated. “OPP has already begun this process by organizing programs such as Pizza with Police and Coffee with the Cops.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Foot Patrol Lieutenant Robert Plastino said he agrees that there needs to be increased efforts made to improve police relations with the student community.</p>\n<p>“Positions like a Community Resource Deputy are sorely needed in Isla Vista, yet budget and staffing issues prevent such outreach,” Plastino said in an email.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said the process he underwent to register FTP as an official party was unnecessarily complicated and could potentially discourage other student political participation.</p>\n<p>“There’s also this very complex set of rules and regulations, and I think a lot of it is designed to stop ordinary students from getting involved,” Garshfield said. “That’s something that’s concerning to me and I’d like to see the elections code made … a little simpler for students to get involved with.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science, black studies major and former Democratic Process (DP) party candidate Mohsin Mirza said he agrees the process involves many barriers. According to him, the DP party has not announced any candidates for the upcoming election.</p>\n<p>“The process is difficult, but more than just rules and regulations,” Mirza said. “If you don’t have the money, if you don’t have the time, if you’re a working-class student — it’s very difficult to be in those positions.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair and second-year political science major Fiona Hayman however said starting a political party is a very accessible process for students.</p>\n<p>“Anyone can start their own party if they fill out the necessary form and appoint a party liaison, who will be the point of communication between the party and the Elections Committee,” Hayman said. “I see this as beneficial for the UCSB community, as the accessibility of the processes of forming a party and running for office is essential to the efficacy of democracy.</p>\n<p>Morse said he and Garshfield decided to register a party for this spring’s election in part to ensure there is a party to compete against OPP.</p>\n<p>“It seems like the OPP party is the only one that is running, so we thought that it was important just to have a competition of different ideas,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he is worried OPP is gaining complete control of the campus’ political conversations.</p>\n<p>“Over time, I’m worried that it will become more and more of a political machine that simply turns out candidates for the sake of winning,” Garshfield said. “Someone needs to challenge the status quo, and we were the ones to stand up and do it.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, multi-sided political party competition is important to represent the variety of student voices that exist on campus.</p>\n<p>“I believe we need to have multiple parties,” Mirza said. “The fact that there’s just two parties I think is a failure, because I think students think in more than two different ways.”</p>\n<p>But Ettenger said OPP is committed to representing each and every student on campus.</p>\n<p>“Every year our party brings together a diversified group of students that provide a consistent influx of new and innovative ideas to best represent all students,” Ettenger said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to Morse, FTP has gathered support and would like to run more candidates in the upcoming A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“We’ve found some other people who are interested in running with us,” Morse said. “Generally, we have gained a lot of support.”</p>\n<p>Morse said while FTP’s conservative ideas may face challenges, he hopes the party will be seen as a vehicle for representing common student interests.</p>\n<p>“The Free Thinking Patriots is not about representing one party as a whole,” Morse said. “Its specific mandate is to rise above that and come up with common ground solutions.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, the rising cost of education makes collective funding for student groups vital in order to ensure student empowerment and diversity.</p>\n<p>“At a time when education is so expensive, we need well-funded organizations advocating for us,” Mirza said. “The idea of having students pay for things themselves, out of pocket, undermines the idea that we are stronger when we act together and pull all our resources together.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he runs the A.S. Lobby Corps, which uses A.S. funding to take students to Sacramento to meet with California legislators and lobby on student-related issue like affordability of education. Mirza said he thus feels A.S. funding for particular student activities is important.</p>\n<p>“That money is used for very important things that help students,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Mirza also said the A.S. budget could be made more efficient without having to reduce collective student funding.</p>\n<p>“Do I think that we could be doing more with the resources we have? Yes,” Mirza said. “But I think it’s absurd to say the solution is to weaken our own power by taking away our ability to fund ourselves and our projects.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, although he does not “think that it’s a secret that [he is] a conservative,” he said he hopes FTP will be seen as a vehicle for representing common student interests, not as a platform for his and Garshfield’s politics.</p>\n<p>“The Free Thinking Patriots is not about representing one party as a whole,” Morse said. “Its specific mandate is to rise above that and come up with common ground solutions.”</p>\n<p>While Garshfield called FTP an “underdog,” he said believes in its ideals and is ready to compete with OPP.</p>\n<p>“If I didn’t believe in shooting high I wouldn’t be doing this,” Garshfield said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

(Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus)</p></div>\n<p>Principal Researcher of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City Alicia Civera Cerecedo presented a lecture in HSSB on Monday night about the 2014 mass kidnapping of Ayotzinapa students in Iguala, Mexico, and giving a historical account of government corruption surrounding the incident.</p>\n<p>Titled “The Ayotzinapa Student Massacre and the Rural Teacher Training Schools in Mexico: A Historical Perspective,” the event drew around 100 attendees and covered the history of Mexico’s teacher training schools and the September disappearances of 43 students from the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teacher’s College of Ayotzinapa. Cerecedo discussed the social movement that arose in Mexico after the kidnappings, the history of teacher training schools in Mexico and baseless narratives that are being forced onto teachers’ reputations by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) government in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Sixty percent of the population in Mexico over the age of 15 are in a situation of “lack of education or of not being fully educated,” and people who reside in rural areas have an average education of 6.4 years, according to Cerecedo. She also said Mexican youth are forced to enter cities or migrate to the U.S. because of acute poverty in rural Mexico, and many face challenging economic circumstances and must resort to the drug trade to survive.</p>\n<p>“The civil society is in a state of disbelief and the judicial process day-to-day becomes more apparent that it has been impeded,” said Cerecedo.</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, drug traffickers provide health services and security when the state fails to do so; however the line between government protection and drug cartel protection is becoming increasingly blurred. Cerecedo said drug trafficking is clearly becoming more integrated into the government entity.</p>\n<p>“In the case of Iguala, it became patently clear that drug trafficking is at all levels and in all types of government,” Cerecedo said. “Municipal, state, federal — in the executive, judicial and legislative. In the army as well.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the Mexican government is using corrupt forms of control and abusing their power by projecting societal problems of illiteracy and poverty onto the teachers. Cerecedo said the Mexican media, which is strictly controlled by the PRI regime, also blames teachers for the failures of the education system.</p>\n<p>Chaos surrounding the education system makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly what caused the Ayotzinapa Student Massacre, Cerecedo said.</p>\n<p>“The disappearance of the students happens at a time when you have social conflict and increasing social violence and an economic crisis all coming together,” Cerecedo said. “And it’s at a time when teachers are putting face against PRI authority or challenging the PRI.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the PRI came into power two years ago and has since targeted all opposing political parties or ideologies with hostility.</p>\n<p>“[The PRI] identifies all political parties as a political class without ideas,” Cerecedo said, “[They] are distributing power among themselves which results in a lot of corruption.”</p>\n<p>Cerecedo ended the lecture by saying that Mexico’s political system is essentially based on a “Constitution of a political system that no longer guards the people.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor in the history department and event translator Gabriela Soto Laveaga said she hopes the story of the missing students was thought-provoking for students on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s powerful because … the students who disappeared are your age,” Laveaga said. “I think that’s really poignant. Forty-three people disappeared and were tortured because they were studying.”</p>\n<p>Laveaga said the lecture highlighted to her the vital role student activists play in implementing social change.</p>\n<p>“I think we tend to be really disconnected out here. Sometimes we forget that in most countries its students are the activists,” Laveaga said. “It’s students who are really involved with social change. And maybe Mexico is not that far — it’s our neighbor to our south. And we could be a little more aware of the power of university students in other parts of the world.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Karla Estrada said she attended the event to get a different perspective on the events that unfolded during the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to come to the event because I was aware of the massacre in Iguala and I wanted to get a first-hand account from the professor who is directly from Mexico City,” Estrada said. “She obviously has a really different perspective from professors here in the UC. A lot of my professors talk about what happened, but I felt like I just wanted to get her input.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major Kreg Zaragoza said listening to Cerecedo’s lecture first-hand perspective was akin to receiving “insider information.”<br>\n“It’s good to hear from someone who is actually from Mexico,” Zaragoza said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61306\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61306\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/","id":2883,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2882,2881,2880],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

First Friday planners were initially organizing a larger-than-average version of the event with multiple stages but ran into issues once Santa Barbara County approved noise ordinances during the first two weekends of April in order to prevent this year’s Deltopia from becoming disorderly. I.V. First Friday is coordinated by I.V. Open Lab, a project-based course offered by the university’s Interdisciplinary Humanities Center and sponsored by the I.V. Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) and the I.V. Food Co-Op. The event is hosted as a late-night alternative to what many students call the “I.V. party scene,” and is held the first Friday of every month at Perfect Park, featuring live local music, artwork, improvisation and dance performances and more.</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould, the original plan for the First Friday on April 3 was to have a number of groups and organizations co-host a block party that would have been larger than most First Fridays to date.</p>\n<p>“We were actually considering fencing off the entire end of the loop and having multiple stages with varying forms of entertainment operating simultaneously,” Gould said in an email. “Before we got very far into the planning, we realized we couldn’t proceed due to the festival ordinance that was put into place for Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Gould said the original proposal for I.V. First Friday was suggested in anticipation of the influx of people expected to come to I.V. during Deltopia weekend, which attracted an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 partygoers in last April. </p>\n<p>“We figured that there would be a lot of people in town that night,” Gould said in an email. “The University has planned a lot of things Saturday as alternatives, but there was nothing on Friday, so we thought this might take some of the burden off the Del Playa partying.”</p>\n<p>Gould said I.V. Open Lab is now exploring the possibility of having an art show in the early evening of April 3 at the I.V. Clinic building that would feature I.V.’s “hidden art community.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of resident artists in Isla Vista that people just don’t know about that have been here for years, so we thought it would be kind of fun to showcase that,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the students of I.V. Open Lab are also discussing organizing a silent movie series and a silent disco, though the plans for the First Friday to be held on April 3 are still dependent on approval from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to figure out a mellow, outdoor lounge-like event for that Friday,” Yasuda said. “We also want it to be local, so that’s why we’re showcasing the resident artists’ artwork. The visual display is quiet, the disco is quiet and then we thought about silent movies.”</p>\n<p>Second-year English major and I.V. Open Lab student Itxy Quintanilla said it was disappointing to learn the initial plans for the First Friday on April 3 could not be executed.</p>\n<p>“We are saving those plans for a future month,” Quintanilla said in an email. “We understand the reason for the implementation of these ordinances, but it has been difficult to work around them.”</p>\n<p>Quintanilla said she is hopeful the newly proposed events will be approved by Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“After throwing around several ideas and discussing the ordinances, we hope that our movie in the park proposal will meet the guidelines and provide a safe and engaging community gathering,” Quintanilla said in an email. “Hopefully our plans are approved in order to create another successful event.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said the collaboration between students, faculty, residents and local businesses is what makes First Fridays special, and she hopes the First Friday scheduled for the night of April 3 can still take place.</p>\n<p>“We want it to happen and we think it’s going to be great and attract the right kind of people,” Yasuda said. “We feel it is really important to have programming that is creative, safe and alternative, because if you have nothing, then that’s when the trouble starts.” Yasuda said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

evening to inspect light posts and light bulbs on campus in an effort to make the university safer and more light-efficient.</p>\n<p>UCPD officers, university staff, administrators, professors, students and Campus Security Officers (CSO) participated in the event with the goal of making the university a more secure environment at night. The event split participants into three groups and covered three different walking routes: behind Davidson Library; from Girvetz Hall to the Student Resource Building (SRB); near the bus loop and the RecCen. Each group was led by a UCPD officer, two university staff members and two CSOs.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fisher said safety involves “adequate lighting” on campus, and Administrative Services strives to address lighting issues every year.</p>\n<p>“It is very important for people to feel safe within the community,” Fisher said. “We have been working on new lighting projects for the past twelve years, since I have personally been here.”</p>\n<p>According to Fisher, old round light bulbs, also called “Johnny Balls,” will be replaced in every walkway with newer and stronger white lighting.</p>\n<p>“We have replaced fixtures such as Johnny Balls,” Fisher said. “Our goal is to have most of those replaced throughout the walkways. We want a whiter light everywhere and we see lighting deficiency right now, but it will be improved.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said the university is installing new lighting because the currently-placed bulbs are an outdated brand that contribute to light pollution.</p>\n<p>“The old Johnny Balls were created in the 1960s, but we are replacing the old style fixtures,” Fisher said. “These globe lights produce sky globes, and one of the goals of the campus is to change this because in an environmental perspective, it spills light into the sky for color rendition and we want light on the ground as opposed to the sky.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and UCPD Patrol Sergeant Matt Blime said bright lighting prevents crime from occurring on campus and allows students to feel more safe on campus at night.</p>\n<p>“I think proper lighting on campus is a deterrence for crime,” Blime said. “If a person is looking to commit a crime, it is less likely that they will do it in an area that is very well lit. At the same time, it gives students more of a sense of safety and security while walking on the campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Blime, serious crimes on campus have been less frequent over the past year due to student participation in safety-related events.</p>\n<p>“We want to promote safety, for everyone here,” Blime said. “We have had a reduction of serious crime in the past year. We have had a 10-20 percent decrease in crimes and it has become more popular for students to participate in these walks and create more safety because we address concerns.”</p>\n<p>Campus Senior Electrical Utility Lead Jim Morrison said a person’s facial expression is more visible under whiter light, which would expose the intentions of a potential perpetrator before a crime is committed.</p>\n<p>“We want more white light,” Morrison said. “During the summer months, they stay on for nine hours and 13 hours in the winter time. If you have a whiter light, you can see facial expressions more. Before a crime, you can see if people look ticked-off and this light makes it possible to see.”</p>\n<p>Biology graduate student graduate Emily Ellis said it is discomforting to walk to her car at night in the dark after late classes.</p>\n<p>“The animals that I study are nocturnal,” Ellis said. “I am happy to stay for experiments, but it is unnerving when it is pitch black and I am the only person on campus. I definitely walk faster and only go towards areas where it is well-lit.”</p>\n<p>Ellis said she worries about her students’ safety when they leave her class at 10 p.m. because the Life Sciences Building currently does not have sufficient lighting due to construction at Davidson Library.</p>\n<p>“It is good to see what is around you and to feel safe as if you are in your own home,” Ellis said. “I worry for them because you never know what can happen.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, administrators and police officers have demonstrated throughout the years that they are invested in ensuring student safety.</p>\n<p>“This type of event is really assuring that people care about the student concerns. It seems like the administrators and UCPD officers really care about the opinions of students. The survey that was sent out via email recently is an example of this as well.”</p>\n<p>CSO officer and fourth-year Chican@ studies major Melissa Cruz said theft is the most common crime on campus. According to her, theft occurs frequently because darkness facilitates stealing.</p>\n<p>“I have been a CSO for three years and the lights have always been important,” Cruz said, “It brightens up the campus and deters people from stealing things. Stealing is the biggest issue here at UCSB, especially stealing bikes.”</p>\n<p>Cruz said CSO flashlights can only do so much to prevent theft at night and that the new installation of lights will help significantly more in preventing crime.</p>\n<p>“If somebody looks suspicious, we only flash our lights at them,” Cruz said. “But if there are lights then it can prevent them from stealing bikes.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/","id":2873,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2872,2871,2870],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVTU Continues Tenant Rights Campaign","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) rallied support at the Pardall Center on Friday for an upcoming march to protest the eviction of six households from their homes at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road last A...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61224\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61224\" data-attachment-id=\"61224\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/ivtu-continues-tenant-rights-campaign/ivtu-rally_brendan-mansfield-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-4.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"10\",\"credit\":\"T J Carmody\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424457210\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU Rally\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-4.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61224\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-4-1024x683.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Isla Vista Tenants Union gave out food and hosted a tie-dye event last Friday as part of their continuing campaign against Majestic Management, LLC.

The tenants have hired an IVTU-sponsored lawyer with the Associated Students Legal Resource Center to pursue legal action in small claims court to obtain their benefits, with a hearing to take place on March 4 in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and linguistics major and IVTU Vice-President Alexandra Meallet said Majestic Asset Management, LLC provided insufficient support for evicted residents and thus the union hopes they can resolve the issue before the court date.</p>\n<p>“When we addressed the issue, [the company] refused to acknowledge that they had broken the ordinance,” Meallet said. “But they did try to go back on some of the evictions … by then all the families had signed new leases and new contracts so they couldn’t come back to their homes. We’re trying to fight for relocation and compensation benefits, and we will be going to court next month. We’re hoping they will agree and give these families their benefits before then.”</p>\n<p>Through Spanish-to-English translation by IVTU Outreach Director and third-year sociology major Bridgett Figueroa, evicted resident Vicenta Martinez said she faces many challenges after she was not provided the proper relocation benefits that are required by the ordinance.</p>\n<p>“I am currently living in a small unit near Dos Pueblos High School,” Martinez said. “I have to deal with transportation issues to get to work in Isla Vista. It’s difficult for me to put down money for my new unit.”</p>\n<p>Meallet said IVTU is hosting frequent events on Pardall Road in order to bring attention to the tenant rights violations committed by property owners who do not have a stake in the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to give the broader community a free bite to eat and make some free tie-dye so we get the chance to tell them about the situation that’s going on,” Meallet said. “Hopefully so they will support us, sign the petition and come to our picket next Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the legal aid IVTU has provided her and other tenants in the past year has been vital to helping rectify the eviction issues that have been occurring to many low-income tenants in I.V.</p>\n<p>“IVTU has provided lots of emotional and financial help during this time,” Martinez said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61222\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61222\" data-attachment-id=\"61222\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/ivtu-continues-tenant-rights-campaign/ivtu-rally_brendan-mansfield-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"9\",\"credit\":\"T J Carmody\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424456549\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU Rally\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61222\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61222\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>IVTU President and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov said IVTU’s aid to the community goes beyond the situation at the Abrego Villas, as the organization will work to prevent any possible conflicts with tenant evictions in the future.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to support the tenants in their legal process and provide assistance,” Bogdanov said. “Not just legal but also emotional.

Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), which only controls I.V.’s numerous parks.</p>\n<p>The town hall was hosted by Assemblyman and AB 3 author Das Williams and divided attendees into small groups to discuss possibilities such as a utility tax, a parking tax, a transient occupy tax, a marijuana-dispensary tax, a Goleta sales tax and a party registration tax to fund the potential CSD. Taxation will fund I.V. public services including improved lighting and a parking program, among others.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61226\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61226\" data-attachment-id=\"61226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/das-williams-discussing-the-bill-with-a-community-member/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424480668\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"97\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61226\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Assemblyman Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.

Attendees also favored the possible implementation of a parking program to generate additional revenues, as well as the establishment of a rental-tenant mediation board to sort out issues between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>Utilities taxable under most models presented at the meeting include water, internet, cable, gas and trash with special exemptions to low-income families under certain models.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill language includes powers for a CSD to contract for additional public safety services such as community service officers; a rental housing mediation task force; a municipal advisory council, which would allow the CSD to advise the county on additional policy for I.V.; and an area planning commission similar to one existing in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee (SBCC) and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the three most likely types of tax for I.V. students and residents are a utilities tax; a creative sales deliveries tax, which refers to marijuana dispensary delivery taxes; and parcel taxes, which tax properties and are primarily used to fund public education.</p>\n<p>“I think what was presented here were great,” Abboud said. “The ideas were helpful and I think the utilities tax will be the number one idea and we should definitely have that one. The creative sales deliveries tax will be good as well, which involves marijuana. A small parcel tax will also work.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the marijuana tax could be beneficial for I.V. residents because many users and non-users alike favor taxing marijuana for city revenue.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, a marijuana tax came up a lot and the utilities tax is the most popular,” Williams said. “Marijuana advocates believe that it should be taxed and it seems like they mean it; this would also help students out. It can also be paid for.”</p>\n<p>Coffee Collaborative owner Steve McDonough said he does not support the utilities tax, which charges utility users for consumption of electricity, gas, water, sewer, telephone, sanitation and cable television. According to McDonough, he would have to spend more money on necessary utilities to keep his coffee business afloat.</p>\n<p>“I do not like the utilities tax,” McDonough said. “I own a coffee shop and I use so much utility every day. A utilities tax raise would cost me more money.”</p>\n<p>McDonough also said he does not see the reason behind transient taxes, a tax aimed at out-of-towners who stay at a hotel or motel, because there are no hotels in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As for the transient tax, we do not even have any hotels in Isla Vista so I do not see the point in transient taxes,” McDonough said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he believes the proposed party registration tax is not a “real” tax because it is not implemented anywhere else.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61229\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61229\" data-attachment-id=\"61229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/community-members-brainstorm-ideas-for-service-funding/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424482130\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000125\",\"title\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61229\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Community members, such as Jay Freeman, above, brainstorm ideas for service funding.

Hosted by A.S. President Ali Guthy and A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau, the forum informed students about and addressed questions regarding the proposed plan.</p>\n<p>According to Lau, students who currently receive financial aid are allocated around $2,600 to cover health insurance costs no matter whether or not they waive GHI, which is the reason behind the financial office’s plan to reduce aid.</p>\n<p>“Currently, students who have a certain need level all get financial aid for GHI at $2,600. Even though your expenses are less, even if you waive out, you still get that much if you’re the same need level as someone who still participates in Gaucho Health Insurance,” Lau said. “That was the concern that the financial aid office had and that’s why they proposed this new financial aid package.”</p>\n<p>Lau said the financial aid office is apprehensive that students will purposely select inadequate health insurances costing significantly less than $2,600 instead of GHI to have excess financial aid money for other non-health purposes.</p>\n<p>“Their main concern was that people were getting so much money, this $2,600 for health insurance, but on average outside of UCSB the amount that you have to pay for health insurance is a lot less than that,” Lau said. “Let’s say its $1,500, so now students have an extra $1,000 so to them, it seemed like the $1,000 was enough to entice someone to essentially get a crap health insurance and they didn’t like that.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, students may still require the excess money to pay for necessities such as rent or food. The financial aid office contends the excess money should be used to provide aid to new students, or to students who previously applied unsuccessfully for aid due to the lack of funds.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, we were saying that while students are using that extra $1,000 for housing, or for textbooks, or for food, they still need that money,” Guthy said. “But the financial aid office’s argument is that well if we take that $1,000 back, so instead of giving you the $2,600 when your health insurance only costs $1,500 we take $1,000 away, we can spend that money to allocate more financial aid to more students.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said aid money is still necessary to cover additional healthcare costs for those without GHI.</p>\n<p>“I would say that even if you are on your parents’ plan that doesn’t mean you don’t have healthcare costs,” Mancini said. “What if you’re on your parents plan and you have to go to the hospital for some reason or you’re on an expensive drug? You’re still paying for healthcare you’re still paying for the price of those drugs or the price of that pay in some way or another.”<br>\nAccording to Guthy, health insurance is required for all students, and the financial aid office’s original proposal would not provide any financial aid money for health insurance unless it is GHI.</p>\n<p>“It’s essentially saying, ‘You can either have this health insurance or we’re not going to pay for anything else,’” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Lau said the initial plan would create a health insurance monopoly where students receiving financial aid are essentially forced to choose GHI.</p>\n<p>“It almost seemed like they were monopolizing the health insurance market for all students saying, ‘You have to have GHI to get financial aid for it,’” Lau said.</p>\n<p>A.S. met with the financial aid office for a revised plan, which will involve surveying students to determine a health insurance industry average that students will be given if they choose to waive GHI, instead of the original proposal which would not allocate any money for health costs, according to Guthy.</p>\n<p>“We came up with a preliminary agreement that the financial aid office would pay an industry standard to students who waive out of Gaucho Health Insurance,” Guthy said. “They’re planning to conduct a survey to all students who opt out of Gaucho Health Insurance to see kind of what kinds they have to define what this industry standard is.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said students who choose an insurance plan above the surveyed industry standard can still receive financial aid to cover the difference.</p>\n<p>“If your health insurance happens to be greater than the industry average but below Gaucho Health Insurance you can still go into the financial aid office and get a grant to cover your health insurance,” Guthy said, “All you need to do is come in with a bill and they’ll pay for it.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the financial aid office established the proposal to allocate money more efficiently so that students receive the precise monetary amount they require and no more.</p>\n<p>“The kind of motivation behind this is to make the spending of financial aid more efficient,” Guthy said. “They want you to spend the money to the exact level that you need, they don’t want you to have excess. And they’re arguing if we give you more money for health insurance than you need, that’s excess and we don’t want you to have excess.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Alex Hill said the financial aid office allocates a certain amount of financial aid specifically for health purposes, and any excess portion of that amount not being used for health is deemed wasteful by the financial aid office.</p>\n<p>“You have a lot of students who are either shopping on the market and getting a cheaper plan, or are on their parents plan and ultimately their costs are reduced. Students are having say between $500 and $1,000 per year extra money that is not going to health costs,” Hill said. “According to the financial aid office, based off their breakdown, technically we’re wasting money, so we need to adjust our standards so it’s more strict.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/","id":2878,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2877,2876,2875],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LAFCO Issues Letter on AB 3","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) formally approved the release a letter of concern on Isla Vista self-governance bill AB 3 by a 5-2 vote at a special meeting of the commissi...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61166\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61166\" data-attachment-id=\"61166\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/jeff-moorhouse-listens-to-a-ucsb-student-share-his-view-on-the-proposed-bill/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.3\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Jeff Moorhouse listens to a UCSB student share his view on the proposed bill.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424357608\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"220\",\"iso\":\"2200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"Jeff Moorhouse listens to a UCSB student share his view on the proposed bill.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61166\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-3-1024x678.jpg?resize=600%2C398\" alt=\"Jeff Moorhouse listens to a UCSB student share his view on the proposed bill.

LAFCO is a state-mandated agency present in every California county to oversee the formation of CSDs. AB 3 would establish, by act of the state legislature, an I.V. CSD and thereby bypass the traditional role of LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>The letter was drafted and released at LAFCO’s Feb. 5 meeting and enumerates 11 concerns held by the commission over the bill, primarily regarding the bill’s current lack of specificity over the types of services that would be available in an I.V. CSD and how they would be paid for. Additional concerns questioned the role of the county, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) and UCSB in a CSD, the makeup of the administrative board in a CSD and how the CSD would be governed after it is formed.</p>\n<p>The commission heard over two dozen speakers during its roughly hour-long public comment period, with primarily I.V. residents, property owners and students voicing their concerns. Following public comment, the commission debated the merits of sending the letter, with commissioners Second District Supervisor Janet Wolf along with LAFCO chair and Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr voicing opposition.</p>\n<p>Commissioners Craig Geyer, Jeff Moorhouse, Roger Aceves, Roger Welt and Jim Richardson voted in favor of issuing the letter, with Farr and Wolf voting against.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61164\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61164\" data-attachment-id=\"61164\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/doreen-farr-speaks-at-the-lafco-meeting-on-february-19th/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.3\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on February 19th.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424355612\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"220\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on February 19th.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61164\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on Feb. 19.

We already have law enforcement there,” Mitchell said. “We have a government that deals with those issues already … by creating more government you are asking the students to pay more, you are asking the residents to pay more … we have enough government in Isla Vista already.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61165\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61165\" data-attachment-id=\"61165\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/lafco_christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424356580\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"155\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61165\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.

By overturning our role in the process to a board like LAFCO we remove our hand from this important step.”</p>\n<p>Schunk also said LAFCO should work to ease tensions between residents of I.V. and LAFCO in order to allow the community to address the concerns the commission is taking on AB 3.</p>\n<p>“We as a community have some trust issues with you all and I would feel that as a board who is made to represent the interests and assert the interests of local districts you would all be willing to compromise with us on that and understand that,” Schunk said. “By allowing us the determination of continuing these talks … you allow us to move forward and answer the very questions you have presented.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman has agreed to work on a financial feasibility study for an I.V. CSD, and sociology professor Victor Rios has begun an effort to attain $18,000 of university money to fund a demographics study of I.V., to meet the concerns of the LAFCO. Schunk and other speakers also encouraged LAFCO commissioners attend the weekly stakeholders meetings taking place in I.V. to flesh out the specifics of the bill.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Geyer said LAFCO members may be limited in their ability to attend stakeholders meetings because of the Brown Act, a piece of legislation guaranteeing the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies.</p>\n<p>“It is hard for commissioners to come to meetings because of the Brown Act,” Geyer said. “We can violate the Brown Act in a very easy manner and I think that’s probably why a lot of us don’t attend.”</p>\n<p>Following public comment, commissioner Moorhouse said LAFCO’s purpose is to create local governments and to encourage county, state and university administrations to assist in demographic and financial feasibility studies.</p>\n<p>“Opposing AB 3 does not mean that LAFCO opposes I.V. self-governance,” Moorhouse said, “LAFCO exists to create local governance, among other things. We are here to help and there is an established process to follow and it works.”</p>\n<p>According to a 2006 law updating the CSD formation process, part of LAFCO’s role in creating a CSD is to ensure 25 percent of residents of the proposed CSD area sign a petition indicating support for the effort.</p>\n<p>Geyer said LAFCO’s role is to ensure public participation in the CSD formation process and expressed concern about inaccessibility of the bill once it moves along in the legislative process.</p>\n<p>“The formation of anything, any special district in Isla Vista, should come back to the local LAFCO. That’s what we are here for. That’s why the legislature invented LAFCO, and LAFCO locally [allows] the public to be involved,” Geyer said. “When this thing heads up to Sacramento, you think you have a hard time making it here [to downtown Santa Barbara], you’re gonna have a real hard time making it up there.”</p>\n<p>The commission amended the several points on the letter before approving it for release. The commission eliminated the first sentence on point three, which falsely stated the bill was introduced in December without public outreach on the concept, when in fact two town hall-style meetings had occurred in the months prior to determine an appropriate form of local government for I.V.</p>\n<p>The commission amended language on point three to reflect concerns that LAFCO would be bypassed as a result of “commission meetings” rather than “community meetings” because of a lack of familiarity with the content of the stakeholders and town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>On item nine, the commission deleted the final sentence, which stated “LAFCO has no authority to deviate from the CSD law regarding makeup of the CSD board” and inserted, “However, if it is determined that state legislation is needed, it could be requested by Santa Barbara LAFCO.”</p>\n<p>On item 11, the language was changed from “if the Isla Vista CSD is formed with LAFCO approval” to “if Isla Vista CSD is formed without LAFCO approval, would the district be subject to the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act after the … CSD is formed?”</p>\n<p>Finally, the commission agreed to issue the revised letter undersigned by LAFCO executive officer Paul Hood, rather than LAFCO chair Farr, who opposed moving forward with the letter and had her name signed to the draft released Feb. 5.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/","id":4791,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[4790,4789,4788],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Assemblyman Holds I.V.

St. George &amp; Associates plans to terminate the Ambassador Program starting next year and may convert it to a scholarship program where students will no longer be able to choose which service events to participate in.</p>\n<p>St. George &amp; Associates owner Ed St. George said he is ending the current Ambassador Program to prevent further dispute with tenants over the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to fight with people anymore,” St. George said. “I’m terminating what I think was probably one of the most innovative community programs that you could put in a college community.”</p>\n<p>In order to prevent further complications, St. George said he plans to change the Ambassador Program to a scholarship program where students no longer choose their own community service activities.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to do a scholarship program next year and I’m not letting kids pick the events anymore — it’s not going to happen,” St. George said. “They broke my heart this year.”</p>\n<p>Ambassador Program director Mark Capritto said residents avoided the proper types of events for the program, which asked tenants to perform community service.<br>\n“[The residents] didn’t do what they were told,” Capritto said. “You can’t just pick and choose what you want to do — you do the program.”</p>\n<p>According to Capritto, St. George &amp; Associates would often turn down the reward for tenants who did activities like donating blood or working on campus, which he felt did not directly help the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“Some people were saying, ‘Well I gave blood. That should help somebody in Isla Vista.’ We said, ‘No you can’t count that.’ People started doing all these things that they felt were contributing, and — bless their hearts — that’s what they do,” Capritto said. “Certainly donating blood is a worthy prospect, but it didn’t meet the needs of those people who were actually paying to have it done.”</p>\n<p>Capritto said he supports the idea of converting the Ambassador Program into a scholarship program, but maintained he is opposed to terminating the program altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really want to walk away from this,” Capritto said. “Ed [St. George] asked me a year ago to come in and look after it, and I said I would.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Legal Resource Center attorney Robin Unander said tenants asked for attorney service as early as October when disputes arose between residents and St. George &amp; Associates over how many hours were required for each community service event and what kinds of service activities qualified under the program.</p>\n<p>“There was such a firestorm of frustration that some tenants had to lawyer up and try to see what they could do to try and get [St. George &amp; Associates] to comply,” Unander said. “One student lawyered up last October.”</p>\n<p>According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates has made it difficult for students to adhere to the community service requirement of the program. She said the property management company kept “moving the carrot,” and students found themselves having to complete additional requirements to receive their reward.</p>\n<p>“There’s so much of a shit-storm going on over there with students who rightfully complied with their contractual obligations,” Unander said. “They jumped through the hoops that they were told they had to jump through, but the hoops kept moving.”</p>\n<p>According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates changed the qualifications to avoid paying for the 20 percent difference created by the rent discounts, which she said cost the company more expenses than it anticipated.</p>\n<p>“I think the Ambassador Program ended up being more expensive than what they originally estimated,” Unander said. “They probably had more tenants qualify for it than what they thought would, so then that became an expensive experiment.”</p>\n<p>According to Unander, Capritto has no legal authority to change the language of the program because the program’s specifications are bound within the lease contract.</p>\n<p>“The Ambassador Program is incorporated into the lease contract, so they have to honor it just like they have to honor every single clause contained within that contract,” Unander said. “The sad part is that whoever this Mark Capritto person is, he’s lacking the knowledge about contract law.”</p>\n<p>Capritto said the attorneys who argue that St. George &amp; Associates cannot change the language of the Ambassador Program hold a different view on the function of the rental organization.</p>\n<p>“I’m not an attorney, but what I can tell you is that is coming from an attorney who’s protecting their client,” Capritto said. “I know where the attorneys are coming from, but that’s their interpretation of what an organization does.”</p>\n<p>According to Capritto, St. George &amp; Associates is allowed to alter the Ambassador Program at any time it wants as part of its rights as an organization.<br>\n“We’re an organization,” Capritto said. “We reserve the right to restructure ourselves.”</p>\n<p>A Campus 880 resident and second-year student who spoke on condition of anonymity said the Ambassador Program required she complete 16 hours of community service per year upon signing her lease, but that number has now increased to 64 hours per year. She said she fears she may not obtain the minimum amount of hours because the number has increased and St. George &amp; Associates limited what events she could participate in.</p>\n<p>“They didn’t let us choose our own volunteer work in Isla Vista,” the tenant said in an email. “It makes it more difficult to accumulate hours, and we can’t pursue volunteer work in the areas of our choosing, like we used to be able to.”</p>\n<p>The tenant also said St. George &amp; Associates was imbalanced by giving credit to residents who did not properly complete their community service.</p>\n<p>“Some students who didn’t complete the volunteer hours simply got their hours signed off by a Campus 880 representative, and they were told they could ‘make up the hours later,’” the tenant said in an email. “This is unfair as this option wasn’t available to all students.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the February 19, 2015 print version of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/","id":4773,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4772,4771,4770],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Meeting Discusses CSD Alternative","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams-Stakeholder-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams-Stakeholder-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, university administrators and Santa Barbara County officials met Tuesday night in the I.V.

Clinic for the weekly I.V. self-governance meeting organized by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office.</p>\n<p>This week, attendees discussed whether to create a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) instead of or in addition to a Community Services District (CSD). Discussions at previous self-governance meetings had been primarily focused on forming a CSD, but it is still unclear exactly what form of self-governance will be proposed by Williams’ Assembly Bill 3, which aims to create self-government in I.V. in order to provide infrastructure and services to I.V. residents. The group also discussed efforts to understand the demographics and needs of the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, a member of  Williams’ district office staff, said the creation of a CSD requires more discussion time because it is more complicated than the creation of a MAC.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking about the CSD option so in-depth because it’s so complicated and covers so many areas,” Elliott said. “We’re going to talk about Municipal Advisor Councils today, which is an alternative to the CSD. I.V. had one in the 70’s and 80’s that was dissolved, so we’re talking about maybe bringing that back.”</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, cityhood discussions cannot begin until organizers have a better idea of I.V.’s potential financial situation.</p>\n<p>“The cityhood plan we can’t really talk about until we find out if it’s financially feasible,” Elliott said. “The CSD is so complicated and has so many layers we’ve been focusing our meetings on that.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and local business owner Jay Freeman said it was not made clear at the meeting whether an I.V. CSD would be feasible.</p>\n<p>“It’s not actually clear that a CSD itself is financially feasible,” Freeman said. “I only say that because I take some issue with the notion that cityhood cannot be discussed because we don’t know whether it’s financially feasible but there’s a base assumption that a CSD can be discussed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar however said stakeholders should not be content to create only a MAC.</p>\n<p>“I think that the MAC is a great thing for us to be able to utilize, due to the fact that a CSD would take about 16 months for it to be formed,” Minoiefar said. “However, I wouldn’t want the momentum, the political feasibility that we have right now to be spent only on a MAC. This is our chance to do something very big, like institute a very strong institution that can be here for decades to come because it’s self-sustaining.”</p>\n<p>Longtime resident Sue Dixon said she is concerned that there would not be adequate funding and support with a MAC.</p>\n<p>“It had been more than 10 years since we had a disaster and support for Isla Vista just died as part of that cycle. We get another disaster and people start pouring resources back and we’ve seen this happen,” Dixon said. “This is why I think we should have permanent funding for a MAC. I think a MAC is a great idea. I would like to see permanent funding because I don’t trust the county to keep going with it.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said the both MAC and the CSD could be created.</p>\n<p>“I don’t view these two things as mutually exclusive and I hope no one in this room does,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District board member Pegeen Soutar said a MAC was established in 1972 because of the unrest in I.V. and founded many of the current institutions in I.V., including IVRPD and IVFP.</p>\n<p>“It was actually pretty huge at the time,” Soutar said. “I.V. Parks and Rec actually came out of a combination of the Community Council and the MAC. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol, the idea of the Foot Patrol, came out of the MAC. The Isla Vista Health Clinic came out of the MAC. These are all institutions that still exist that came from this beginning seed of people coming together.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Trustee Jonathan Abboud said he is working to put out a survey of I.V. residents on how they would like potential tax dollars be spent in I.V., as well as the possibility of performing a census in I.V.</p>\n<p>“People don’t know the exact technicalities, but they understand the taxes pretty well,” Abboud said. “They knew that they needed more money if they wanted these services. Parking and lighting was overwhelmingly what people would put their money towards. We were thinking of doing a census that would be going door to door and asking ‘How many people live in your apartment?’”</p>\n<p>Spatial Arts Professor Kim Yasuda said she would be willing to survey university faculty living in the faculty housing units adjacent to I.V.</p>\n<p>“Has anyone gone over to faculty housing and canvased them?” Yasuda said. “That’s a tax-paying base. I think we could get permission to get on the list serve or something … That’s 65 units of probably 200 people.”</p>\n<p>The stakeholders created a preliminary list of broad, amendable goals for a CSD to add to the AB 3 language so that the bill can continue forward in the legislature. The list includes the creation of a MAC, a tenant mediation program, a parking program and the building of community facilities. The tentative list of goals will be discussed further at next week’s meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/","id":4771,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4770,4769,4768],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Prof. Discusses Pros, Cons of Fracking","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"University of Wyoming Economics Professor and UW Chair in Petroleum and Natural Gas Economics Charles Mason gave a lecture at Bren Hall titled \"To Frack or Not to Frack?” in which he discussed some ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61005\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61005\" data-attachment-id=\"61005\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/prof-discusses-pros-cons-of-fracking/mason-fracking-talk_paris-cullen-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=4272%2C2848&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4272,2848\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424178325\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mason Fracking Talk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61005\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-1-1024x683.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"University of Wyoming professor Charles Mason discusses the pros and cons of fracking last night.

Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into underground rock in order to force it open and extract oil or gas. Mason specializes in Environmental and Resource Economics and is an associate editor of the <em>European Economic Review</em>, co-editor of the <em>Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists</em> and joint editor-in-chief of <em>Strategic Behavior in the Environment.</em></p>\n<p>Mason began his lecture by addressing the economic advantages behind fracking such as increased employment from fracking-related jobs as well as an increase in the supply of natural gas for consumers worldwide.</p>\n<p>“With this kind of expansion in production you have a large increase in supply,” Mason said. “That generally means two things to people who use natural gas — greater ability and lower prices. This is the kind of thing that politicians would naturally glom onto.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, another advantage brought on by fracking includes a decrease in carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>“This big increase in the production of natural gas has lead to a displacement of coal as a source for producing electricity, which in turn means a reduction of carbon emissions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>However, Mason said the potential water contamination caused by hydraulic reinjection is a major concern regarding fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“A particular amount of the angst about fracking, I think, has to do with the potential for groundwater contamination,” Mason said. “The contaminated water that comes from the frack job is the larger consideration.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61006\" style=\"width:

id=\"caption-attachment-61006\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Mason, research on the exact environmental costs of fracking has been hindered by the incomplete record keeping on the part of natural gas companies.</p>\n<p>“Until relatively recently, there was considerable lack of transparency about what was being done,” Mason said. “We don’t know what’s in the chemical compounds that are being used as part of the frack job, we don’t know how dangerous it is … we don’t know whether or not we should worry about this getting into our groundwater.”</p>\n<p>Mason also said his research on water contamination, which is his focus regarding his studies on fracking in Sublette County, Wyoming, has shown him the extent of companies’ inadequacy in reporting fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“There’s asymmetric information,” Mason said. “The firms that are undertaking these jobs know exactly what they’re injecting, but we know nothing.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, he uses company reports to research the consequences of fracking, and his findings have shown that some potentially toxic ingredients of the fracking process are left out as “trade secrets.”</p>\n<p>“They do have specific information of the ingredients that were used, subject to trade secrets exceptions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>First-year student in the Bren School master’s program Leah Fine said Mason’s lecture reinforced material she has learned in her environmental policy classes.</p>\n<p>“Especially since being at Bren, I’ve become more interested in the production of groundwater resources,” Fine said. “It was a cool tie-in with some of the curriculum here at the Bren School, and I thought it was really interesting to hear how different companies disclose information.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year student in the Bren School master’s program Hye Min Park, it was useful to hear about the practical applications of fracking outside of the classroom.</p>\n<p>“This is a really specific issue that I don’t always get to learn about in lectures,” Park said, “I thought it was really interesting to see how it is applied in the real world.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Pakistan Marc Grossman visited campus this past Friday to speak to students at the global studies department about his 30-year career with the U.S. Foreign Service.</p>\n<p>As a former diplomat and government official, Grossman also worked as the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, which is the State Department’s third ranking official. As Under Secretary, Grossman assembled diplomatic support for the U.S. after the September 11 attacks, and as U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan he supported the Afghan peace process and worked to improve U.S.-Pakistan relations.</p>\n<p>Grossman, who was born in Los Angeles, received a degree in political science from UCSB, and said one of his professors saw his potential after two years at the university.</p>\n<p>“He arranged for me to go on the Education Abroad Program,” Grossman said. “I’d never left the state of California before, and hours later we landed in London.”</p>\n<p>Grossman then got his master’s degree in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science before returning to Santa Barbara. Grossman said after returning and working in Santa Barbara for several years, he sought a career that would cater to his passion.</p>\n<p>“I came back to Santa Barbara, where I worked for three years — a year in politics and a couple years selling things door to door, which turned out to be great experience,” Grossman said. “One day I said to myself, I have got to find a profession that is going to pay me to live abroad and be curious about how other people live.”</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, he passed the Foreign Service exam at UCSB, then the oral exam at the Federal Building in Los Angeles, and in March of 1976 joined the Foreign Service and moved to the East Coast.</p>\n<p>Grossman said one of his biggest accomplishments during his time in the Foreign Service was working to dissuade the Turkish government from using torture when handling prisoners.</p>\n<p>“We were able to convince Turks that this kind of abuse — the systematic abuse of people — was just wrong,” Grossman said.</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, diplomacy is always changing, and he is excited to see college students majoring in fields like global studies and considering international careers.</p>\n<p>“The world is changing so fast, and these interactions are changing so fast,” Grossman said. “I teach to a lot of brand new American diplomats, and I envy them. They are really going to lead our engagement in the world for a very long time to come.”</p>\n<p>Grossman said students today are lucky to have more opportunities in the international field than he had when he started his career.</p>\n<p>“If you wanted to live that kind of life, diplomacy was basically the only way to do it,” Grossman said. “The choices that you all now have with non-governmental organizations, with charities, with multilateral organizations, with businesses, with more ways that people are today employed abroad, are very exciting prospects.”</p>\n<p>Grossman also said he hopes some students will consider a career in diplomacy for the United States.</p>\n<p>“I hope you really will consider representing the United States,” Grossman said. “There’s no substitute for working in an office where you have the American flag flying.”</p>\n<p>Global Studies Professor Eve Darian-Smith said Grossman gave students insight into a career path many global studies students are considering to pursue.</p>\n<p>“The visit from former Ambassador Marc Grossman was very exciting and granted our Global Studies students a glimpse into the life of a leading diplomat working at the frontlines of U.S. foreign policy in extremely difficult political contexts,” Darian-Smith said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and psychology double major Edixon Puglisi said it is important that those who are “experts of their craft” convey their experiences to students.</p>\n<p>“It is very important to pass down to new generations the keys to success in each field of study, as well as the experiences of success and failure in each field, in such a way so that we may learn from our mistakes and become more efficient and effective individuals in society,” Puglisi said.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Harrison Marshall said listening Grossman’s talk actually helped him finalize his decision to apply to work for the U.S.</p>\n<p>“For me personally it gave me a lot of perspective on what I want to be pursuing with my life,” Marshall said. “Because of the visit I’m most definitely going to be applying for the State, which is something I had only considered before.”</p>\n<p>According to Darian-Smith, the Q&amp;A session following Grossman’s talk gave many students insight into the nuances of a career in foreign diplomacy.</p>\n<p>“It was a unique opportunity for students to ask the Ambassador direct questions, which he answered with candor, grace and humor,” Darian-Smith said. “Students’ minds were opened up to the contradictions and unpredictability of navigating foreign relations across different cultures, religions and worldviews, and the visit provided an invaluable ‘real-life’ teaching moment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The campaign calls for the Abrego Villas property manager Majestic Asset Management, LLC to abide by Santa Barbara County Ordinance No. 4444, stating landlords must provide relocation funds to tenants if five or more are evicted within 90 days of each other. The evicted tenants, most of who are low income Latino families, have filed a small claims lawsuit with a hearing scheduled for early March, and officials with IVTU and the Associated Students Legal Resource Center estimate the tenants are entitled to up to $10,500 each in county benefits.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60969\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60969\" data-attachment-id=\"60969\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/isla-vista-continues-tenants-rights-campaign/ivtu-march-2-13_christine-skari-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?fit=1069%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1069,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March 2-13_Christine Skari-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60969\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8-684x1024.jpg?resize=268%2C401\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"268\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?w=1069&amp;ssl=1 1069w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60969\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>During the event, protesters made beaded bracelets with words like “justice” and “tenants” on them and the IVTU distributed free IVTU shirts and sandwiches. Protesters then marched the streets and chanted slogans including “Tenants United, Will Never Be Divided!” and “Fight! Fight! Fight! Housing Is A Right.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy major and IVTU Development Director Alejandro Sanchez said the tenants union organized the demonstration in order to bring attention to an issue that he said effects all residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>“Some people might think that we’re just here for the six families, but that’s not necessarily true,” Sanchez said. “The six families are part of the community and as a whole were just trying to help them out. At the end of the day, it’s not just for them. It’s for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, who attended the march, said the evictions at Abrego Villas are the latest in a history of similar housing issues in I.V.</p>\n<p>“They’ve been doing it for years now and it’s not a new thing, evicting people,” Minoiefar said. “It reflects how the landlords here feel that they can do whatever they want — in terms of rent, in terms of upkeep, everything. Housing issues here are ridiculous. And this is just one of the worst ways in which they abuse their power.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology and political science double major Cameron Schunk said outside management companies need to recognize I.V. is not a “lawless” area where tenants’ rights violations can go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>“Where I come from, if people next door were evicted en mass, there would be uproar and there would be protest,” Schunk said. “We’re coming together and saying, ‘Not in our community … You cannot just come here and take advantage of renters. That’s not how it works.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60966\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60966\" data-attachment-id=\"60966\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/isla-vista-continues-tenants-rights-campaign/ivtu-march-2-13_christine-skari-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=1069%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1069,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March 2-13_Christine Skari-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60966\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5-684x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C599\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?w=1069&amp;ssl=1 1069w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60966\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Schunk, student and I.V. resident participation in demonstrations is vital to bringing the evicted tenant situation to justice.</p>\n<p>“Exposing the fact that these things are happening is paramount,” Schunk said. “As well as gathering community interest to fight these occurrences in the future.

According to Riley’s Facebook and Twitter posts, this caused university staff and faculty, including Black Studies professor Gaye Theresa Johnson, to reverse the decision and allow The Coup to perform.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead said The Coup had difficulty with the university’s insurance policy because campuswide insurance carrier Campus Connexxus does not provide coverage for hip hop artists. According to Armistead, hip-hop artists in the past have been able to perform because they had their own insurance, but The Coup did not.</p>\n<p>“The insurance carrier does not provide coverage for hip-hop,” Armistead said in an email. “When this is the case, the artists that want to come to campus must supply their insurance coverage. The Coup does not have its own insurance.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said the MCC’s request that the insurance requirement be waived so The Coup could play was originally denied, but that she then worked with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services to get the requirement waived.</p>\n<p>“When I learned that a waiver was denied I worked with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services to correct the decision,” Armistead said in an email. “Once it was deemed that there was no security issue with the group coming to campus, the decision to not waive the insurance requirement was reversed. So, the show will go on.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said while she was able to help get the insurance waived within 24 hours, the outbreak on social media created a “storm.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59865\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59865\" data-attachment-id=\"59865\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/concert-almost-canceled-over-insurance-concerns/mcc_file-photo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,682\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"11\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1398169298\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MCC/Entrance_File Photo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59865\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo-1024x682.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"MCC/Entrance_File Photo\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59865\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">View of the outside of the MultiCultural Center building on campus. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo.</em></p></div>\n<p>“The issue was corrected within 24 hours of the original decision,” Armistead said. “Unfortunately, the social media storm started while we were already working on the issue.”</p>\n<p>KCSB Development Coordinator Ted Coe said it was odd that the university would not provide insurance to The Coup for playing hip hop music.</p>\n<p>“It’s like there is a certain artistic expression, but then you’re told that expression isn’t welcome on campus,” Coe said.</p>\n<p>First-year economics and mathematics major George Purtell said he was disappointed to hear The Coup might not be able to play on campus this Friday.</p>\n<p>“The Coup is always playing on my iPod,” Purtell said. “I was looking forward to seeing them, but when I saw Boots Riley’s post on Facebook, I was definitely disappointed with the university.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Purtell said he was glad the insurance requirement was eventually waived and that the university is now allowing The Coup to play their upcoming show.</span></p>\n<p>“I was definitely relieved to hear that it all worked out in the end,” Purtell said. “I will be the first one there to see them on Friday night.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Listen to The Coup on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ5hD-fpksO0-7xLoBq3lTw\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> or <a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/artist/4IvS1ZZ5nyiNMheybfx3Hf\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
