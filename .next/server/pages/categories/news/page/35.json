He also noted that the general student body “isn’t necessarily up to par” on what the organization does and where student fees go, so he wants to change that and make sure students voices are “head at a state-wide and national level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has been working within the EVPSA office since her first year at UCSB – first as an EVPSA fellow, then as a community organizing director, and then as the legislative director – and now feels that she now has enough experience to run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as students are the future of the state, of this county, and we deserve to have a space in these vocations and be able to speak to what it is you need in order to be successful, what our students need in order to be successful.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any experience organizing UCSB students at the statewide level, such as lobby, or with UC wide-work? What have your experiences shown you about some of the issues facing students today? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has had a lot of experience lobbying for students, again referencing her past three years in the EVPSA office. She further noted that she is a member of Lobby Corps, and has been organizing student trips to the U.S. Senate, the legislator and Capitol Hill through this entire past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They need to hear where they’re at because they are living in this bubble, this congressional bubble. I’m going to be able to pop that and say, ‘hey, we are your students. We are who elected you and you need to be able to listen to us and take our student concerns into value.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley referenced his work on </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-14/summer-cal-grant-bill-reintroduced/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill 3153</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a bill to extend the Cal Grant into summer sessions, stating that he and other students would “drive up to Sacramento at ungodly hours to testify at these hearings and train different students on what they’re testifying on behalf of UC.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve really seen the beauty and power that comes with organizing students. I absolutely love it and I appreciate every moment of getting to help students fight for the fight.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Can you name some of the communities on the UCSB campus that you believe are the most marginalized? As the new EVPSA, how would you attempt to amplify these voices that you have mentioned and how do you ensure that students of all backgrounds are represented?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said Black students are the most marginalized community at UCSB, making up 4% of the campus. He said Black students don’t get the same institutional support that other groups may have, and said that either he or someone on his staff would be in attendance at Black Student Union (BSU) board meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said that while he cannot speak to the experiences of other marginalized students on campus, he would make sure to compose his office of people from different backgrounds as to increase representation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it comes to legislation… on the floor right now, to reaffirm the standards for deadly force for police officers and UCPD and California as a whole, we really need Black students to advocate on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she wants to listen to all voices on campus, and would take those concerns to the “state, to the federal government, to the Regents because [everyone’s] experiences matter.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EVPSA is a servant to its community. It’s time to take that to the next level and I’m ready to serve my students at any capacity.” </span></p>\n<p><b>In the past year, have you had any direct involvement with the EVPSA office, and whether you have or not, what would you change about the office?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva repeated that fact that she has been in the office these past three years, noting the hardships that came with not having an EVPSA this past year. She added that her work as a Resident Assistant and as a UCSB tour guide gives her a “unique perspective” and further knowledge as to how to serve students best. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley also referenced the lack of an EVPSA during this past year, stating that “put students in a very hard position.” He added that the lack of someone in that position forced students into “non-institutional routes” to try and make change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he worked with 2017-2018 EVPSA Kristin Hsu during his first year, going on lobby trips and advocating for extending the Cal Grant. </span></p>\n<p><b>Thanks to the amazing work from UCSB’s voter registration volunteer coalition, UCSB has set national records on voter registration and voter turnout. How would you work with UCSB’s student-run voter registration coalition to increase voter turnout even further into 2020? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said it’s “absolutely incredible” that UCSB has one of the highest registered voters out of any campus in the nation. He said that while civic engagement is already very important to UCSB students, that would be expanded to work with more organizations on campus by tabling and registering people to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know you might feel a little bit discouraged with the political climate right now, and it’s very easy to think that, ‘oh, national or any type of election doesn’t matter [because] our voices aren’t heard.’ But I’m here to say… that is not true. Each and every single voice counts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced the UC coordinator position within the office,  who “works tirelessly throughout the year to reinvigorate the [registration volunteer coalition program].” She added onto Beasley’s point by stating that she will expand that role, while also working to include the voices of students who don’t have the ability to vote. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you plan on getting students interested in attending EVPSA functions such as Regents meetings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said that accessibility has been an issue not just within the EVPSA office, but within A.S. overall. She said she would work to be as “transparent as possible.” She also noted that the office should table toward the beginning of the year in order to gauge issues that students care about, and then set up a system that would alert them when the office is doing work on an issue they care about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The work that these students are doing is fueled by passion and grit and the will to serve, and we need to be able to highlight that and show students, ‘these are what your students are doing. This is why they care. This is how you can get involved.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said his work as a Resident Assistant allowed him to see that marketing is the key to making sure students attend events. He said he wouldn’t let students know about events through “a robotic way, like through email.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Considering the budget restraints nationwide, what specific portion of the budget and Higher Education Act would you advocate for? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said specific numbers cannot be counted until it is known how much tax revenue California has. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The nation as a whole needs to prioritize education, needs to put that at the forefront, because education builds the leaders for tomorrow… Education is a right and people need to be educated on the issues that they’re fighting for.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced California Governor Gavin Newsoms’ budget that was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-newsom-allocates-400-million-to-uc-system-aiming-to-increase-student-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released earlier this year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She noted that while his goal for the UC system to intake more students is “fabulous,” it is ultimately hard to accommodate more students because “we can barely accommodate the ones we have.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we’re talking about budget asks, what we’re advocating for, we need to be looking at things like basic needs. We need to be looking at things and making sure we’re funding our resources. We need to be looking at things like deferred maintenance – we have buildings falling apart, we have elevators that you wouldn’t dare step in because you value your life.” </span></p>\n<p><b>What would be the very first issue you will tackle if you are elected as EVPSA? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said the first thing she would tackle is financial aid expansion. She added that she wants to bring back the pell grant and wants to look into expanding the middle class scholarship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without financial aid, I wouldn’t even be standing up here. You want to talk about subsidized housing, food stamps? That is me. Still will probably be me for a while, but it’s because of financial aid that I’m able to attend this university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said he wants to make sure that marginalized students’ voices are “uplifted and heard.” He said that, if elected, he would “bring these people that are often put at the bottom of the social hierarchy and make sure they’re brought to the top.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t have one person of color or one marginalized student there and expect them to advocate on behalf of everyone that’s not present. My first task in the office will be making sure that I have a diverse enough staff to be able to bring some of the issues [to me] that need to be talked about.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

How has your past experience prepared you for this future task? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you think about the class sign up process on G.O.L.D.? In the past, students have recommended a shopping cart on G.O.L.D. where students could favorite classes they want to take before their pass times. Do you believe G.O.L.D. is currently a convenient way to choose your classes or could it be better?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB offers several on-campus resources that many students don’t even know about, such as the Collaborate Print Labs that offer 200 free prints a quarter. Name any on-campus resource that you believe students as a whole could learn about and perhaps take advantage of in the future. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, 13 graduate student workers reported that a man was seen walking in the hallways of the sociology department wearing a shirt with an antisemitic phrase. This incident was reported by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it shows that even on-campus education buildings are not immune to antisemitism. As a collegiate senator, how would you attempt to combat antisemitism and ensure that people from all backgrounds are heard, valued and respected? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would your first line of action be if you are elected? </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responses to the issues presented by the questions, as well as candidates’ general goals, are summarized below:</span></p>\n<p><b>College of Engineering Candidates: </b></p>\n<p><b>Lim,</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a first-year chemical engineering major, believes that the greatest issue facing students in the College of Engineering is the stigma regarding mental health services. He said that, if elected, he wants to promote mental health awareness and wellness campaigns. Lim added that he is currently a part of the AIChE club at UCSB, which is a chemical engineering club; through that, he has experience in communicating with professors and students within his college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also wants to make a phone app geared toward S.T.E.M. and engineering students that would compile an inventory of different resources on campus that are “available to help people with their academic studies.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Reyes Carrillo, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year computer science major, said the greatest issue facing students in her college is accessibility to certain technologies. If elected, Reyes Carrillo plans to advocate for lendable laptops and 3D printers. Reyes Carrillo also said that she believes the two-party system should not exist, which is why she chose to run independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of how Reyes Carrillo would uplift the voices of LGBTQ students in her college, she mentioned the need for advocating for organizations such as oSTEM, which is an organization at UCSB aimed at promoting and supporting LGBTQ individuals in S.T.E.M. fields. Reyes Carrillo added that she believes the College of Engineering should have two senatorial seats. </span></p>\n<p><b>College of Letters and Science Candidates:</b></p>\n<p><b>Danielzadeh, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, said the greatest issue facing students in her college is over-enrollment. Danielzadeh wants to modify G.O.L.D. and update the waitlist system so that students with “upper standing who need certain classes to graduate on time have priority.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When meeting with the deans of the College of L&amp;S twice a quarter if elected, Danielzadeh hopes to “encourage the addition of new majors that are more fit with our current job market and what our generation is actually interested in.” Danielzadeh didn’t specify exactly which majors she would like added. She also wants to improve Campus Learning Assistive Services (C.L.A.S.) by offering one-on-one affordable tutoring for students. </span></p>\n<p><b>Campos, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a third-year sociology major, said the greatest issue facing students in the College of Letters &amp; Science is that the college does not have enough resources. Campos hopes to form a committee with honors students from different departments to “ensure that every student feels that their major concerns are being voiced.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Campos also wants to find a solution regarding textbook affordability by working with department heads and administrators on campus to gain funding to expand course reserves in the library.</span></p>\n<p><b>Chocron,</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an undeclared second-year, also believes that awareness surrounding mental health is the biggest issue facing students in his college. Chocron mentioned his involvement in Hillel, the Public Safety Commission and the Interfraternity Council, citing his ability to work with a variety of groups at UCSB and in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding the recent instances of antisemitism at UCSB, Chocron said that one solution is to hold “open spaces where leaders on our campus are able to educate students on the issue and let them form their own response and come up with their own ideas as to how they feel and what they should do.” He Chocron then emphasized that one of his biggest platform points is to ensure the safety of students and faculty at UCSB; he also said that UCSB needs to do a better job of making sure that students and faculty are aware of emergency policies.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

Abdullahi said she would like to give financial aid to working students who live in university-owned off-campus housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to try to see if I can work something out to get students who work above a certain amount of hours to get financial assistance,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi is also a proponent of strengthening the current bus services, as she finds that both freshmen living in the Santa Catalina Residence Halls and other students living in university-owned off-campus housing often have to “put in a little more effort to come to school on time.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s a huge inconvenience even when you live a mile away from campus,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi is also in favor of working with transfer senators, as she claims their constituents often overlap because many transfer students seek residence through university-owned off-campus housing as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve already been working with the current transfer senator that’s running… to do my job effectively, I will also have to be in close contact with people who are also representing the same groups of people that I’m representing,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi said the biggest issue with university-owned off-campus housing is the distance from campus, stating that the extended time it takes to campus is an inconvenience to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parking problems, an issue not necessarily specific to university-owned off-campus housing, was also a point of conversation during the forum. Abdullahi said she believes residents who live the farthest from campus should receive parking priority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tackle rising student fees, Abdullahi suggested “looking into the system to see where money is allocated” in order to reallocate funds to help combat the price hike. However, Abdullahi admitted that she is unfamiliar with the system but plans to become more familiar with it in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of accessibility, specifically between the student body and A.S., Abdullahi would like to bridge the gap by personally approaching students to understand their needs. Furthermore, she would like to augment the current level of representation of university-owned off-campus housing students by moving events that would typically occur on campus to off campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing what students need and asking them personally is something that I intend to do,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi added that she would have no problem holding meetings with students living in university-owned off-campus housing to help inform them of A.S. resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When discussing her background, Abdullahi noted that being a woman of color and a first generation student has allowed her to “walk through campus with a few different lenses,” which she believes will ultimately motivate her to be more “sympathetic” to the needs of students. As a Resident Assistant, Abdullahi said her immersion in different student communities has also helped broaden her horizons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you help everybody at the bottom, everybody else gets helped out as a result,” she said. </span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

A speaker has not yet been announced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the second time in recent years that the union has called for a boycott of commencement speakers. During Spring Quarter 2018, United States Senator and current presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Congressman John Lewis withdrew from speaking at UC Berkeley and UC San Diego respectively after AFSCME called for a boycott amidst contract negotiations, the press release states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union and the university have been negotiating over contracts for over two years. The main disputes between the two are over pay raises, outsourcing and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union has gone on strike several times during this period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous statement to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, UC Office of the President Director of Media Relations Claire Doan called the AFSCME’s demands “unreasonable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want raises that are nearly triple those given to other UC employees,” Doan said in the email. “We hope AFSCME leaders will channel more time and effort into actual bargaining.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the UC system, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-01/union-alleges-harassment-in-unfair-practice-charge-against-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alleging harassment and intimidation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during strikes over the past six months. The union subsequently went on strike following the filing of the charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The University of California has used intimidation tactics to keep workers from protesting over outsourcing and income inequality instead of negotiating in good faith,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Local 3299 President Kathryn Lybarger said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do not tolerate bullying.

id=\"caption-attachment-87605\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Adam is the sole candidate running for the position.<em> Andrea Verdugo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVP presides over the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate and has the power to serve as a tie-breaking vote. The IVP is also responsible for providing the A.S. Senate with various trainings and facilitating the completion of A.S. Senate group projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forum consisted of Adam answering A.S. Election Board’s questions for about 20 minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, Adam spoke to her qualifications to serve in the executive position, noting that she has been a College of Letters &amp; Science Senator this past year. Adam added that she has attended all but “one or two” A.S. Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam emphasized that her main goal is to implement trainings as soon as senators are sworn into office so they know “what is expected of them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also plans on having either herself or her first and second pro tempores hold one-on-one meetings with senators every quarter in order to check in on the projects they are working on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes the public should play a large role during Senate meetings and referenced a resolution she authored earlier this school year which called for scheduling public forum at the beginning of all Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she authored the resolution “so members of our community are encouraged to come and speak to their representatives and don’t have to guess what time to come at.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also mentioned her experience as a senator liaison to Take Back the Night, which is an anti-sexual violence organization, and The Bottom Line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I have effectively worked with those groups and really made sure they know what the Senate can do for them,” Adam said. “I’ve helped them update legal code; I publicize their events.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also believes senators should establish clear goals to meet with their Boards, Commissions, and Units (BCUs) at the beginning of the quarter, and senators should be subject to progress checks throughout the quarter regarding the work they’re doing with their BCUs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it comes to working with BCUs, whether it’s me or whether it’s my senators… it’s all about working smarter and not harder, so really figuring out exactly what these BCUs need and exactly what the Senate can do for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam identified the largest internal problem within A.S. as the everyday student not knowing what A.S does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In my time [in A.S.], [A.S.] has had this recurring problem that we only benefit and we only really interact with those who are already involved with A.S.,” Adams said. “We really need to do a much better job at getting awareness and our resources and our benefits to the students who aren’t already involved with us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam wants to work with other executive offices to create an A.S. mobile application that would consist of all of the A.S. resources incoming first-year students need. The students could download the app during orientation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of what has prepared Adam to chair Senate meetings, Adam referenced her public speaking skills, adding that she has participated in Mock Trial, debate and musical theater. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have no problem taking command of a room and really asserting control so that Senate is running more efficiently, that members of the public are respected and so that everyone in the room is taking space and making space and being heard when it is allowed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to how Adam would maintain civility while leading a Senate with members that come from two different political parties, Adam said she plans on being nonpartisan and neutral. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam then went on to discuss how she would conduct trainings differently than how they were conducted this past year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This past year, our trainings didn’t come until the middle of winter quarter, which not only stifled how productive we could be, but it’s also against legal code.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said she would make training a priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam went on to discuss the connections she has developed with UCSB administration, stating that she served on the Faculty Executive Committee and was an intern at the Mosher Alumni House. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam’s first line of action, if elected, would be to create a mission statement for the 70th Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want [the mission statement] to be a physical banner that we hang in the Flying A room every Wednesday night, so there is a clear standard and clear purpose [so] that all senators know why we are here… so we start off on the right foot regardless of how elections go.”</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

Elections Board about how they would lead A.S. in the 2019-20 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon and Sir advocated for many of the same issues, such as furthering transparency and extending outreach of A.S. activities to the student body. Still, they differ on the main projects they wish to create through the year, as well as their prior experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon currently serves as an on-campus senator for A.S. as well as Finance and Business Chair. Prior to their election as a senator last year, Solomon worked for A.S. Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) and was an A.S. Fellow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir emphasized her background outside of A.S. during the debate, such as her work alleviating food insecurity over the past year, her position as vice president of finance for the Panhellenic Council and her experiences as a summer orientation leader and desk attendant. Sir was also an off-campus senator during the 2017-18 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the forum, Sir noted that taking a break from A.S. involvement benefited her ability to serve the students and understand the failures of A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realized that A.S. only benefits people in A.S. and their entities, and it doesn’t really help the average UCSB student at Isla Vista,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I want to do is more outreach and really help students who don’t know about the resources A.S. can do to help you be successful on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each of the candidates spoke at length during the debate about the main projects they hope to develop if elected as A.S. President. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon discussed three main projects for their term: a career development program through the A.S. website, instituting an A.S. alerts system and creating a financial aid advisory position through the A.S. office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon cited their past experience developing the Finance and Business website this year as a model of what can be achieved through an online career program. Solomon also emphasized the benefits of creating the financial aid advisory position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s so important to disperse information from a platform that is easily accessible. So I would create a position within A.S. who would know everything about financial aid and be able to talk to students during office hours about information they heard from the Office of Financial Aid,” Solomon said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their third goal, creating an A.S. alert system, would be a way to further communication between A.S. and the student body. Solomon described the project as an opt-in system, where students can sign up to receive notifications related to what A.S. is working on and other opportunities like conferences or grants that students can apply for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also emphasized increased technological use through her plan of a new A.S. app which would give information about events and resources provided by A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is really important because I feel like A.S. this year had a really big lack of outreach. A lot of people don’t know about the resources of A.S. and people don’t even know what A.S. is or what Senate is. I think this A.S. app will really provide that and help get people involved and understand the resources they have on this campus,” Sir added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the app, Sir hopes to create a meal vending machine for low-income and undocumented students, which would be located near the Pardall Center in Isla Vista. She also wants to allocate funding to give students free access to Headspace, an app focused on improving mental health through guided meditation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir emphasized that the app and vending machine would not add additional student fees and hopes to decrease student fees as A.S. President. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon noted that they would not increase student fees but doesn’t plan to lower student fees, emphasizing the importance of the fees for creating programs that benefit students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As the chair of Finance and Business, I was able to see all the programs that were able to be put on by the fact that we do pay student fees. I would like re-allocate and work within how much we do currently have to make sure more of it is going back to students themselves and not university departments, and make sure that the university is held more accountable in paying for things that students need,” Solomon said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

id=\"caption-attachment-87602\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Both candidates spoke to their qualifications and experience.<em> Andrea Verdugo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves is running with the Isla Vista Party, while Sway is running with Campus United. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are the questions they were asked and a summary of their answers: </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you believe is the greatest issue facing new transfer students? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said transfer students have “a hard time acclimating into UCSB culture” and that he believes the greatest issue transfer students face has to do with registering on G.O.L.D. and keeping up with course load. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes the greatest issue facing new transfer students is the transition into the University of California system. Aceves said he hopes to reform the transfer student orientations, as he doesn’t believe the orientations currently highlight all of the resources available to transfer students. </span></p>\n<p><b>UCSB has a 91% transfer retention or graduation rate. That means that 91% of transfers either stay at UCSB or graduate after their first year. This also means that 9% of transfer students end up not attending UCSB anymore after their first year. What plans do you have to increase the transfer retention number so more transfer students end up staying at the university? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway repeated that retention rates have to do with “acclimating into the UCSB culture” and navigating through the course load at UCSB. He added that he hopes to establish a transfer student/alumni mentorship program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes that an increased amount of programs at the university-owned apartments and extending events to reach the university-owned apartments would allow the transfer student community to feel more included in the UCSB community, because that is where the transfer community primarily lives. </span></p>\n<p><b>According to the Associated Students (A.S.) Legal Code, the transfer senator must attend all Transfer Student Alliance organization meetings every quarter. Have you ever been to a meeting ran by the Transfer Student Alliance (TSA) or have you ever been to a meeting by a similar transfer-focused organization? If so, can you name one program run by this organization that you believed helped improve the transfer experience at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said he has been attending TSA meetings for the past quarter. He is also on the Transfer Graduation Committee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said he was an active member of TSA during fall quarter, and that he hosted a pep rally before a UCSB soccer game for the organization. Aceves mentioned that being a part of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) as a transfer student has helped him access resources and build community, and he believes that EOP can do the same for other transfer students. </span></p>\n<p><b>How will the two-party system of campaigning affect you when you take office? Do you believe you’ll be able to work effectively with the members of the other party or other independents? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said the two-party system is filled with “a lot of drama,” and that he likes to distance himself from that drama. He added that “everyone here definitely very deeply cares about the UCSB community and their constituents” and he hopes to continue with that sentiment if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes working with another party will not affect the platform points he is trying to push for. Aceves emphasized he is fighting for the transfer community as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><b>Many transfer senators have said that it has been intimidating coming from a junior college straight into a large university like UCSB, which has tons more people and more challenging upper-division classes. What would you do to change this culture shock and help transfers fit in better during their first quarter here? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway acknowledged the difficulty of jumping into upper-division courses right away as a transfer student and discussed the “negligence of orientation,” adding that the counseling opportunities were limited. Sway hopes to “revamp and reinvent” orientation and Gaucho FYI, a mandatory workshop that UCSB students have to take, to be more “transfer friendly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said providing transfer students with a sense of community as soon as they arrive at UCSB will help them acclimate. </span></p>\n<p><b>UCSB offers several on-campus resources that many students don’t even know about, such as the Collaborate Print Labs that offer 200 free prints a quarter. Name any on-campus resource that you believe transfer students, as a whole, could learn about and perhaps take advantage of. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway believes the Transfer Student Center is a resource the transfer student community could take advantage of. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves mentioned the ONDAS Student Center, TSA, Transfer Student Center, EOP and Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) as resources the transfer student community could take advantage of.</span></p>\n<p><b>Being a student can be extremely stressful. Students have to juggle three or more classes with all of their extracurriculars. Do you believe that we should expand mental health resources on campus at C.A.P.S.? If you do, what is your plan?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said he wants to see Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) expanded, and wants to implement a transfer-specific C.A.P.S program at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said the TSA created “a small group” that is working with transfer students and C.A.P.S. and he wants to expand on that. He did not specify further.</span></p>\n<p><b>92% of UCSB transfer students come from community colleges. Can you talk about your own transfer experience? What advice would you give to a student who’s about to go into their first year in junior college and wants to eventually transfer to UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway spoke to his experience coming from a rural community in Northern California, adding that his community college experience was difficult and isolating. His advice is to not stress too much about where you want to transfer and how you are going to do academically— instead, you should focus on “incorporating yourself into your new community and environment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said his experience has been amazing, and that he has been welcomed into many inclusive communities who want to help him succeed academically and socially. His biggest piece of advice to prospective students is that asking for help isn’t bad, because there are many people on campus who want to help. </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think about the class sign-up process on G.O.L.D.? In the past, students have recommended a shopping cart on G.O.L.D. where students can favorite classes that they want to take before their pass time. Do you believe that G.O.L.D. is currently a convenient way to choose your classes or could it be better? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said that navigating G.O.L.D. as a transfer student is difficult and believes that G.O.L.D. should be “reorganized to be more streamlined and better oriented for new users.” He believes  the waitlist process should be reformed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves also said navigating G.O.L.D. is challenging, and he believes Gaucho Transfer Fridays and transfer orientations could be reformed to further help transfer students navigate G.O.L.D. He added that workshops could also be implemented. </span></p>\n<p><b>Many transfer students say that they have trouble finding advisors to help guide them through the first quarter at college. Do you believe that increased advising services would improve the transfer experience? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway believes that “incorporating counseling services into Gaucho FYI” as well as re-organizing orientation to highlight counseling resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes in expanding advising, but he emphasized that in order to address the needs of the transfer community, advising cannot only be available on campus. He mentioned working with Resident Assistants to allow advisors to promote services to transfer students. </span></p>\n<p><b>3,000 visitors come to UCSB’s Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity each year. How do you plan to advocate for and uplift the voices of LGBTQ students? What will you do to contribute to making UCSB a space where LGBTQ students feel safe in their communities?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said that while he is not a part of the “LGBQT community,” he is “more than willing and able to listen to any of their concerns” and “would love to advocate for them on their behalf.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes in being an ally to the LGBTQ community and in “allowing for spaces that are inclusive to everyone no matter how you choose to identify.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Given that UCSB is ranked as the No. 5 public school and the biggest thing in our way from achieving a higher ranking is our “party school reputation,” how do you plan on curtailing our party school reputation and have us better recognized as a school focused on academics for prospective students in California and for out-of-state/international/transfer students?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said one of the most enjoyable things for him has been “the amount of options every given day on what to do… not only is the school [recognized] as a party school, but we are ranked now [in the] top five in public universities and I believe that’s a great thing, because not only are the people able to party hard, but they’re also able to play hard too.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said “a way to move away from this whole ‘UCSB is a party school’” is by “exposing ourselves to environments that are…challenging us academically, like attending conferences… I think that’s a big one, just being there and showing that our university is pushing and we are academically competitive and we’re pushing for new breakthroughs.”</span></p>\n<p><b>What would your first line of action be if you are elected? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway hopes to advocate for community composting at UCSB by working with the Isla Vista Compost Collective, A.S. Recycling and existing community gardens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves, once again, emphasized that he wants to reform transfer orientations to highlight resources for transfer students.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

Senate. It seems Solomon has a resolution on the table nearly every week, if not every other week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir drafted three resolutions during her entire term as a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon cited their primary reason for running is because they genuinely wanted to help students, and because, having been engaged in so many spaces on campus, they understand what students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon firmly believes in the term “trickle-up social justice,” which they explained as helping the most marginalized, vulnerable people on campus: “the people who have their voices silenced the most.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Solomon’s resume sprawls all over campus – they have worked in Ortega Dining Commons, the Davidson Library, the UCen Bookstore, the A.S. Cashiers and Ticket Office and beyond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, their most prominent role came in being the A.S. Finance and Business Chair, during which they kept track of nearly $15 million dollars in student fees while also holding an unwavering commitment to transparency through weekly graphics that showed students exactly where student fees go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has also reached outside of the senatorial role to organize the Trans Joy Take Over, a survivor solidarity event, and worked hard to promote the A.S. Book Bank in order to help students who may otherwise not be able to afford textbooks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen so many aspects of student life, I feel like that makes me very equipped and qualified,” they said in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kept telling students this year, this is your money. A.S. needs to be less of an elitist thing, it takes work from people within it to share with people out of it and people who don’t know very much about it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their proudest moment as senator came when they drafted a resolution supporting the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\">Black Student Union Demands</a> and were able to see the tangible change being made for Black students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a senatorial candidate in Spring Quarter 2018, Solomon centered their platform on mental health education, pushing for decreased wait times at Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this goal was not nearly unique at the time, Solomon won the most “first” votes out of any other on-campus senator during the Spring Quarter 2018 elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have further solidified relationships with UCSB administration, working with Vice Chancellor for Students Affairs Margaret Klawunn to lower the fee waiver for students who have been charged in the College Alcohol and Substance Education (C.A.S.E.) program, as well as supporting former A.S. Advisor LaDonte King’s legacy by creating the “King’s A+ For Excellence”  scholarship in his name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon said they had to work hard to get that fee lowered. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really had to show them that I’m not just a student who enjoys drinking and wants people to not get charged for that. It’s a serious issue… students were put in really bad financial situations because of the C.A.S.E. fee and sometimes it was just because they were caught with alcohol in a dorm or just very minor things when the real issue is actually binge drinking.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon also has a self-described “working relationship” with the Office of Financial Aid, putting on workshops with them and becoming familiar with the department’s director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They further spoke to their attendance of conferences, noting they have a “really good network” at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. They have learned from those campuses and their student governments with the aim of making UC Santa Barbara’s A.S. better. </span></p>\n<p><b>GOALS IF ELECTED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It appears Solomon has not forgotten the C.A.P.S. goal that they ran on as a senatorial candidate, as Solomon noted in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that, if elected, they want to continue to push for more funding for C.A.P.S., along with a dozen other agenda items, which include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting the Black Student Union Demands;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working to make textbooks more affordable; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating UC-wide coalitions between student activists and student leaders; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pushing the UC President, Janet Napolitano, to make sure students’ voices are heard; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a peer mentor program with the Office of the President, in which students would be more informed about their financial aid and advising options;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing to put out surveys to gauge students’ needs;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding the A.S.

We were disappointed when Solomon did not fully respond to our question about the tweet and a question about a judicial council case they were involved in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They did, however, admit that the tweet was a “momentary lapse” in judgement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Solomon said they would not use their private social media accounts for A.S. and political business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second point of concern with Solomon’s candidacy – and one that gave the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pause when discussing endorsements – was the fact that they deceived the student body during Fall Quarter 2018 by not living amongst their constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During their interview with the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Solomon admitted to living off campus during Fall Quarter 2018, a possible violation of their term as an on-campus senator – an offense that fellow On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\">removed from her position for</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They spoke candidly about their situation, citing financial struggles as the reason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the beginning of the year and throughout the summer, I could not afford to live anywhere. So I didn’t have a lease… anywhere fall quarter,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon added that they did tell Internal Vice President Steven Ho about the situation; however, the fact remains that their constituents did not know. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was living with a friend until I could afford to pay for winter and spring [quarters]. And I’m in a pretty bad place financially. I was trying to save up money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon said the reason they didn’t speak about the issue publicly at the time is because they did not want “the additional burden” that came with the publicity that Salari had experienced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> acknowledges that Solomon’s deception was troubling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, given Solomon’s ability to be candid and open with us now, combined with the financial hardships that they had faced, we do not believe this should affect the student body’s decision on who to choose as the president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus’ </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specific concerns, we fully recognize Solomon’s cracks as a candidate are far and few compared to their successes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has created change in every corner of this campus. Even those not involved in A.S. circles – which are admittedly rather insulated – know Solomon as someone who has accomplished a lot in their short time at UCSB, a fact the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found as we were deciding who to endorse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon is a current second year, and while we realize that having a third-year A.S. president is a bit unorthodox, they appear to be naturally suited for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are open about their struggles and their qualifications, and aren’t afraid to take on the realities of the job – they noted that their identity as a queer, Black person helps them to understand the struggle of all students, particularly marginalized ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview, Solomon put it aptly: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most marginalized people [on campus] experience all the bugs in a system, like all the things going wrong with the association or the university… We’re able to feel it the most and then we’re able to advocate for them and make this university better in a way that benefits every single student on this campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As echoed before, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that either Solomon or Sir would serve the school well; no matter who takes home a victory on the night of April 25, our school will be in good hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the fact remains: our choice is Solomon – we have faith in them to not only do the job required if elected, but to also go above and beyond to advocate for UCSB students at every possible level. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team.</span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the April 18, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

She started off as a fellow her first year, went on to work as the community organizing director and is currently the legislative director in the office.</p>\n<p>She knows the EVPSA office inside out — she knows how to get things done and exactly who to work with to make things happen.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has spent the last three years working behind the scenes, and it’s time for her to be in the spotlight.</p>\n<p>“I think the EVPSA is a very unique position in which it’s not something that you can just come into and know what you’re doing,” Leal Silva said. “There are so many institutions that you’re navigating, so many relationships that have to be formed. Frankly, they get the work done and I think I’ve really put in the groundwork to allow myself to do that work.”</p>\n<p>“I know what a successful office looks like versus one that needs more work. I have worked in every single office that has existed on this campus for the past three years.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has ample experience working with Associated Students (A.S.) Lobby Corps; this past year, she has been working on Senate Bill 24, a bill which would ensure abortion by medication access on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Last year, Leal Silva helped create Coffee and Calls, which provided students with the opportunity to call their senators about certain legislation while having a free cup of coffee in the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> asked Leal Silva why she decided to stay working behind the scenes for so long, and her answer further confirmed that she is now ready to take on the position.</p>\n<p>“I am a big believer in taking space and leaving space and knowing when to step up and knowing when to take a step back and just do the work,” Leal Silva said. “I’m not ashamed to admit that I wouldn’t have been able to serve our students as well last year.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva made it clear that she will not be affected by any of the drama or toxicity that comes with party politics in A.S.</p>\n<p>“The EVPSA office is such a unique space. It’s one space that, personally, I’ve never seen become enthralled with the drama that sometimes can enthrall A.S.,” she said. “It’s not the sense of superiority or like ‘we’re above it,’ but it’s this sense of knowing… we’re working for something so big, we’re working for ideas that seem so unattainable.”</p>\n<p>“There isn’t time to get caught up in all of it.”</p>\n<p>For the first two years of Leal Silva working in the EVPSA office, the office was “CU-controlled.”</p>\n<p>“For me, it comes down to: Are you down to do the work?” Leal Silva said.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, the boy living on Picasso, the girl living on Sabado… they don’t care about your business. They don’t care about your drama, they just care about how you’re doing work that helps them.”</p>\n<p>If elected, Leal Silva hopes to focus on expanding financial aid and focus specifically on advocating for the Middle Class Scholarship.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also wants to focus on deferred maintenance funding.</p>\n<p>“We need to talk about how Girvetz is in shambles, but we have brand new bioengineering buildings,” Leal Silva said. “Our students should feel like they all have access to this equal level of education and that they’re not being left behind because of their major.”</p>\n<p>“Newsom asks that we add a thousand more students to the UC system. How could we possibly accommodate for those students if we can’t accommodate for the ones we already have?”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva’s maturity and sense of responsibility are two qualities necessary for the EVPSA position, but more than anything, Leal Silva sold the <em>Nexus</em> on her pure passion for the work she does and the goals she has for UCSB if elected into the position.</p>\n<p>“I want UCSB to be a leader of force when it comes to these issues. I want them to think of our campus as an indispensable area of innovation and of creativity and community. I think that we already have it and I think we can do more of it, and I would love to help lead us to that next step.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also referenced the Finance and Business Committee budget reports that On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon has been creating, stating she wants to take similar steps in order to be transparent with the amount of money spent on lobbying trips.</p>\n<p>“I’m very aware that the EVPSA has one of the biggest budgets in A.S. because they do work that needs, frankly, more money,” Leal Silva said. “But being intentional and being like ‘just so you know, this is what we’re doing with the [money]’… can really, I think, strengthen that bond of trust between the student body and the office.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“That’s what allyship is… It’s using your privilege to say, ‘I’m going to step aside and give you my stage for however long you need it to get your point across.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of what the EVPSA office has done to increase transparency during the time Leal Silva has worked in it, Leal Silva said she believes the social media presence of the office has grown over the last three years in order to keep students in the loop, and she hopes the office’s social media presence will continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also showed that she knows exactly who to work with within A.S. for the projects she wants to take on.</p>\n<p>She talked about funding to address food insecurity in I.V., and said she would work with the Executive Vice President for Local Affairs and the A.S. Food Bank. She discussed addressing the holes in Title IX policy, and said she would work with C.A.R.E. and Take Back the Night. Leal Silva also mentioned working with the Human Rights Board to advocate for gun violence legislation.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva is also knowledgeable about UCSB’s role in the United States Students Association (USSA) and the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<p>“UCSB pays the most dues to the UCSA, which means that when we’re talking about issues, they need to listen to our campus because we’re paying the most money.”</p>\n<p>“I think the money that we do put forth is doing tangible good. It is doing really great things in terms of supporting the undocumented community, in terms of supporting sustainable programs, and in terms of funding the UC,” she added. “As EVPSA, I want to make sure that those benefits are being felt on our campus.”</p>\n<p>This past year, Leal Silva has been serving on the Government Relations Committee of UCSA, which includes the legislative directors of other UCs; Leal Silva has effectively built connections with other UC EVPSA offices already.</p>\n<p>“I’ve learned a lot from listening to how Berkeley runs their office, to San Diego, to Santa Cruz, and they all have such critical ways of approaching these issues,” Leal Silva said. “I almost don’t want to compare them because I don’t want the space to feel like a race or like a competition.</p>\n<p>“It very much so should exist as a collaborative space where you’re learning from each other.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also seems committed to doing whatever it takes to help marginalized students on campus and added that she wants to continue to advocate for UCSA’s Undocumented Student’s Lobby Day.</p>\n<p>“That’s what allyship is… It’s using your privilege to say, ‘I’m going to step aside and give you my stage for however long you need it to get your point across.’”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also believes that it wouldn’t be her constituents’ jobs to come to her, but instead, it would be her job to go to them.</p>\n<p>“If you want to know what’s affecting students in the [Muslim Student Association], you have to go to an MSA meeting and sit down and listen. You want to understand what’s affecting students in Indus or MEChA or even CLAS.… go to CLAS and ask the tutors ‘what are you witnessing?’”</p>\n<p>“Go to a C.A.P.S. psychologist [and ask] ‘What services would help you do your job better?’ It’s all very worth it if you want to understand where students are at.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> does believe that Beasley is a capable leader. He is the director of internal affairs for the Coalition for a Better UC (CBUC), and he spoke to the work he has done on one of the CBUC’s goals to expand the Cal Grant.</p>\n<p>Beasley has refreshing ideas. He wants to help stop the UC from doing business with corporations that profit off of prison labor and support formerly incarcerated young adults who apply to UCSB, along with his more common platform point of decreasing the burden of tuition for UC students.</p>\n<p>When asked why he decided to run this year, Beasley said, “I figured it was, you know, prime time because I’ll be going into my third year. I don’t want to do it while I’d be studying abroad my senior year.”</p>\n<p>“I figured if I were to run this quarter, then my term would start while we were still doing the hearings for the bill, so I’d be able to use the resources from the office to be able to try to push this bill and push student issues as a whole.”</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus</em> admires Beasley’s work on the Summer Cal Grant bill, we are concerned that this one bill will end up being his primary focus.</p>\n<p>“I know that he has done a lot of work regarding Cal Grants and financial aid,” Leal Silva said when asked about her opponent.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot to be considered and it can’t be just that.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva added that she’s had the “privilege of working with him and working with his group on the Cal Grant,” and that she believes he is doing “incredible work.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva said that Beasley is “an example of what student leadership is and of what boots-on-the-ground work is,” and she wants to continue to collaborate with Beasley.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has the broad knowledge of issues that are required of the EVPSA to know about, and we do not believe that Beasley has the insight or experience that Leal Silva has.</p>\n<p>When Leal Silva was a first year at UCSB, she applied to a lobbying trip and did not get in. Leal Silva spoke to how disappointed she felt, and she mentioned how the legislative director in the EVPSA office at the time told her that she had to make herself “indispensable” on this campus.</p>\n<p>“[He said] ‘you need to be one of the people that if we’re talking about Title IX, or if we’re talking about financial aid, we think of you automatically as someone we need to have on our team.’”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has done just that — she has become indispensable on this campus.</p>\n<p>“We have so much potential,” Leal Silva said toward the end of her interview. “If chosen to serve, I would give it everything I had and more.”</p>\n<p>We believe her.</p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus<em> Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87560\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87560\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/","id":2090,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2089,2088,2087],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Alli Adam for Internal Vice President","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/allia_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-8.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/allia_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-8.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Daily Nexus endorses Alli Adam to be the 2019-2020 internal vice president of the 70th A.S.

Senate was led by IVP Steven Ho. Although Ho did make an effort to keep his Senate under tabs, multiple instances of disorder showcased in Senate meetings were ultimately left unmediated by Ho, who is responsible for being both diplomatic and bipartisan in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> believes Alli Adam will better equipped to handle unruly situations and facilitate Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Adam served as a Letters and Sciences senator where she learned that the common goal of A.S. – to help the student body as a whole – often gets lost in “pettiness on the Senate floor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to run for internal vice president to access the full potential and legitimacy that the Senate could have,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam plans to crack down on the use of technology during public forum, which is an area that she believes Ho did not spend enough effort to enforce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam finds the current penalty for technology use, docking honoraria, to be ineffective, noting that most senators breach the policy and use technology anyways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To remediate this problem, Adam plans to have senators “put their phone next to their name tags,” where they will be much more visible to the public, other senators and the IVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam proposed this idea because she finds that senators “aren’t as attentive” as they should be, despite the importance of public forum, when “members of our community and our campus come to talk to who they believe is to be representing them and responsive to their needs and responsive to their concerns.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further uphold a healthy environment at Senate meetings, Adam said she will have “no problem kicking people out of public forum if they are inappropriate… I can’t have my senators feeling like they’re unsafe when somebody’s coming in for public forums.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When questioned about her qualifications for the position, Adam cited her experience in mock trial, public speaking, her work in the office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs, an internship at the Alumni Association  and her work in Senate this past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Adam’s public forum resolution didn’t “pan out” the way she wanted it to, she stands behind it because it provides students a concrete and guaranteed time to speak at public forum. The resolution was created in order to hold public forum at a set time, before the “new business” section of the Senate agenda. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of her resolution, Adam also provided students with a “campus-wide school supply drive,” where she was “able to save the time and money of over 500 students during Week One.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of personal qualities, Adam said she will take advantage of her assertiveness and confidence to help keep order and set precedent at Senate meetings.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m confident and unafraid to have order in the Senate room because I think the lack of order and the lack of control has let us senators think we can do whatever we want,” Adam said. “We all need to be on the same page and we all need to have a consistent behavior so that we’re cohesive and we’re productive.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when asked about an instance where she was able to display her assertiveness, Adam was not able to list any tangible examples, citing the “toxic” and “disheartening” atmosphere at Senate meetings where she felt “honest opinions aren’t valued.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a larger scale, the role of IVP requires whoever is filling the seat to remain neutral, unbiased and bipartisan. Adam has run with Campus United, one of the two A.S parties, for both her Senate and executive campaigns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When questioned about her bipartisanship, Adam pledged that, even in the event all other executives are members of the Isla Vista Party, “I am 100% committed to being a neutral and unbiased IVP.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes that “drive” and “determination” are much stronger metrics of qualification than party affiliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes working with other executives is “about setting clear goals and clear standards so that we can refer back to them when things do get tricky.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked to critique the current IVP, Adam cited multiple grievances with Ho throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam is chiefly concerned with the timeliness of training, which educates incoming senators on the various parts of A.S. According to Adam, no formal training occurred until Winter Quarter, two quarters after elections concluded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of felt like our first half of Senate was whether or not you had an in with Steven and you could be his friend enough to get the information,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honoraria, another aspect that Adam holds frustration with, failed to be distributed in a timely manner this year. Honoraria is sometimes used for “basic needs,” according to Adam, when students rely on its timeliness to make payments. To combat this, Adam pledges to ensure that honoraria will be paid on time at the end of each quarter, as well as to post honoraria links so necessary BCUs (Boards, Committees and Units) can receive their funding as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam’s final grievance with Ho’s tenure rests in his oversight of the Senate as a whole. Adam said Ho let senators “run amok” during Senate meetings, which hindered the Senate’s ability to have productive meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho’s poor control of Senate resulted in “a lack of change being made for students,” Adam said, as well as “a lack of legislation because certain senators feel like if they introduce something, it’s going to be like verbally scoffed at.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Adam is working with another senator, Melissa Perez, to create an alternative method for members of A.S. to interact with students, as she finds that the default settings of Senate meetings are often “toxic” and “intense,” which can deter students from sharing their ideas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether it’s on FaceTime, whether it’s an anonymous email or an anonymous comment, we’re going to have a list that we want to get back out to the students so that they know how they can still contact us if they don’t feel comfortable in the room,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also room for improvement in how senators manage BCUs. Adam feels that senators need to do a better job listening to BCUs needs, as it is a senator’s job to be a liaison between their respective BCU and the Senate itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Adam suggested that she will ask future senators to “personalize” relationships with their respective BCU, so they can better tune in to each BCU’s specific need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For me, it comes down to personalizing and, as a senator, how you’re going to work with your BCU,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To maintain transparency within the Senate, Adam proposed the idea of holding one-on-one meetings with each senator every quarter. By doing so, the meetings will allow her to maintain “a clear line of communication” among the entire Senate and help answer any questions senators have by pointing them in the right direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At every Senate meeting, there is an allocated spot on the agenda for specific on-campus organizations to deliver an update. However, there is almost never a physical presence. Adam plans to “hunt down” these representatives because hearing from them “really helps senators know what those spaces are up to,” as well as “build trust in senators so they can go and collaborate with those people on certain issues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next year, if elected, Adam would like to have more oversight of Finance and Business, the IVP’s administrative committee and have a Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.)  counselor present at every Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also expressed her frustration in the lack of resources for students to store their belongings at the end of Spring Quarter. Currently, students can take their belongings home, pay a fee to keep it in a storage locker or move into their new residence two weeks after finals end. Adam would like to create an interim storage solution to allow students to store their belongings as they shift between leases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Adam would also like to incorporate more funding to “prioritize mental health” without raising student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Adam has not demonstrated as much tangible change in Senate as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would like to see. But we do believe that, coupled with her ideas to improve the role of IVP, her work outside of Senate and her drive to make A.S. a better entity, Adam is an effective, bipartisan and diplomatic candidate for the role of internal vice president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, we believe she has the maturity and confidence to facilitate Wednesday night A.S. Senate meetings effectively. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87552\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87552\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/","id":2089,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2088,2087,2086],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Advocate General: No Endorsement","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/andrewn_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/andrewn_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus decided not to endorse a candidate for the S.A.G. position.

It has been shortened and lightly edited for clarity:</p>\n<p><strong>What is your name, year and major?</strong><br>\nI am a second year English major and history minor.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are you running for S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI didn’t anticipate running for an exec position…. I thought that because I served as a senator as an off-campus Senator this year, I would retire after this year, but I figured I still had some gas in the tank and there was still a lot of work left to be done in our community. I figured it would almost be like a sell out move to just retire a little bit earlier than ahead of time.</p>\n<p><strong>What party did you run with as senator? Do you think parties should exist?</strong><br>\nIf you asked me a couple of months ago, I would say [parties] would be completely unnecessary. Now, looking back [on this] year as a whole, I think parties offer some value. I think it’s kept other senators accountable because there is this sense of competitiveness. But as a whole, I think [it has caused] a lot more friction in the organization then it needs to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Because you were involved in Campus United, are you worried that people might not think that you’re independent if you do get the position?</strong><br>\nI’m going to try to brand myself as completely unaffiliated as much as I can. But of course, no matter what you say or how much you do, there’s still people who will cast you one way or another…</p>\n<p>I thrive best in one-on-one situations, on individual scenarios, right. So even in the Senate room, I’ve tried throughout the entire year to cross the aisle per se. I love working with IVP senators. I try to cooperate and collaborate them as much as I can.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you involved with on campus that you believe makes you qualified for S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI worked for the annual fund and as student ambassadors. So even working with a bunch of those people, you’re talking to all different parts of the campus. Other than that I’m also in the Zeta Psi fraternity. So I’m involved in the Greek community, which constitutes about 10% of our campus. [I am also in] mock trial. I did [mock trial] my freshman year and I still serve as a student coach. And so all of those organizations I think touches on these different corners of our campus. Honestly, I’m just one person and I’d love to be involved as much as I can, but I can’t [be involved in everything].</p>\n<p><strong>You are involved in Greek Life. You will most likely be dealing with a lot of cases and maybe even some against members of Greek Life. Do you feel there’s any sort of conflict of interest here, and what can you do to ease the concerns of the students on campus who don’t feel safe around Greek Life?</strong><br>\nI think my involvement in the Greek Life community actually offered me a really unique perspective. I think I could actually approach those sort of cases with less prejudice because it’s well known that there’s a stigma around a Greek life. Right? And I think that’s where a lot of biases against people that comes about. But having been in Greek life myself, I can see that there are really awesome people in Greek life. I met some of the best people I’ve ever met in my life [in Greek life]. I think [being in Greek life] allows me to approach these sort of cases, along with other communities I’m involved in, in a way that is a more compassionate than someone that isn’t.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important aspect of being S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI think making the resources [that are] more accessible. I know a large part of the job is to represent the students interests in terms of disciplinary action. That was definitely a large part of the job. But for me and going into this election season, I really want to emphasize my passion for making a lot of the resources on campus more accessible, [because] at least from my experience, a large part of these resources exist in the first place is because it became clear that a lot of students need things like the Food Bank, but [some students] don’t know that these resources exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific projects that you’re interested in working on while S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI was talking to Jack Tannenbaum [Editor’s Note: Tannenbaum was the 2017-2018 S.A.G.] who was working on [a poll project] throughout the entire year. It was to collect data from the student body, especially from people who aren’t involved in A.S. through the outreach.</p>\n<p>I would love to take on that project, but to build upon it. Tabling, going door to door and through basic face interactions to get students actually really thinking about this thing critically. So [I want to] collect that data and then bring it to the Senate and then say, ‘That this is what the student prioritize.’ I think that is the best way to first determine what the students want. And then from there working with my team to figure out how to make those resources more visible. I can’t do this [alone] obviously. But to work with the cabinet, along with the 24 senators that are about to get elected, I think we do some real damage.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you look for in hiring caseworkers, in members of your office? What are some qualities you’d look for?</strong><br>\nThis is arguably thing I thought about most… I’m really looking forward [to working with a team] and my team will have eagerness and a passion for [the office]. I’m looking for people who will approach these cases with a sense of humanity and compassion that I think the OSA requires a level of empathy that I think students deserve. So that’s the thing I’m really looking for, goodhearted people who care, but [also] have this really special level of compassion for others.</p>\n<p><strong>Example: Say there is an incident where someone says that you are not doing your job correctly. How would you respond to that?</strong><br>\nListen to them, for starters. I think from my experience as a senator and [from] my leadership experience in high school, it’s much harder to sit down and listen to what someone has to say to you, especially when it’s not convenient. So that’s the first thing I’d do. I would listen and see where they’re coming from and then work with them to see how we can better.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have experience working with people in the administration? People like Katya Armistead, Margaret Klawunn, etc.?</strong><br>\nNo, I don’t actually. So a lot of this will be new and a lot of it is very daunting. But the team that I’m hoping to create, I am looking for people who were experienced in working with those sorts of figures. So, I mean, a lot of what you just said seemed daunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you’re prepared for this position?</strong><br>\nI mean, I’m here right now. I think so. I’m hopeful more than I am [prepared]. I am frightened, but I am a human being, so a lot of nights I do stay up thinking about it to see if I’m ready. But I think a large part of me, like I said, is really excited, but [there is] that part that is scared. I think I even find value in that.</p>\n<p>I think it means I’m not stupid. I am trying to be really delicate and really critical about the things I say. I understand the gravity of this position.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you uphold that confidentiality?</strong><br>\nI think the major thing is to emphasize [confidentiality] with my case workers because they’re the ones that are also seeing the case. And for me personally, I’ve dealt with confidentiality. Just being a senator, we have to uphold confidentiality with, especially with Title IX reports.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think can be most improved around campus?</strong><br>\nI think the major thing I’m focused on is the visibility and access to resources. [Hearing] from my friends and my constituents as the senator right now, people just don’t know they exist. That would be the thing that would be most improved. Like I said, just highlighting those sort of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal Code states that the S.A.G. is expected to “Educate the student body about student’s rights, University and Associated Students policies, laws, regulations, procedures, and promote awareness of the availability of support and assistance services offered both by the OSA, Associated Students, and the University at large.” How would you go about doing that?</strong><br>\nYeah, so I know workshops are also very good way to go about that. I think a lot of students are interested in the rights that they have. I think once I have been making myself visible and I have a good amount of influence on the community at large, I think pushing these workshops that educate people on their student rights [would] be really helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think your personal identity intersects with your professional duty to represent students, especially those of historically underrepresented communities? How do you think your identity will play a role in your position as S.A.G. if elected?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m a second generation American. My parents migrated over to America in 1979 and so growing up, I have definitely been somebody who has experienced and been exposed to a lot of <em>microaggressions.</em> Absolutely. But to say that I have been largely marginalized and I think would be to invalidate the narratives of so many other people. I don’t plan on casting myself as someone by a marginalized narrative, but I do have a sense of what that feels to be a second generation American.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you go about choosing your team?</strong><br>\nSo I would send out an application. An online application that asks what organizations they’re part of. That’s major, that very basic stuff. Right. And then once they come to interview, I kind of have to ask them, um, [a lot of] sorts of questions. Quite honestly, [I want] just to see different personalities in work.</p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus<em> Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news

id=\"caption-attachment-87556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that is not to say that Griffin’s endorsement is a complete stamp of approval: both candidates had significant advantages and weaknesses that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> took into consideration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Griffin received the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> endorsement because of the work he has done, the familiarity he has with local government bodies and officials as well as his platform, which had more concrete ideas that could go a long way for the community if implemented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin runs for this position after having worked in the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) office since his freshman year, when he applied for the fellowship program within the office. That year, Griffin worked with then EVPLA Ashcon Minoiefar to find homes for students who were displaced due to a balcony collapse in a home on Del Playa Drive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That same year, Griffin also served as the treasurer for Hall Council in Santa Cruz Hall. Griffin noted in his interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Santa Cruz Hall was the only residence hall that year to not ask for additional funds from Residential Housing Association at the end of the year. He cited this as evidence of his fiscal responsibility, which he said he would apply to the EVPLA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that it’s important that people who are in those positions are responsible with student fees. And that’s an example of me being responsible as student fees,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following year, Griffin served as the I.V. liaison for the office and began working with different groups in I.V. and familiarizing himself with the arena of local politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Griffin studied abroad in Fall Quarter. When he came back to UCSB, he did not serve in an Associated Students role on campus, but was involved with the Beloved Community Conference Committee and served as president of the UC Santa Barbara chapter of The One Campaign, an international organization taking action against poverty and preventable disease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, for his senior year, Griffin believes it is the right time for him to step into the position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought that I would come back [from studying abroad] and do what I’ve always wanted to do and be the EVPLA,” Griffin said. “Or at least give myself the chance to run and share my story with students and share why I think I would be the best candidate to represent students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for his platform, Griffin has already made efforts to ensure the feasibility and completion of some of his projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin discussed the possibility of a community court in I.V. with local representatives Joan Hartmann and District Attorney Joyce Dudley, who he said were in favor of implementing the plan in the next year. The court would allow I.V. residents to attend hearings for minor infractions, such as underage drinking and parking violations, at a location in I.V. rather than at the courthouse in downtown Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the circumstances of many students in I.V., such as busy schedules and a lack of transportation, the option to attend hearings locally would lift a weight off students’ shoulders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most [students] don’t have cars and yes, there is a bus that goes down there, but most of these court dates are Friday at 8:00 a.m. and sometimes the buses are too full or sometimes [students] can’t get to the bus on time,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is also aiming for a project that has long been an unfulfilled aspect of previous EVPLA platforms: free wifi in parks and beaches in I.V. Although the project has failed to gain footing in the past, Griffin believes completing the project is just a matter of “laying the groundwork.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a project that can’t be completed in nine months. It can be started in nine months, but then there’s lack of continuity in that transition. So I think that now, given the fact that we have structured government in Isla Vista… pushing for it and continuing to lay the groundwork for [the parks] can have it go throughout the next few years,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address food insecurity, Griffin wants to create a food bank in I.V. by collaborating with local grocery stores to give away the food those stores don’t sell. Griffin said after meeting with someone from the I.V. Food Co-op, he believes stores would be willing to donate food that is close to expiring so that students can access it for free at a designated location in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite his thorough platform ideas, which the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> believes will benefit students if they are seen through, Griffin still seems to be slightly out of touch with student issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Griffin must ensure that groups which he cannot speak for are able and encouraged to speak and express their own concerns, grievances and hopes for the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I cannot speak on behalf of all communities and identities in Isla Vista and UCSB’s campus, but I really like marketing Associated Students and I think that if the EVPLA Office and A.S. as a whole can work to market our services and market what we do as an entity, I think that that gives a little bit more outreach to those communities,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible for Griffin to amplify these voices in his office, but it will be up to him to provide that opportunity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also failed to adequately address sexual assault, violence and harassment in his platform and interview. As something that has consistent advocacy from student organizations, UCSB’s Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education Center and I.V.’s local governments, sexual violence in I.V. and at UCSB is an issue that needs to be on the EVPLA’s radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When discussing police presence in I.V., another contested issue in the community, Griffin again seemed to lack the perspective that some students hold about feeling unsafe with police. Griffin said he wants to “bridge the gap” between students and police, namely by holding public forums to foster discussions between the two and “really working to give more of a backstory of the police officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had concerns that Griffin somewhat overlooked the serious worries of students who do not feel safe around police officers. Griffin offered some ideas to address the issue, but seemed to think that issue could be solved if students “understand who [police officers] are in general.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, in comparison with Ornelas, Griffin lacked the same charisma and confidence that his opponent displayed. Student leaders –– all leaders –– need to be able to inspire hope, assurance and trust in their constituents. Neither EVPLA candidates completely achieved this, but Ornelas’ personable character is an advantage he has over Griffin.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Griffin will need to keep these concerns at the forefront of his agenda as EVPLA and if he does, there is potential for a successful EVPLA term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, neither candidate perfectly embodies the ideal candidate for this position. Although Ornelas might be more personable with constituents, his platform projects fell short of Griffin’s, and lacked concrete plans for execution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas listed some of his proposals for his term as creating a monthly farmer’s market in I.V. and special topic classes co-taught by professors and students. These ideas are not bad, but they’re not the most pressing needs of students at the moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas seemed to have a better sense of student opinions’ on issues like police presence and sexual violence, but had little understanding of government agencies in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes Griffin will use his position as EVPLA to fulfill his platform and serve students to his best ability.
