As the officer walked the subject to his patrol vehicle, the belligerent bronco began yelling incoherent words.</p>\n<p>He then got angry with the officer, who he accused of ruining his “stunt” while he was “trying to impress the chicks.”</p>\n<p>Saving the man from any woman who would fall for such bravado, the cowboy was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>No Freebies at Freebirds!<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 6, 2:30 a.m. – Officers walking along Embarcadero del Norte overheard what sounded like a fight.</p>\n<p>Upon further investigation, the deputy determined that a Freebirds employee was detaining a 20-year-old man who was attempting to break out with an unpaid-for burrito in tow.</p>\n<p>The officer detained the subject, who reeked of alcohol and whose eyes were bloodshot and watery. The man was unable to maintain balance, and officers had to restrain him to prevent him from falling over.</p>\n<p>The burrito burglar was then arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Hell Hath No Fury Like a (Drunk) Woman Scorned<br>\nFriday, Oct. 5, 11:00 p.m. – An officer standing on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive observed a woman staggering down the sidewalk by herself.</p>\n<p>As the deputy approached to check on her welfare, the 18-year-old woman yelled, “I hate you, get away from me.”</p>\n<p>The officer identified himself and said he was only trying to help her before asking the woman what was wrong.</p>\n<p>The subject told him that she was having the “worst day of [her] life” because her boyfriend had just broken up with her.</p>\n<p>When he asked her where she was going, the woman said she was headed home to 989 Abrego Rd., a non-existent address. He then asked her how much alcohol she had consumed, and she said “none,” despite exhibiting several signs of intoxication.</p>\n<p>When asked what year she was born, the heartbroken honey replied, “1929.”</p>\n<p>Because the woman had no friends to look after her, the deputy decided to arrest her for her own safety.</p>\n<p>During booking, the woman repeatedly lied about her age and expressed her distaste for the IVFP officers, saying “I am 19. I fucking hate you guys… I hate you, leave me alone.”</p>\n<p>As the woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, she would switch between crying uncontrollably to yelling and acting belligerent. For the safety of other detainees, she was placed in her own cell.</p>\n<p>Whiskey Bent and Jail Bound<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 6, 12:19 a.m. – An officer patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive noticed a 21-year-old man stumbling in the way of oncoming traffic.</p>\n<p>When contacted, the swaggering subject was mumbling incoherently and was unable to answer simple questions.</p>\n<p>Eventually he said to the deputy, “I’m drunk, you can arrest me if you want.”</p>\n<p>The officer obliged, but was unaware that the easy arrest would become such a hassle. During transport, the subject began vomiting, which continued all the way to the IVFP office.</p>\n<p>During booking, the man was unable to walk on his own, unable to focus his eyes and gave conflicting information about his identity, confusing his phone and social security numbers.</p>\n<p> The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14661\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14661\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/","id":3884,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[3883,3882,3881],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"And You May Find Yourself Sleeping on a Sidewalk\nSaturday, Sept. 29, 2:15 a.m. - Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Estero Road came upon an 18-year-old man snoring on the sidewalk.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>And You May Find Yourself Sleeping on a Sidewalk<br>\nSaturday, Sept. 29, 2:15 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Estero Road came upon an 18-year-old man snoring on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>A deputy attempted to contact the man, but the sleeping subject was unresponsive to his directions.</p>\n<p>The officer – who may have gone to masseuse school before becoming a policeman – awoke the man by performing a sternum rub. The subject was extremely confused, and asked himself out loud, “Where am I? Well, how did I get here?”</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked how much the man had to drink, the subject sheepishly confessed, “I pissed myself and I only had two beers.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication and providing false information to a peace officer, and was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>You and the Cap’n, Make it Happen<br>\nFriday, Sept. 28, 10:47 p.m. – Residents of a house on the 6800 block of Sabado Tarde Road reported to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol that an unknown man was passed out on their deck.</p>\n<p>When officers arrived at the scene, they found the 19-year-old subject looking unkempt and detected, by his stench, that he had soiled his clothing.</p>\n<p>When the man saw the deputies, he attempted to stand, but immediately fell to the ground. The officers soon understood why.</p>\n<p>The man puffed up his chest and announced that he had taken 30 shots of Captain Morgan. Following his proud pronouncement, he tried to approach the officers to explain that he was OK, but again fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>Due to his extreme level of inebriation, the man was arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>As the man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, he vomited in the van before falling asleep in the puke-y puddle.</p>\n<p>You Say It’s Your Birthday<br>\nSunday, Sept. 30, 12:05 a.m. – Deputies contacted a 19-year-old man after they observed him disturbing a group of women walking down the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>After confirming that the man did not know the women he was attempting to hit on, the officer sent him home.</p>\n<p>The deputy watched the man walk away and noticed that he had a very unsteady gait.

They then decided to arrest him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>During questioning and booking at the I.V.

Friday, Aug. 24 marks the weekend before Santa Barbara City College starts its fall session. In response, the police force charged with keeping order in the square mile that has become infamous for its parties has upped its numbers to 16 officers on foot and several “rover” units in squad cars.</p>\n<p>At 10 p.m. the deputies and officers leave the station and break into several large groups consisting of about five men each and head toward the infamous Del Playa Drive. All conversation halts and eye contact is avoided as students pass by the officers. Partiers on the decks of houses above can be heard muttering, “Uh oh, there’s the police, what time is it?” in a bid to avoid a ticket for violating Santa Barbara County’s midnight noise curfew.</p>\n<p>Ninety percent of all crime in I.V. is alcohol-related. Fear, however, is not necessary according to IVFP deputy Isaiah Tchobanoff. He said if you just follow the rules you can have both a social life and a clean record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Ignorance is no excuse,” Tchobanoff said. “You have responsibility as students to know the laws.”</p>\n<p><b>All of It?</b></p>\n<p>Three young men walk down the 6500 block of DP carrying two cases of beer while drinking some. They see the cops and begin speed walking, but to no avail. Tchobanoff instructs them to sit down on the curb while he begins to gather their information. One of the men does not have an ID so he tells Tchobanoff his details.</p>\n<p>At the scene, Sergeant Daniel Massey explains the consequences of these actions as he watches one sullen young man on the curb with his Coors beer.</p>\n<p>“If what he says is true then he’ll be given a ticket and sent on his way – after pouring out all the beer,” Massey said.</p>\n<p>Two of the young men are issued infractions for open containers. If the men were under 21, they would have received a minor in possession citation, which is a misdemeanor. An MIP penalty is more serious than an infraction and results in a mandatory court appearance where the judge can pick from a plethora of punishments to bestow upon the lawbreaker. These men, however, are of legal age and so they are given their tickets and instructed to pour out all of the beer.</p>\n<p>While the two are still soaking the ground with suds, another young man walks onto the street talking on his cell phone with a beer in the other hand. In a matter of seconds he is plopped down next to our current offenders crying, “Wait, I was just in there. I came out to talk on my cell phone!”</p>\n<p>Too late. Officers can issue open container citations in places with public access like the street, the sidewalk and even some driveways. The infraction carries a $108 fine.</p>\n<p>All these gentlemen could have easily avoided the tickets if they had just waited to enjoy that Rocky Mountain taste indoors.</p>\n<p><b>Dude, Where’s My Gas Cap?</b></p>\n<p>Near the end of the 6500 block of DP, officers catch a young man tampering with an Isuzu parked along the street. The man has removed the gas cap and placed it on the top of the car. An officer takes the man’s driver license and begins reviewing the information when both officers suddenly take off running to break up a potential fight down the block. The vehicular hooligan cries out to his friends standing in the shadows across the street, “Should I run? He has my ID! Should I run?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!” cheer his friends but just as the young man leans forward to run, the officers return, none too happy upon observing his attempt of flight. The owner of the Isuzu is retrieved from the house behind, briefed of the situation and asked if he would like to press charges. The irate Isuzu driver enthusiastically proclaims, “I am so sick of people messing with my car. Yeah, I wanna press charges!”</p>\n<p>The offender begins to babble that he was just pulling a prank and that all sorts of people have screwed with his car in the past. The officers explain that it is no excuse for messing with a stranger’s vehicle and that they have no idea if the removal of the gas cap was all the young man would have done. The young man is charged with vehicle tampering, which is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine, imprisonment or both. The young man is placed in handcuffs and walked to a police car.</p>\n<p><b>The White Rubber Gloves</b></p>\n<p>Around 1:30 a.m., a large group of IVFP deputies and officers are standing in front of the 6500 DP beach access when a young man stumbles to the top of the stairs from the salty scented darkness below. The man is extremely intoxicated and appears suspicious. The officers now have probable cause to search him.</p>\n<p>This quickly leads to a classic “spread ’em” situation against a police car. Two officers put on white rubber gloves. One officer searches the man and hands whatever he finds to the other. The sea-loving drunkard has a round, silver flask full of dark alcohol. The liquor is poured out and the man is handcuffed and taken to the county jail for public intoxication. Once the man has sobered up, police will release him and he may receive some additional fines.</p>\n<p>Generally, courts will mandate that first-time offenders under 21 enroll in the Youth Offender Program. Penalties can include fines, the suspension of one’s driver license for one year and mandatory alcohol classes. In addition, UCSB may send a letter home to one’s parents detailing the violation.</p>\n<p>As far as I.V. weekends go, this particular night is actually uneventful. Police gave 25 citations and made two arrests, most of which were for open containers. Carrying an open container down DP is like playing Russian roulette and the safest way to win is not to play. The mistakes made by these rabble-rousers are easily avoided if you party as smart as you party hard.</p>\n<p>Sidebar:<br>\nGeneral Guidelines for Citation-Free Partying<br>\n1. Always carry your cups upside-down to show you have no booze and the IVFP will have no reason to stop you.<br>\n2. After midnight on weekends and ten on weekdays, music cannot be audible from 100 feet over a property line or you can get a noise infraction that comes with a $108 fine.<br>\n3. Walk your bike to avoid a BUI. That’s biking under the influence and although it may seem fun at the time, if convicted, you’ll have to go to court and possibly pay a fine of $1,300 and have your driver license suspended for a year.<br>\n4. Don’t carry an open container!<br>\n5. If you’re under 21, even carrying a closed container of alcohol for someone else can get you a citation.<br>\n6. Holding hands with 12 other people will not save you from getting in trouble if you’re intoxicated.<br>\n7. Don’t lie or mouth off to the IVFP.<br>\n8.

Gordon said one of the fundamental problems in evaluating the dropout problem is the lack of conclusive data and inconsistency of the results.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the biggest problems is that we don’t have a system for tracking students,” Gordon said. “We really don’t know the graduation rate. All we have is estimates. They’ve been working on it for years and years and years.”</p>\n<p>Professor Russell W. Rumberger, a prominent high school dropout researcher and CDRP director, said educators are interested in early indicators signaling potential dropouts. He said middle schools and junior high schools usually fail to report poor academic performance of students to high schools and colleges.</p>\n<p>“One of the best predictors [of dropouts] is if they’re failing in middle school,” Rumberger said. “We could do a better job preventing dropouts by looking at kids early on and seeing if we can do something about it before they get to high school.”</p>\n<p>Gordon said that students require more guidance through their educational years.</p>\n<p>“Good programs are ones that provide support,” he said. “It could be a teacher or it could be a counselor. Kids need connections with caring adults.”</p>\n<p>One program, UCSB’s Upward Bound, aims to encourage middle school and high school students in Santa Barbara County to attend college. It also provides services to UCSB students coming from disadvantaged families. On May 15, Congresswoman Lois Capps promised $400,000 in federal aid to support the program, which is currently stationed in a small trailer near South Hall.</p>\n<p><b>Encouraging Diversity</b></p>\n<p>In spite of these attempts to alleviate the situation, some professors have resorted to creating their own intervention programs to resolve the dropout crisis, which many feel has a direct effect on campus diversity. In response to the lack of minorities on campus, College of Creative Studies professor Caroline Allen launched a program to get local kids involved in summer art classes on campus.</p>\n<p>Allen said the CCS Summer Arts Institute offers writing, painting and photography classes to local students who may be the first in their family to attend college.</p>\n<p>In addition, Allen said the No Child Left Behind Act has had a detrimental effect on high school arts programs, as teachers are given less discretion as to the curriculum they choose to teach, and some instructors elect to only teach the material presented on standardized tests, which affects the amount of funding each school receives.</p>\n<p>“They have the five-paragraph essay shoved down their throats,” Allen said. “[Here, they] learn to have fun with their writing and be more expressive.”</p>\n<p>Alli Miarkiani, a former student of the summer institute, said the freedom of the CCS course pushed him to improve his own writing.  He said instructors used unique methods to motivate students.</p>\n<p>“They said, ‘here is a famous piece of writing, see if you can use this as an inspiration for your own writing,'” Miarkiani said. “My writing improved dramatically. It was amazing.”</p>\n<p>Allen said she hopes this program will encourage her mostly Latino students to consider college, especially UCSB.</p>\n<p>Rumberger said courses such as Allen’s a step in the right direction in trying to attract more minority students to UCSB. According to the CDRP website, Latinos are twice as likely as whites to drop out of school. Rumberger said schools must begin to cater toward the needs of Latino students.</p>\n<p>“Developing English language proficiency is critical to their success,” he said. “I don’t think there is a single best model, but clearly we need to do a better job at educating our Latino students.”</p>\n<p>Allen said universities and high schools need to inspire students to continue their education.</p>\n<p>“Bringing students on campus is an important step,” Allen said. “They need to know that good things happen here and they can be a part of it.”</p>\n<p>However, some instructors say other factors may explain why minorities do not come to UCSB. According to Black studies professor Dr. Gaye Theresa Johnson, UCSB is not considered a friendly environment for black students. Johnson also said that although more minorities are being accepted into UCSB, fewer students are enrolling, in part due to recent fee hikes.</p>\n<p>“The reason that they’re not coming is because fees are going up,” Johnson said. “[It’s] not just fee increases, but cutbacks in financial aid and increases in loans, but not in grants… Fee increases are an example of higher education becoming more elitist.”</p>\n<p>Just last week, Arnold Schwarzenegger confirmed a 7-10 percent increase in fees for the UC campuses as part of his 2007-08 California State Budget revisions.</p>\n<p>Johnson said the rise in previous black student acceptance rates is misleading.</p>\n<p>“Even though more black students are eligible for college, black economic disparity compared to white privilege makes black communities more embattled,” Johnson said. “It looks like [black students] have more access, but disparity in wealth is greater than it has ever been.”</p>\n<p><b>Socioeconomic Impact</b></p>\n<p>In addition to pinpointing the real dropout rate, CDRP aims to examine the economic and social costs that high school students who fail to obtain a diploma impose upon society. The new studies being produced will highlight common characteristics of potential dropouts and predict high school graduation statistics.</p>\n<p>Currently, the effects of dropping out have been shown to affect earnings, crime rates and even life expectancy, according to one study. In Fall 2005, Teachers College, Columbia University found the following: A high school dropouts earn about $260,000 less over their lifetime than their counterparts who earn diplomas. High school dropouts also live 9.2 years less on average than people who graduated high school. In addition, increasing the high school completion rate by 1 percent for all men ages 20-60 would save the U.S. up to $1.4 billion per year in reduced costs from crime.</p>\n<p>According to the California Dropout Research Project website, dropouts are incredibly costly to California, and are more likely to seek welfare support, commit crimes and become incarcerated. In fact, more than 80 percent of California’s prisoners, in 2005, did not graduate from high school, costing California taxpayers $35,000 for each inmate per year. The CDRP also asserts that dropouts suffer from poor health and are more likely to require public health support.</p>\n<p>The Public Policy Institute of California deemed that with the ongoing trends, twice as many high school students may drop out by the year 2025.</p>\n<p><b>Outreach and Preparation Programs</b></p>\n<p>In regards to programs that attempt to ensure graduation and further education, Gordon ok said Advancement Via Individual Determination, an in-school academic support program for grades 4-12 that prepares students for college, is extremely effective.</p>\n<p>“[A.V.I.D. is] a teaching plus a counseling program,” Gordon said. “Their success rate is phenomenal. The figure is 84 percent who get admitted into college and 100 percent who graduate the High School Exit Exam.”</p>\n<p>While Gordon said college outreach programs are often misdirected. He said the programs advertised the benefits of a college education instead of assisting parents and student throughout the application process.</p>\n<p>“I think the outreach stuff is misplaced,” he said. “We do not need to convince [students] that it’s important go to college. Until you help families navigate the bureaucracy, they don’t have a chance. Filling out forms is completely foreign to them. The families had no more idea about how to get a college application or financial aid than to be an astronaut.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s own Student Initiated Outreach Program, which prepares K-12 students to succeed in college, strives to increase underrepresented student populations on college campuses by encouraging a “college-going atmosphere.” Among other programs, their services include group visits to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Third-year Asian American studies major and current SIOP chair Tuyen Nguyen said the committee gives funding to student groups who work with high schools to encourage student success.</p>\n<p>“[The student groups] describe a project proposal and the student organization,” Nguyen said. “They bring hundreds and hundreds of students on a outreach day to give the students an idea that education in college is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Over 15 student organizations are represented on campus including Hermanos Unidos, Black Student Union and El Congreso. They bring students on campus to attend cultural and historical workshops as well as to classes that discuss the required curriculum they will need to complete in order to secure admission.</p>\n<p><b>Barriers</b></p>\n<p>However, some high schools don’t even offer the classes UC schools require.</p>\n<p>Sheilagh Polk, media relations manager for Community Coalition, a nonprofit organization that works to help south L.A. residents, said the Fighting for the Future program is working to ensure local schools provide the necessary classes.</p>\n<p>“A number of students weren’t eligible to attend a Cal State or a UC university because they were missing a math or science requirement,” Polk said. “It wasn’t because students didn’t want to take these classes, but they weren’t offered.”</p>\n<p>One such school is L.A.’s John C. Fremont Senior High. In addition to missing requirements, Polk said its students score significantly lower on their S.A.T.s.</p>\n<p>At Fremont, between 2004 and 2005, the average score was 352 for Verbal and 368 for Math, totaling 720 out of a possible 1600. That puts its participants in the bottom 10 percent of all test takers.</p>\n<p>The newest version of the S.A.T., implemented in 2006, now includes a writing portion on the exam worth 800 points, which brings the perfect score total to 2400 as opposed to the previous 1600.</p>\n<p>According to Collegeboard.com, the 2006 mean S.A.T. scores for college-bound seniors were 503 for Critical Reading, 518 for Math and 497 for Writing totaling 1518 out of a possible 2400.</p>\n<p>The averages for UCSB’s incoming class of 2007 are 616 for Critical Reading, 636 for Math, and 614 for Writing, totaling 1866.</p>\n<p><b>Exit Exams</b></p>\n<p>Being eligible to attend college is one issue; being eligible to graduate from high school is another. 2007 marks the second year that the state will require students to obtain a passing grade on the California High School Exit Exam in order to graduate.</p>\n<p>Polk said students should graduate from high school if they pass their classes.</p>\n<p>“I am against the CAHSEE exam because I feel it is unfair to punish them for 12 years of inadequate education,” Polk said. “They can’t pass a test they weren’t prepared for.”</p>\n<p>However, Gordon said most of the students who do not pass also lack the required credits, and would not have graduated anyway. He said in Sacramento, only 3 to 4 percent of students were denied a diploma solely because they did not pass the CAHSEE.</p>\n<p>Rumberger said that while the intentions behind the CAHSEE are good, poor implementation hinders the program’s success. Instead, he suggested the state offer differentiated diplomas – degrees based on varying high school and testing performance, so that all students who take required classes and pass would receive a degree. He said schools could then identify exceptional students by issuing higher-ranking diplomas.</p>\n<p>“I think the idea [of the CAHSEE] is good but the way it is being done is not so good,” Rumberger said. “The idea of assessing how much kids know by two subjects, math and English [is flawed]. If a kid scores one point less than another kid, should they not get a diploma? It seems so arbitrary.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14303\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14303\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/","id":3278,"author":{"id":341,"name":"Lee Desser"},"related":[3277,3276,3275],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, My Friends","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Yes.

And what a year. Excuse me for taunting you with my superiority complex and self-fellating egoism, but this is the column to do it in. My goodbye column. My au revoir to the Daily Nexus. My exit stage left.</p>\n<p>We got some redesigns, plumped up our columnists to opinion page ratio, hired the best staff this side of the Goleta Slough, broke top news, saved the Nexus from government ineptitude with the cunning use of middle-fingering, and hey, along with the Daily Sound, we’re the only daily newspaper left in this city. Cheers!</p>\n<p>Yep, to answer your next question, I am pretty hot shit.</p>\n<p>And I owe it all to you. No, not you, the average reader, reading this. I mean the people below in the staff box, and all those who came before and all those yet to come. Thank you, Brendan Buhler, Jason La (I learned the most from you), Daniel Haier, Matt Dozier. My hat’s off to Kristen Richer. Thanks for the memories; hope y’all join me in Nexus Valhalla for a few drinks.</p>\n<p>Where would I be without my loyal staff this year? It’s rare to work with people you love, and even rarer to work with people you respect and trust to do the job well.</p>\n<p>My friends, I wish I had the words, I often do, but they say to write from your heart and since you have half of mine, this message will be a slice of what it could have been.</p>\n<p>To Devon Claire Flannery, for being my first lieutenant and second set of eyes, particularly for catching all those potentially ugly mistakes (as well as the ones that got through). You not only polished the paper, you made it sparkle. You also kept us out of a lot of trouble, while managing to raise hell. If I weren’t such a stickler, I give you a smiley emoticon right now.</p>\n<p>Police Blotter extraordinaire Nikki Moore – barrel of monkeys level of fun and Southern Comfort level of intoxicating. You steered a big ship at county desk, and brought in too many catches to count. Here’s to your passion; it made it all the while.</p>\n<p>David Ferry. Stop whatever you’re doing. No, put it down. Put Aria down. And yes, there is a Santa Claus. He’s bringing you pants without holes in them.</p>\n<p>Dana Olsen, you’ve got a big job ahead of you, one I know you’re ready for. Have fun covering county supervisors, court cases, drunken revelry and the occasional dead albino raccoon. You’ll do it with flare and maybe a “Legends of the Hidden Temple” shirt.</p>\n<p>Miss Lindsey Miller – you were a constant counselor, a wise peer and a good friend. You did a better job at university desk than I, and probably with a lot less yelling. I’m glad we grew up in the office together. The honor was all mine. (Comma splice!)</p>\n<p>Megan “I’m not 15” Snedden: I had you picked out from day one, kid. You’re going far. You deserve nothing less. When I own my own paper, I’ll let you cover Leg again, if you really want it.</p>\n<p>Aria Miran. You and Ferry need a timeout. But really, a few laughs and inappropriate jokes with you make the medicine go down. You definitely make it to my top eight MySpace friends list. Even as a fresh-faced reporter you stuck out as something more, like a fresh-faced university editor. Welcome to the desk; I wouldn’t want it left in any other hands.</p>\n<p>I’m really sorry, Sabrina Ricci, for all those times we accidentally called you “Christina Ricci” when you weren’t in news meeting. Now you know. And now I’m graduating, so you can’t get mad. You got heart and the fortunate job of “layout editor,” complete with all the sexual innuendos associated with “laying” stuff out.</p>\n<p>Aaron Wu and Matt O’Leary, y’all put up with some confused editors, last minute shots and spectacularly boring board meetings. Thank you for your endless patience. We would be spectacularly boring without you. And sans pretty pictures.</p>\n<p>To my most valuable player and fellow graduate Anna Oleson-Wheeler. What didn’t you do? AOW, with a flick of your wrist you had AP, reception and production under wraps, with a bit of nod to sports. Thanks for the memories and double thanks for the booze.</p>\n<p>To Barb Maclean, Linda Meyer and J.E. Anderson. Your devotion to us kids knows no bounds, and your guidance was irreplaceable. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope we made you proud.</p>\n<p>More with sports, we got Chris Hoffman, but my heart belongs to Monique Moyal and Jeff Gibson. Monique, we missed you. And Jeff, you need to stop stressing. You should try pot sometime.</p>\n<p>Those cool kids at Artsweek – Mollie Vandor, Sophia Kercher and my fellow Lasallian Cameron Smith – thanks for putting up with the changes, but also thanks for delivering the hipster to our pages. It’s nice not being lame through and through.</p>\n<p>Oh, Nicki Arnold. Way to hold the fort down in the opinion office, and thank you for being a great staff writer the year before. You are the bee’s knees, and have a contagious smile.</p>\n<p>Mark Batalla, my answer to your question is “Oh. Dear. God. Sigh. Fine, print it.” You were my happiest excuse never to censor, and I’m glad you trusted to ask me first. You dedicated more of your talent here than just about anyone, and it certainly didn’t go unnoticed. I’d mention each of your artists by name, but I’d rather someone write in angry about it so I could see more of their work. You all made the opinion page everyone’s first stop in the morning. It was a pleasure.</p>\n<p>Online Editor Craig Calkins, Jesus Christ you stepped it up. We’ll make it to that shining city of perfect websites one of these days. You were tenacious, talented and occasionally morally perverse, a contradiction wrapped in a certainty. I don’t even know what I just wrote, but you were awesome.</p>\n<p>But I’m eager to get on you, copy cats. Copy, you will always be loved, sometimes feared, with nothing but a comma and an adverb separating the two. Dianne Jobson, good luck in your new position. Just slow down on the caffeine pills. Kate Rushton, I’m glad to be graduating with you, though I’ll also be glad to see you at your new beginnings – you’ve got the right stuff. Valerie Tidwell, not only are you a worthy redhead, you’re also the sharpest knife in the drawer, capable of cutting anyone down to size. You were a miracle staff writer as well.</p>\n<p>Melissa Davis and Becky Gayle, you deserve a special place in my heart, and I will miss you. Melissa, McCarthy was a bad man. Becky, goddamn we missed you.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to name all of you, copy (par for the course, right?). Just know you had the hardest job and a hushed respect in the office. You made my nights a joy, and my newspaper the best I’ve seen. Thank you so much.</p>\n<p>How much happiness it brings me to end with you, Nick DŸrnhšfer. The wisest advice I received when I became editor I will now pass on to you: It doesn’t matter if you break the biggest story of the century, or take down some bad guys or win first place awards in every category. It matters that you take care of the Nexus so that one day, your successor can. You’ve learned all you can from me, and outpaced my creativity. I got a sneaking feeling you’re going to be that first-place-winning successor.</p>\n<p>Just remember that a year from now, all this will seem very funny. You have no idea what that means now. I didn’t when Dozier told me, or when Daniel told him, etc. You’ll get it. But don’t rush there. You got some time to put in.</p>\n<p>Goodbye, my friends. So long, and see you later. Goodnight Nexus, one last time.<br>\nYour Friend,<br>\nKaitlin Pike</p>\n<p>P.S.

From the closure of beloved record stores to the incinerated Bank of America building, I.V. continually reinvents itself. Yet, the creation and implementation of the 736-page-long Isla Vista Master Plan will encourage an entirely new change. It changes zoning codes, gives I.V. a downtown facelift and updates parks and roadways throughout I.V. to streamline transportation.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Project Area Committee will review the IVMP today, and if it is approved, the project will go before the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors for final consideration. The latter decision, in addition to one made by the California Coastal Commission, could result in new two- to three-story buildings in I.V. as well as a refurbished soccer field and a new skate park.</p>\n<p><b>Plastic Surgery for Pardall </b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the most prominent ideas in the IVMP is a publicly funded facelift for the “downtown” I.V. area.

The plan provides Pardall with widened sidewalks and bike lanes to encourage pedestrian access and safe bicycling.</p>\n<p>The IVMP also aims to revamp the fa</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14251\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-23/a-not-so-simple-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14251\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-23/a-not-so-simple-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-23/a-not-so-simple-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-23/a-not-so-simple-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-23/a-not-so-simple-plan/","id":1092,"author":{"id":339,"name":"Matthew Weisner"},"related":[1091,1090,1089],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Methamphetamine Ravages SB County","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Methamphetamine has cooked in Santa Barbara County drug laboratories for decades, yet its current prevalence trumps even the days when Andy Warhol's cohort Edie Sedgwick made her meth-fueled romps thr...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Methamphetamine has cooked in Santa Barbara County drug laboratories for decades, yet its current prevalence trumps even the days when Andy Warhol’s cohort Edie Sedgwick made her meth-fueled romps through Isla Vista’s streets.</p>\n<p>It is the drug of choice in the county, and accounts for a significant portion of its crime, particularly in North County. Its popularity maintains a stronghold in I.V. and at UCSB, and it can still be found in the homes of 40-year-old dealers on Abrego Road or in the dorms of 18-year-old freshmen on campus.</p>\n<p>Oft ignored and rarely talked about outside of the C.A.S.E. classroom, the drug has infiltrated the area. In 2005, for instance, 78 percent of drug-related bookings to juvenile hall were for meth, while more than half of Santa Maria’s Drug Court participants who tested positive for drugs were found to have meth in their system.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Beyond the personal problems related to health and general well-being, meth causes a headache for the county both for its financial and social costs. Officials hope to cut the problem off at the knees, but are finding the eradication – or mere stemming of it – increasingly complex.</p>\n<p><b>Antifreeze, Drain Cleaner and Kitty Litter</b></p>\n<p>Created by the Japanese a century ago, and used by Kamikazes before they made their last flights, meth was recently named California’s “drug of choice” by a report from the county’s Methamphetamine Prevention Network Summit. But you don’t have to tell Santa Barbara County officials that; community leaders have been decrying meth’s prevalence for years.</p>\n<p>Meth is a stimulant that activates the central nervous system and drastically increases the amount of dopamine – a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, enjoyment, and positive reinforcement – in the brain. And thanks to that jolt of euphoric dopamine, meth is more addictive than many other drugs.</p>\n<p>“The sensation of anything by comparison – pleasurable sex or easy money – is dwarfed by the amount of dopamine meth releases into the brain,” said John Doyel, the treatment coordinator for Santa Barbara Alcohol, Drug &amp; Mental Health Services. “It is more addicting than alcohol or marijuana.”</p>\n<p>Crystal meth appeals to all sorts of people, from the weight-conscious woman who uses the drug to curb her appetite to the student who uses it as a study aid to the curious preteen, Doyel said.</p>\n<p>“It is a culturally synchronic pandemic that fits in beautifully with American society, as it appeals to things we value, like optimism,” Doyel said.</p>\n<p>What’s more, anyone can brew methamphetamines with a mixture of household items, including detergents, cold medicines and kitty litter. And addicts can get high almost any way they please: Meth can be injected, inhaled, or ingested. Of course, purchasing it isn’t that difficult either: a few doses run for about $20.</p>\n<p>In the short term, meth can induce irritability, insomnia, confusion, tremors, convulsions, cardiovascular collapse or even death. Meth users also often develop “meth mouth,” in which their teeth rot out of their head as a result of the drug and the user’s poor dental habits and the consumption of sugary drinks, which users crave on binges. Even if a user quits the habit, he or she is still subject to a slew of long-term effects, including vitamin and mineral deficiencies, lowered resistance to disease and organ damage to the lungs, liver and kidneys.</p>\n<p>But then, the user isn’t the only one who suffers. Families in Santa Barbara have been torn apart over the drug; about half of the 300 child out-of-home placements as of July 1, 2006 were done so as a result of abuse or neglect resulting from a parent’s meth use.</p>\n<p>Some I.V. residents have noticed the influx of the drug into their beachside town. In a report given to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors, former UCSB student Shanna McGuiness said she had seen the drug – and its effects – in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I have recently heard that meth has been circulating in I.V., and I am hoping that it does not become the new trend, because I have seen the effects it can have on families,” she said. “It’s disturbing to know that this is the drug people in California are using, because it has the potential to be more harmful than other things.”</p>\n<p><b>Meth and U(niversities)</b></p>\n<p>Because of meth’s widespread appeal – and the “Superman” feeling associated with it – meth addiction has spread like a weed in California, which the National Institute on Drug Abuse said has one of the highest rates of meth usage.</p>\n<p>Colleges are a hotbed for meth usage, Doyel said.</p>\n<p>“This is a drug that has always been a problem in California; they used to deal it everywhere up at Stanford because kids used it to study harder,” he said. “There is still an old speed limit sign posted up on frat row that says ‘Speed, $5 a hit.'”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program assistant director Al Rodriguez described the typical meth user in the Santa Barbara area as “a young adult, typically male, unemployed and from North County,” the issue hit close to home last year when university officials discovered a meth lab inside a residence hall room, after the two occupants had been kicked out of the university due to low GPAs.</p>\n<p>A former neighbor of the dorm room meth producers, who wishes to remain anonymous, said although he knew his neighbors dealt drugs from time to time, he had no idea that people in the building were involved in the production of crystal meth.</p>\n<p>“I knew they experimented with a lot of stuff, but didn’t know about the lab until they got kicked out of school,” he said. “Every new drug was a new story. I was never home at the same time as them, so I didn’t know them very well, but they told me they had used meth once or twice and said it was kind of crazy…</p>\n<p>“I knew a lot of people who used meth last year but never thought it was a problem,” he said. From observing his neighbors’ use, he said he could tell the drug “is really addictive and makes people really awake and really hyper.”</p>\n<p>The student said it was somewhat frightening that no one would have known about the existence of the on-campus lab if the pair had not been kicked out.</p>\n<p>Other students reacted similarly upon hearing about last year’s incident.</p>\n<p>“It really scares me that something like this could have happened on this campus , because I had no idea that a crystal meth lab could have been next door to me,” said Sandra Stokes, a second year linguistics major. “I had no idea that meth was a problem in this area, let alone on our campus.”</p>\n<p><b>A Santa Maria Export?</b></p>\n<p>But outside Isla Vista and UCSB’s domain, the problem is not nearly as hidden. According to 4th District Supervisor Joni Gray, crystal meth has created a “crisis” and is a “burden for the county because of the way it destroys peoples’ lives.”</p>\n<p>In certain parts of Santa Barbara County – particularly North County and the Santa Maria area – Gray said meth helps contribute to high levels of violent behavior and abuse, in addition to the overcrowding of county jails.</p>\n<p>According to a January 2007 county report, meth use has mushroomed in a relatively short span of time; in 2001, 19 percent of patients in county drug treatment programs claimed meth as their primary drug, but in 2006 this increased to 31 percent, making it the drug of choice in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Currently, about 55 percent of Drug Court participants in Santa Maria who tested positive for drug use were found to be on meth; in Lompoc – a possible location for a new detox program site – the statistic is 42 percent, while in Santa Barbara it is 33 percent.</p>\n<p>“It destroys families because parents lose their sense of right or wrong,” Gray said.</p>\n<p>Gray recalled an incident involving two parents who accidentally killed their child while under the influence of crystal meth.</p>\n<p>“They literally rolled over [in bed] and suffocated their own child while sleeping,” Gray said.</p>\n<p>Apparently the tragedy is not entirely unheard of. Last March, Lompoc resident Jason Gomez rolled over on his infant twins and suffocated them to death while under the influence of methamphetamines.</p>\n<p>Kelly Rodriguez, a recovered meth abuser, told the Methamphetamine Prevention Network Summit that the drug practically ruined her life: She lost her children, went to jail and became homeless.</p>\n<p>“Using meth was the most self-destructive thing I’ve ever done,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Biting Back at “Meth Mouth”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors is currently looking for a solution to the meth “epidemic.” The Methamphetamine Prevention Network Summit’s report painted a dour picture of the current resources.</p>\n<p>“Services were being strained and circumstances such as county jail over-crowding, waiting lists for detoxification and overwhelming caseload for child welfare services were attributed to meth abuse,” the report states.</p>\n<p>One possible new approach, highlighted in the report to the board, is a project called “From ‘Me’ to ‘We.'”</p>\n<p>“It’s a new benchmark for bringing together a broad-based coalition of public and private agencies, organizations and other stakeholders to fight the impact of methamphetamine,” Gray said of the program.</p>\n<p>The “broad-based coalition” aims to bolster its ranks with forums held throughout the spring to get the public support and to create more strategies for combating the problem.</p>\n<p>Others note the answer isn’t an easy one. Regardless, Rodriguez of the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program said the meth problem in the county needs to be proactively addressed.</p>\n<p>“Our collective approach to our meth problem needs rethinking,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14150\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14150\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/","id":3555,"author":{"id":348,"name":"Casey Ibbetson"},"related":[3554,3553,3552],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sheriff Brown Wants Crowded Inmates Off Floor, in Jail Beds","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The stress on Santa Barbara County jails over the past decade has almost busted the concrete foundations on which the nearly impenetrable fortresses rest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The stress on Santa Barbara County jails over the past decade has almost busted the concrete foundations on which the nearly impenetrable fortresses rest.

As the years have gone by and the county population has grown, the number of jail cells has remained almost constant, he said. Throughout his campaign, and during his first 100 days in office, Brown has placed the blame squarely on outdated infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“The crux of the problem is that our jail infrastructure was built in the 1970s, and has had minimal additions,” Brown said.  “Our infrastructure has been outpaced by our population growth.”</p>\n<p>Along with overcrowding, the aging facilities have created a slew of other problems for the county, Brown said. Most drastically, the Sheriff’s Dept. has been forced to shorten non-violent criminals’ stays in the county jail, just to ensure that more inmates can fit in.</p>\n<p>“We have had to adjust our criteria for who we incarcerate and how long they stay. People that should be in jail aren’t,” Brown said. “When this starts happening, you start to lose the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.”</p>\n<p>Due to a cap on the numbers of prisoners allowed in each facility and a California Superior Court ruling, the county only has one other option besides releasing non-violent prisoners early – incarcerate fewer people.</p>\n<p>The county has sentenced law-breakers to other punitive programs, but the net effect is, as 3rd District Supervisor Brooks Firestone put it, that there are people on the streets that were sentenced to not be on the streets.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor Nikki Jones, who has a Ph.D. in criminology and teaches at UCSB, sees the situation in a different light. Since jails across the state are overflowing, and the crime rate has dropped, the problem, Jones said, does not lie in the size of county jails but instead in the criminal justice system itself.</p>\n<p>“Over the last decade or so, the crime rate has dropped off significantly from record highs in the early ’90s and late ’90s,” she said. “This introduces a serious contradiction: Why is it that our incarcerated population continues to grow even though crime isn’t increasing?”</p>\n<p>“Tough on crime” policies and mandatory sentences like the Three Strikes rule have more than made up for the drop in criminal activity, Jones said.</p>\n<p>“These policy changes increase the number of men and women who are incarcerated in our nation’s jails and prisons and puts pressure on local institutions, like county jails, that do not have the infrastructure to warehouse – as many of our facilities now do – the large numbers of people who enter its doors,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the cause, Firestone said the problem has gotten so bad that there are 10 to 20 more convicts than there are beds every night in the county jail, forcing prisoners to spend the night on the ground.</p>\n<p><b>Possible Solutions</b></p>\n<p>In lieu of overhauling the entire criminal justice system, the most obvious solution for officials has been to build a new prison. The idea has been raised many times and in increasing fervor as the overcrowding has become more severe.</p>\n<p>The most popular plan of the moment calls for the new jail to be built in the northern portion of the county, near Santa Maria. Sheriff Brown, whose campaign pushed the jail issue hard, said the proposed North County jail could house 800 inmates, and decisively solve the overcrowding problem.</p>\n<p>But, naturally, it would not be cheap.</p>\n<p>The daunting $153 million price tag – which would also include an estimated annual operation cost of anywhere from $19 to 30 million – has kept the facility from becoming a reality.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors, which is ultimately in charge of the funding, feels that the bill is too steep, and Firestone said the public agrees. According to the supervisor, a poll was given to the public asking whether they would be in favor of an increase in the sales tax to fund the proposed prison – the poll came back a resounding “no.”</p>\n<p><b>State-Funded Jail</b></p>\n<p>However, recent state legislation has given Brown another shot at fulfilling his campaign promises. Under a deal reached last month between the governor and state legislators, $7.4 billion of state funds will go into prison and rehabilitation programs, and $1.2 billion of that has been earmarked for local jail beds – the largest sum of money ever allocated by the state for jails.</p>\n<p>Due to the severity of area’s problem and the amount of work the county has already put into trying to solve it, Santa Barbara is well positioned to receive some of those funds, Brown said.</p>\n<p>The proposed state-funded facility would have 800 beds and the county would only have to pay for three-eighths of the construction and a portion of the operational costs.</p>\n<p>But, as Firestone and Brown have both said, “The devil is in the details.” The catch is that of the 800 total beds, 500 would be reserved for state prisoners, as opposed to county prisoners. The legislature also requires that the facility would have a re-entry station, aimed at better preparing convicts for their re-entry into society.</p>\n<p>The opposition has argued that the state funding comes with too many strings attached, but Brown argues the prison would still be a great benefit.</p>\n<p>“Sure there could be some additional costs, but we would benefit from an economy of scale. We are getting a long-term solution for a much smaller cost,” Brown said. “It is a great benefit to us to accept a joint facility with the state.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, with the current recidivism rate – the percentage of released prisoners that return to committing crimes and are caught – at 70 percent, Brown and state legislators have applauded the required re-entry stations.</p>\n<p>The high recidivism rate is a particular problem for Jones, who said that educational programs inside prisons would help reduce the number of readmissions.</p>\n<p>“Since 95 percent of people who enter jails and prison eventually are released, and our jails and prisons – especially in California – offer little educational or treatment programs for people who are incarcerated, we have set a large number of men and women up for failure once they are released from these facilities,” she said.</p>\n<p><b>For Now</b></p>\n<p>To help persuade the public to accept the deal, Brown has created a “blue-ribbon” panel of experts from various disciplines to look into the proposed solutions. He said he hopes that the public will see the multi-disciplined group and know that the sheriff is not just asking the county for unnecessary funds, but that the proposal is well researched and well founded. He believes that this approach is much more marketable to the public.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, at least until the North County jail issue is solved, Brown is looking for short-term solutions.</p>\n<p>One of his originally proposed options is already off the table. On the campaign trail, Brown proposed shipping inmates over to a vacant jail facility in Tulare County, which was empty due to a lack of funding in the county. Since then, the county has procured funds, and all beds in the jail are accounted for.</p>\n<p>Now, the sheriff’s short-term solutions include an agreement with the Lompoc City Jail to house county inmates; efforts to use more home incarcerations; a remodeling of older facilities; and a change of the Lompoc County holding facility from a Type I facility to a Type II facility. The change would allow the facility to hold prisoners for longer than the current 96-hour limit, he said.</p>\n<p>But no matter what the county builds, Jones said the underlying societal problems will remain.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, this is not a problem that we can build our way out of,” she said.</p>\n<p>Until jails offer college courses, General Education Development programs, mental health and addiction treatments, the problem will never truly be solved, Jones said.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately,” she said, “the real solution to this problem must come from outside the criminal justice system.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Now, citing success in other college communities, officials at recently interviewed corporate student housing companies say they would like to expand their influence in Isla Vista, a move that could revolutionize the variety of ownership and, according to some local authorities, increase competition and shift the feel of community in the area.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The supply and demand for housing in this one-half square mile town is also facing shifts at the hands of the university and the I.V. Master Plan. By Fall 2008, UCSB will add around 1,000 new spaces to its arsenal of housing for undergraduates and graduate students with the San Clemente project on El Colegio Road, and about 380 additional spaces for faculty and staff will follow in the next few years. And as part of the new I.V. Master Plan, which is currently in the approval process, within the next few years I.V. zoning changes may accommodate up to 4,330 new residents.</p>\n<p>For now, the California Costal Commission’s cap on the UCSB student body as part of the 1990 Long Range Development Plan remains at 20,000, but campus administrators working on the new goals for the university’s growth say the student body may see an increase of 5,000 once the plan gets approved.</p>\n<p>Of course, in a community that is 95.4 percent renters, demand for housing remains high despite the continually raising rent prices – the rental vacancy rate, according to the 2000 census, is at 1.2 percent, while the national rate is at 4 percent. And though the housing market has recently changed, investors are still willing to pay comparatively high property purchase prices to be a part of this unique area.</p>\n<p><b>The Corporate Side</b></p>\n<p>“Many campuses have interesting and eclectic student housing neighborhoods like Isla Vista,” said Craig Cardwell, president of Allen &amp; O’Hara. “There are none that I can think of that are in a setting such as UCSB and Isla Vista, with the mountains on one side and the ocean on the other side, with the pleasant weather, diverse population, and an enormously large number of students – UCSB and SBCC – in a restricted growth living environment.”</p>\n<p>Because most investors consider student demand to be in fairly constant supply, especially at a developing university like UCSB, economics professor Stephen LeRoy, who specializes in finance, said student housing investors are just betting that the prices on their properties will eventually rise.</p>\n<p>“The university is not going to shrink – it’s not a stupid bet,” said LeRoy, who lived on Del Playa Drive for four years. “There’s also housing being built, so put that into more students fighting over more housing.”</p>\n<p>This interplay between corporate student housing companies with large holdings in the community and existing owners could create more competition for student attention, said Kris Miller-Fisher, director of special projects for Third District Supervisor Brooks Firestone. This, she said, will yield higher quality living for renters.</p>\n<p>“Some people have owned their properties for a long time,” Miller-Fisher said. “The new owners want to keep their units filled, so my guess is it would make it more competitive, and better for students.”</p>\n<p>Conquest’s first building in the area, Breakpointe, located on the 6600 block of Abrego Road, was completely renovated two years ago before the first residents moved in, and after the previous occupants were offered the chance to break their lease early. The company’s newest acquisition, Coronado, is currently being remodeled amidst several protests due to the August evictions of its 55 units of tenants, most of whom were low-income Latino families, from the 6626 Picasso Rd. complex. The building is scheduled to open for renters in the fall.</p>\n<p>Conquest Student Housing Manager Eric Johnson said the company, which manages 19 properties in the USC area, hopes to replicate its USC success as the “number one housing provider” in Isla Vista by maintaining an attention to detail.</p>\n<p>“We can meet an untapped need – high quality, safe student housing,” Johnson said. “[With Breakpointe and Coronado], we took buildings that had not been upgraded in many years, and added a whole new facade, a state-of-the-art fitness center with individual plasmas on each machine, brand new unit interiors with all new appliances and fixtures in the kitchens and baths, Ethernet, Dish Network television, a new fire pit, a BBQ area by the pool, etcetera.”</p>\n<p>Johnson said three-bedroom apartments in both buildings are sold out, with five apartments left at Breakpointe. Coronado has been leased to about 70 percent capacity, but he said he expects it will sell out soon.</p>\n<p>Neither Conquest nor Allen &amp; O’Hara are new to student housing. Conquest has been at USC since 1993, and Allen &amp; O’Hara has been around since 1963, and it was the original developer of Francisco Torres from 1968 to 1998. UCSB acquired FT in 2002, and with it came the rowdy reputation still intact to this day. Allen &amp; O’Hara has 66 communities at college campuses across the United States.</p>\n<p>Allen &amp; O’Hara purchased Fontainebleu, the privately owned residence hall-style complex, located at 6525 El Colegio Rd., several years ago. Like on-campus residence halls, Fontainebleu offers students living in suites meal plans, cleaning, cable and utilities. Tropicana, located at 6585 El Colegio Rd., has a similar layout and is also privately owned.</p>\n<p>Cardwell, a UCSB graduate, said he feels large companies have more resources available to them to improve the environment for their renters.</p>\n<p>“A private owner can do an excellent job providing a good student housing environment, and many do,” Cardwell said. “A large company such as ours… with a complete culture dedicated to the student experience, and access to many sources of short and long term capital, probably has a better chance of providing a successful experience for students over a longer number of years.”</p>\n<p><b>The Flip Side</b></p>\n<p>Not everyone is a fan of the corporate model, or they are at least careful to give praise. Chuck Eckert, chairman of the executive committee of the I.V. Property Owners’ Association, said he thinks the attention to management of the buildings is more important than the size of the company.</p>\n<p>“My personal opinion is that much more important than who owns the property is the management policy,” Eckert said. “You can have good management that manages five units or 500 units; it depends on the policies and the people. … To do a good job managing you have to manage enough units so that you have somebody paying diligent attention to management and maintenance issues.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UCSB Dean of Students Yonie Harris said she is concerned that larger companies focusing on the business of student housing may miss the importance of history to a community. For instance, she said she thinks the 6626 Picasso “no cause” evictions came out of a misunderstanding and lack of sensitivity to I.V.’s community, which consists of a large percentage of renters.</p>\n<p>“I think what companies miss is an understanding of what the full community is,” Harris said. “You can’t just go from place to place. … If you provide housing in a small community you have to understand the community. Large companies may miss that. I.V. has a history and the students who live there have values.”</p>\n<p><b>Historically Speaking</b></p>\n<p>Vestiges of I.V.’s past still remain, posing challenges for investors and planners alike. The town’s characteristically skinny streets, lack of parking, and quickly constructed buildings are a result of the 1950s building boom, which came shortly after the UC Regents announced plans in 1948 to relocate UCSB from Santa Barbara’s hills to its current location.</p>\n<p>Despite original plans to keep UCSB to the size of a small liberal arts school with around 3,500 students, in 1958 the Regents announced that the student body cap would increase to 10,000, bringing an additional 2,000 to 3,000 faculty and staff members to the area as well as a desperate need for housing.</p>\n<p>With the exception of Manzanita Village, UCSB Housing and Residential Services Director Wilfred Brown said the university built all of its on-campus residence halls during this peak period – the school’s opening in 1954 through 1968 – all the while making I.V. property owners eager to cash in on the overflow renters’ need for housing.</p>\n<p>Dean of Students Yonie Harris said the zoning originally put in place by the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors to regulate I.V.’s development was not adequately enforced and repeatedly disobeyed by owners racing to put up properties.</p>\n<p>“There was a relax of zoning regulations and builders in I.V. were allowed to not build to code,” Harris said. “Builders were allowed to ignore setbacks, the parking regulations were relaxed. In order to get enough building to occur, certain policies and regulations were relaxed or overlooked.”</p>\n<p>Harris arrived in the area shortly after the 1970 bank burning and rioting in protest of the Vietnam War. She lived in I.V. for 27 years and was involved in the Isla Vista community before she started at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It always struck me how perfect it is for college students,” Harris said of Isla Vista. “It’s on a human scale. Community involvement is very easy to slide into … when you’re part of a community it leaves an imprint on you and how you view the world.”</p>\n<p>By the numbers, in 2006 Isla Vista drew approximately 2,000 more students than its closest competitor, UCSB. According to Community Housing Office survey results, in Fall Quarter 2006, 8,450 students lived in Isla Vista, 6,372 students lived in university-owned housing, 2,407 lived in Goleta and 1,489 lived in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Most students want the ‘college experience’ of living in I.V.,” CHO Manager Roane Akchurin, a UCSB alum, said. “Living in their own apartment is part of the experience. It’s been there, and it’s been a legend.”</p>\n<p><b>Market Forces</b></p>\n<p>The current incarnation of a limited housing supply, sky-high demand and a history of pro-development county polices makes I.V. a plum for savvy real estate investors, especially for larger companies looking to expand.</p>\n<p>These companies have their plates full in terms of financing, said Brian Bailey, a Central Coast Investments real estate broker. Whereas an investor of a smaller building would be able to obtain as much as an 80 percent loan, he said lenders are much more cautious dealing with a business investor – sometimes requiring payments in cash and a larger down payment. He said it is important for the companies to have cash flow right away to start paying off their loans.</p>\n<p>Bailey, a graduate of UCSB, has represented buyers and sellers in Isla Vista real estate transactions for the past 30 years. As a student, he never lived in I.V. because of the noise, but when he got his real estate broker’s license in 1979 he started working there – much to more experienced brokers chagrin.</p>\n<p>“When I began, I.V. as a location on the Central Coast was pariah – my fellow brokers wouldn’t even drive out there,” he said. “The area was looked down on [and I was told my] reputation would suffer. I liked that because it meant no one else was going to do it.”</p>\n<p>As the tumultuous times of the 1970s fade into memory, so I.V. has become a more acceptable place to invest. Despite the area’s newly earned mainstream status, Bailey said the values for buyers are not as good as they once were.</p>\n<p>In the past two years, he said, there have been more properties up for sale – as many as six or seven at a time compared to three in the past – because the purchase market is slowly shifting to a buyer’s market, which means there are fewer buyers and property values have flattened or dropped.</p>\n<p>“Properties not at their highest and best use or needing further development or remodeling and properties in other than optimal locations, with deferred maintenance or other challenges, have not fared as well in the current market,” Bailey said. “The market for this type of property is still liquid, but is price sensitive. Apartment buildings priced in line with the current market will sell within a reasonable period of time. There are a larger number of properties available of this type than usual.”</p>\n<p>Allen &amp; O’Hara Education Services President Craig Cardwell noted that though rents may be relatively high, student-housing investment does not often produce short-term returns, which is something many new investors do not expect.</p>\n<p>“While the rents may seem higher than for other forms of real estate, the operating expenses, insurance expenses and capital improvement expenses to keep a student housing community in good condition are much more than for other forms of real estate,” Cardwell said. “So, on a net basis, student housing can be characterized as a form of investment that has reasonable, but not large returns on invested capital.”</p>\n<p>Bailey said real estate in general is never a good short-term investment because of its frequent up and down cycles. He tells people to expect to own the property for a minimum of 10 years, but suggests never selling and refinancing to free up more money.</p>\n<p>In addition to attracting those who are secure with the market, Bailey said I.V. attracts younger buyers who are comfortable dealing with students and their parents, as well as the specific maintenance issues such customers tend to create. According to the 2000 census, the median age of residents in I.V. is 21.1.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, in student rental properties there is less of a risk of rent collection than in a lot of downtown properties,” said Bailey, also a property owner in I.V. “Parents are, as a group, fairly wealthy, whereas in another location renters might not have the rent. A lot of people can’t mentally deal with renting to 20-year-olds, but my experience with that has been positive.”</p>\n<p>Student renters certainly present different challenges for owners and managers, said Chuck Eckert, chairman of the executive committee of the I.V. Property Owners’ Association. He cited the June and September move-in and move-out rushes as a hectic time for owners who have to prepare their properties for new renters in a very short period of time.</p>\n<p><b>Welcome to the Neighborhood</b></p>\n<p>The market forces, rental rates, community building rhetoric and decades of history piling up on the town’s sandy beaches and sometimes-paved roads don’t always trickle down to I.V.’s wards and critics. Most just cycle through to class, and cycle out of the system.</p>\n<p>Third-year business economics major Casey Bradshaw said she has been living in Isla Vista for three years and said despite the condition of most houses, she enjoys living on Sueno Road because of its location.</p>\n<p>“It’s convenient and close to campus,” Bradshaw said. “And there are a lot of parties.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year philosophy and art history major Devon Dickinson said he currently lives in Santa Maria and has never lived close to UCSB.

Bush asked to cut $192 million dollars to LANL and Sandia National Laboratories, also located in New Mexico.</p>\n<p>Finally, a Texas representative has introduced a bill that would strip the NNSA of its oversight responsibilities due to recent security breaches, and throw the future of the laboratory into even more uncertainty.</p>\n<p>And as this three-pronged attack against LANL sharpens, the lab continues with its competition against Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory – located in Northern California and also UC-managed – to oversee the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The winner will create a new nuclear weapons design to replace warhead stockpiles with less dangerous versions, and receive an undisclosed amount of funding for it.</p>\n<p>“The nuclear program is in a limbo phase,” said Andrew Culp, research and advocacy associate for the Nuclear Peace Age Foundation – a frequent critic of the labs.</p>\n<p>“The vast majority of the American population thinks we don’t need it. …Why do we still have these?”</p>\n<p>With 6,800 UC employees and 2,800 contract personnel on its payroll, LANL is hoping to answer that soon.</p>\n<p>Los Alamos National Laboratory: Nuclear Research History</p>\n<p>U.S. nuclear research began shortly after August 2, 1939, when Albert Einstein convinced President Franklin Roosevelt of Germany’s potential to create the atomic bomb. When the Japanese military attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, Roosevelt expanded the program, directing the War Dept. to develop the Manhattan Project.</p>\n<p>Research leader and UC Berkeley physics professor J. Robert Oppenheimer chose Los Alamos as the nuclear laboratory site for this operation because of its isolation.</p>\n<p>Weapons research continued into the Cold War era, but new weapon designs declined in number from the 1960s onward as the U.S. chose to focus on upgrading the current weapons stockpile and performing safety tests. Nuclear testing was later narrowed to only allow underground detonations after the U.S. and 112 other nations signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty that took effect Oct. 10, 1963. The U.S. has not performed an underground test since 1992.</p>\n<p>University of California Involvement</p>\n<p>The UC has managed LANL since 1943, receiving money from the federal government as compensation, and over the past decade LANL has formed 300 industrial partnerships worth in excess of $650 million. The University also manages two other federal research labs – the 130-acre Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and 200-acre Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p>\n<p>UC spokesman Chris Harrington said no university funding is directed toward lab management.</p>\n<p>“Student fees do not go to the labs, although the University does benefit in terms of partner research,” Harrington said. “Energy efficiency, cancer research and homeland security brings the best and brightest scientists. … That’s why the University is involved with the labs.</p>\n<p>In a May 25, 2005, statement, UC President Robert Dynes said he supports the UC contract with LANL because the University has a strong approach to science.</p>\n<p>“I’d rather be on the inside having a voice, playing a role in the decision-making, and bringing the values of good science to the institution than on the outside looking in,” Dynes said. “We will not have national security if we do not have the best science conducted by the best scientists, supported by the highest-quality research organization – which is what we have at the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Recently, the UC renewed its management contract with LANL for $512 million; however, it is no longer the sole manager as it is with LBNL and LLNL. Under the new U.S. Dept. of Energy contract, the UC and three corporations – Bechtel, BWX Technologies and Washington Group International – manage LLNL as part of a new limited liability corporation, the Los Alamos National Security LLC.</p>\n<p>The University beat out the University of Texas for the LANL contract. Texas Representative Lon Burnam criticized UT for its contract attempt last week when he submitted a new bill to the state senate on Feb. 14. If passed, the bill would ban Texas public universities from assisting in weapons research.</p>\n<p>Burnam’s Legislative Director Doug Lewin said Burnam opposes UT involvement because it places the public on the wrong side of the nuclear proliferation debate.</p>\n<p>“Public universities shouldn’t be in business of developing nuclear weapons,” Lewin said. “Public values do not include potential nuclear development. … [UT] spent several millions on consultants and traveling expenses.”</p>\n<p>Nuclear Weapon and Funding Reductions</p>\n<p>In the past five years, U.S. government officials and agencies have drafted policies to reduce nuclear weapon stockpiles and facilities, with the obvious effect of limiting the funding and growth of national laboratories like LANL.</p>\n<p>Currently, the U.S. and Russia are in agreement to reduce their nuclear arsenals to somewhere between 1,700 and 2,200 warheads by Dec. 31, 2012 as part of the Treaty for Strategic Offensive Reductions, signed by President George W. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on May 24, 2002.</p>\n<p>U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration spokesman Bryan Wilkes said the Treaty reduces the nuclear stockpile by nearly 50-percent.</p>\n<p>“It’s the lowest level since the Eisenhower administration,” Wilkes said.</p>\n<p>Wilkes said he could not disclose the current amount of nuclear warheads.</p>\n<p>In his 2008 draft budget, President Bush proposed reducing funding to LANL and Sandia National Laboratories by $192 million. Wilkes said the NNSA is also attempting to minimize costs and nuclear facility sizes with its Complex 2030 draft proposal.</p>\n<p>“[Complex 2030] reduces one-third of the budget for weapons activities,” Wilkes said. “It will make facilities more efficient and more secure.”</p>\n<p>According to an NNSA press release, components of Complex 2030 include ensuring the long-term reliability and safety of nuclear weapons stockpiles, reducing the need for underground nuclear testing, dismantling retired warheads, increasing security and establishing a consolidated plutonium center for research, development, production and surveillance operations.</p>\n<p>U.S. Dept. of Energy spokesman John Belluardo said it was premature to determine Complex 2030’s future effects as it is still in development, including the level of necessary personnel layoffs. He said the DOE and NNSA plan to present Complex 2030 for public comment this summer and then redraft the plan for presentation to Congress.</p>\n<p>Security Problems and Criticism</p>\n<p>Last month, several congressmen expressed frustration with LANL security, threatening to remove classified projects such as its plutonium pit production or even shut the lab down. LANL is the United States’ sole producer of plutonium pits.</p>\n<p>House Energy and Commerce Committee representatives simultaneously introduced a measure to bar NNSA from further LANL security governance and return direct control to DOE, putting programs such as Complex 2030 in jeopardy.</p>\n<p>Such moves come after waves of security breaches. Most recently, hundreds of classified LANL document pages saved on a personal computer were found during an October 2006 drug raid; the suspect had ties to a female LANL contract employee.</p>\n<p>In 2003, it was alleged that the UC mismanaged the lab by misallocating $15 million in government funds and allowing periodic breaches of nuclear security policy. During the 1990s, two hard drives containing classified information disappeared and were later found behind a copy machine, while another incident forced a temporary shutdown of LANL when two computer disks were thought missing. After an inventory evaluation, it was determined the disks never existed.</p>\n<p>Although Congress has yet to issue a decision regarding LANL security, LANL spokesman Kevin Roark said the lab has made several recent improvements to facility security. Roark said LANL has strengthened its fences and cyber security to prevent future computer intrusions. He also said the LANL guard force is skilled in securing the lab perimeters.</p>\n<p>“The guard force is very well-trained and well-equipped,” Roark said. “Currently, their training tactics are similar to [military] combat units.”</p>\n<p>NNSA spokesman Bryan Wilkes said the agency has conducted security evaluations and determined facility weak points. He said each facility uses different defense techniques.</p>\n<p>“[Lawrence-Livermore National Laboratories] has a gatling gun,” Wilkes said. “They are useful if you have 30 suicide terrorists. … [whereas] Los Alamos might defend differently.”</p>\n<p>He said NNSA hopes to reduce external costs and increase security funding with projects such as Complex 2030.</p>\n<p>Despite the laboratory’s efforts, anti-nuclear groups such as Santa Barbara’s Nuclear Peace Age Foundation and the Los Alamos Study Group have denounced Complex 2030 and LANL’s weapons research altogether, saying such programs set bad precedent for a country looking to establish peace with its neighbors.</p>\n<p>Andrew Culp of NPAF said Complex 2030 is an attempt to keep a failing program afloat.</p>\n<p>“Complex 2030 is just an excuse for the nuclear complex to get new money,” Culp said. “The complex is falling apart.”</p>\n<p>Culp said NNSA is using Complex 2030 to extend the lifespan of facilities such as LANL by claiming that a smaller environment is cheaper to maintain. He said the program will serve as an excuse for the labs to continue nuclear weapons development.</p>\n<p>LASG Executive Director Greg Mello also said Complex 2030 is a way for LANL to maintain longevity.</p>\n<p>“Its programs are old and stale,” Mello said. “I think Complex 2030 is a red herring and Congress and the public need to keep their eyes on the ball and work for nuclear disarmament.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The man admitted that he had made a mistake by drinking too much “cheap” vodka and apologized to officers for getting plastered.</p>\n<p>The man was booked at the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>A Flash of Brilliance Belligerence<br>\nFriday, Nov. 10, 5:20 a.m. – Officers walking by a bus stop on Camino del Sur observed a 21-year-old man lying on a bench.</p>\n<p>As a deputy approached the man, he saw that the subject’s pants were unzipped and his penis was exposed. The man was lying in a pool of urine, which streamed down the bench into a nearby gutter.</p>\n<p>The officer attempted to wake the leaky lawbreaker by shouting at the subject, but eventually had to administer a sternum rub to elicit a response.</p>\n<p>When the wiz kid woke up, he was extremely disoriented and repeatedly told officers that he lived on “Ryan Street.”</p>\n<p>Since that street does not exist anywhere near Isla Vista, the officer decided to arrest the filthy flasher for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed and left to mull over his own mess, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>All I Want to Do Is Bicycle!!!<br>\nSaturday, Nov. 25, 9:15 p.m. – Deputies were patrolling the 6700 block of El Colegio Road when they saw a 22-year-old man zoom past them on a bicycle.</p>\n<p>As the subject sped past the officers, he fell off the bike and flew through the air, before ultimately crashing on to the pavement. He stumbled for several yards before regaining his balance.</p>\n<p>In a rage, the man picked up his bike and threw it to the ground. He then flopped down on to the street, where he sat, pouting, until an officer approached him.</p>\n<p>The deputy detected a strong odor of alcohol and noticed that the surly cyclist’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy. When the officer began questioning the subject, the man attempted to answer -but only managed to say, “I live at 555… ah… I’m not sure.”</p>\n<p>Despite the commendable effort to remember where he lived, the man was completely oblivious to his surroundings and could not even stand up. To ensure the man’s own safety, the officer arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The subject was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
