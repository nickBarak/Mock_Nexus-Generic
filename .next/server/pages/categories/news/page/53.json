The bill passed its final vote in the California State Senate on Aug. 30, 2018.</p>\n<p>The bill would have required all University of California and California State University campuses to offer the pills by Jan. 1, 2022, including UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It is the intent of the Legislature that public university student health centers make abortion by medication techniques as accessible and cost-effective for students as possible, and thus public university student health centers should treat abortion by medication techniques as a basic health service,” according to the bill’s text.</p>\n<p>The<em> Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/abortion-pill-clears-hurdle-on-path-to-public-universities/#search\">previously reported</a> that The National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a non-partisan council, released a report on March 16 that confirmed that the Mifeprex pill is safe and effective.</p>\n<p>Support for this bill came largely from the Women’s Foundation and the Tara Health Foundation. The two foundations <a href=\"http://justcarecalifornia.org/press/national-academies-of-sciences-report-on-abortion-context-experts-on-sb-320/\">helped fund</a> the implementation of SB 320 into public universities.</p>\n<p>“We are disappointed that Gov. Brown failed to support what the Senate, the Assembly, and 6 in 10 Californians already have recognized in this groundbreaking bill — that students of California need abortion care on campus,” Surina Khan, the CEO of The Women’s Foundation of California, said in a <a href=\"https://womensfoundca.org/news/governor-brown-vetoes-campus-abortion-bill/\">press release</a>.</p>\n<p>“We choose to listen to students, not those in power who continually deny their reproductive rights.

It had been located at 971 Embarcadero Del Mar for 14 years and at 6578 Trigo Road for eight years before that, according to Alfonso Espino, Hempwise owner.</p>\n<p>“We were really all about kind of being a hub for the community and… being there for people who are interested in these types of things, especially alternative resources,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Hempwise closed its location in I.V. because their lease was not renewed by the owners of the lot. Espino hopes to move the shop to a new location in I.V. or Goleta.</p>\n<p>“[We have] been kind of scrambling for a new location and haven’t been able to find anything in I.V., but hopefully we’ll find something soon,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Hempwise had their last business day this past Monday and will be completely out of the building by the end of this month. Espino is still unsure when or where he will be able to open a new location.</p>\n<p><strong>SORRISO ITALIANO</strong></p>\n<p>The authentic Italian stop at 901 Embarcadero Del Mar closed in early June of this year, ending five years of business in I.V. with a wine tasting party.</p>\n<p>The owners, Antonio and Elisabetta Gerli, worked together in the restaurant, dividing the work between themselves. The long shifts and time taken away from family was a significant reason for closing, according to Antonio.</p>\n<p>“There are different reasons, but I think the most important was that my wife was the chef and I was in the front so we worked like 14 hours a day and we have a family,” Antonio said.</p>\n<p>Sorriso also catered frequently for events for the UCSB Athletic Department.</p>\n<p>The couple recently accepted positions at Due Lune Cucina, an Italian restaurant in Santa Barbara. Antonio now works there as a manager and Elisabetta as executive chef. While they are enjoying the benefits of a lighter schedule, Antonio still reminisces on their time in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I miss Isla Vista because that was a great environment and good vibe, but you know, sometimes… you need to change your chapter of your life and we did it,” Gerli said.</p>\n<p><strong>KAPTAIN’S FIREHOUSE BBQ</strong></p>\n<p>Once wedged between Study Hall and Varsity Bike Shop at 6543 Pardall Road, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ shut down its location during UC Santa Barbara’s winter break in 2017.</p>\n<p>When it opened back in 2013, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ was a division of a larger company which also caters to festivals and large venues among other events.</p>\n<p>Despite its popularity in the early years as well as in other divisions of the company, the loss of popularity at the location in I.V. was a factor in its closure, according to Michael “The Kaptain” Gould, owner of the company.</p>\n<p>“For the first three years, we rocked it. We did really really really well. It was the last two years where it just became kind of stagnant,” The Kaptain said. “We made a couple changes to the menu, but it was kind of that I.V. rotation of restaurants that come through and it seemed like we had our run.”</p>\n<p>After expansions and growing success in the other divisions of his company, The Kaptain decided to close down the location in I.V. to concentrate on his other projects.</p>\n<p>“The easier thing to do would be to close I.V. and focus on, you know, where all our money was at.”</p>\n<p>The Kaptain recently opened a new division of his company which serves cold brew coffee and micro-brews at events, along with ribs, grilled wings and corn that was emblematic of the shack.</p>\n<p><em>Hiwi Tropical Fusion and Juice It Up, The Grilled Cheese Truck Stop and Rincon Brewery could not be reached for comment.</em></p>\n<p>While these businesses are closing their doors, new ones such as Hanamura on Embarcadero Del Mar, One Piece on Pardall Street and California Tacos and Taproom on Embarcadero del Norte have eagerly moved into their places.</p>\n<p><strong>CALIFORNIA TACOS AND TAPROOM</strong></p>\n<p>The fourth location of the Mexican fusion taco joint California Tacos and Taproom moved in the lot formerly occupied by The Grilled Cheese Truck Stop in August. Alex Uribe, the owner of the company, said he will be adding elements specifically designed for the demographic in Isla Vista, including televisions, 12 to 16 brews on tap and enhanced outdoor seating areas.</p>\n<p>“I think what was lacking before was a little bit of personality,” Uribe said. “I think that the students are looking for a good place to hang out, to have good food, a good atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>Uribe is confident that the atmosphere of the restaurant and items of the menu will draw popularity to a notoriously unsuccessful property in I.V.</p>\n<p>Uribe, a UCSB alum, will also have his son, a current UCSB student, managing the restaurant and providing a student perspective on the business.</p>\n<p>“I used to go to UCSB a long time ago so I’m a little familiar with the area and although everything you know changes and evolves, I think I have a little bit better understanding than a regular person would come in and didn’t come to the school.”</p>\n<p>Uribe estimates California Tacos and Taproom will officially open around October 15 of this year.</p>\n<p><em>Hanamura and One Piece could not be reached for comment.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

He was hired by UCSB in July after the previous director left following a series of controversies.</p>\n<p>The RCSGD experienced an upset during Fall Quarter 2017 when the center split from its umbrella organization, the Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity Department (WGSE), after its associate director Ale Muro was fired and escorted out of the building by police.</p>\n<p>RCSGD student staffers then presented a list of demands to the university, contending that they should be allowed their own autonomy in the form of a dedicated center as well an increase in funding, among other points.</p>\n<p>“I hope the school, in choosing the new director, really understood our concerns that we had the last time around, and really brought those to the hiring process this year to make sure that it won’t happen again,” said Associated Students Internal Vice President Steven Ho, who as a senator authored a resolution last year calling for the resignation of the previous director.</p>\n<p>Hikaru Ezra Mernin, who was the primary author of the demands, said the center is still suffering from a lack of trust between queer students and the RCSGD last year.</p>\n<p>“At the beginning of last year, we had several hundred [visitors]. That dropped to 50 when we had a staffing collapse, and now we have a couple dozen a day… we don’t see a lot of foot traffic,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Even within the center, student organizations and student staffer-led projects “fell apart” because students had to focus instead on keeping the center afloat.</p>\n<p>Mernin listed the Emerging Leadership Institute, a retreat for emerging queer leaders to foster leadership capabilities, and Society for Accessible and Safe Spaces (SASS), a trans-focused social organization, as two casualties of last year.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to get back on track now, but it’s very much a period of healing and rebuilding for our community,” they said.</p>\n<p>Mernin said they hope that Leets’s presence brings a security to the center that would allow the RCSGD to build itself back up.</p>\n<p>Leets himself came into his position fully aware of last year’s strife and wants to work with students to make amends.</p>\n<p>“If there are students who have ideas about things that the RCSGD should be doing, or ways that we can rebuild trust or mend relationships that may have been harmed or broken last year, I would love to hear from those folks,” he said.</p>\n<p>Leets specializes in LGBTQ advocacy in higher education and has had stints at PSU and Penn State University working to make sure that LGBTQ students do not face barriers at universities due to their identity.</p>\n<p>At PSU, he worked to implement a new building code that required all new and majorly renovated buildings to host all-gender, multi-stall restrooms. Leets also highlighted his efforts to make it easier for students at PSU to be recognized by their preferred names.</p>\n<p>“[We made it] so those students who don’t want to interface with their legal name don’t have to,” he said.</p>\n<p>At UCSB, Leets is working on a similar initiative that would allow students to input their own pronouns in the university system. It would then be visible on course rosters and other university databases, allowing for students to be addressed with their proper pronouns by faculty and administrators.</p>\n<p>Although there is no set timeline for its implementation yet, Leets anticipates the changes to hit campus during this academic year.</p>\n<p>There are high expectations in place for Leets as he works to return the center to the safe haven it originally was for queer students.</p>\n<p>“I came to UCSB because of the vibrancy and the cohesiveness of the queer community on campus, and very little of what I saw coming in is left,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Mernin says students expect the center to be more open to student input in the future and increase outreach to previously underserved communities, listing “black students, undocumented students, disabled students, lesbian students, students of faith, ACE and ARO students and intersex students.” They also want to make resources available for faculty members and graduate students.</p>\n<p>Leets seems interested in doing exactly that.</p>\n<p>“I’m just excited to continue on the legacy of other folks, particularly student activists and advocates who have done work in the past,” Leets said. “The center really has a rich legacy and LGBTQ students have been advocating on campus since the 50s, so I am just excited to be here and just continue the work that others have started.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-84068\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The bicycles can be unlocked using the HOPR app. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p>The latest addition to the UCSB and I.V. communities – courtesy of the start-up company HOPR and complete with the tagline “Hop around UCSB” – first appeared over a month ago.</p>\n<p>James Wagner, program manager for UCSB’s Transportation Alternatives Program, said bike sharing has been on UCSB’s radar “for at least a dozen years.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of students will buy a bike maybe used for $50, or maybe a new bike for close to $100,” Wagner said. “For a similar kind of dollars you can use a bike that is easy to use, has three speeds … if something happens to the bike after you lock it, it’s not on you anymore.”</p>\n<p>CycleHop LLC, HOPR’s parent company, launched the HOPR-transit mobile app in Spring 2018, according to the company’s website.</p>\n<p>The HOPR bicycles are equipped with a “smart bike share system,” meaning that anyone can use the bicycles as long as they have the app on their smartphone. Users can also report problems with the bicycle through the app.</p>\n<p>The first official steps toward bringing a bicycle sharing program to campus first began three years ago, said Mo Lovegreen, UCSB’s campus sustainability director.</p>\n<p>“A board was formed that included UCSB, the County of Santa Barbara, the City of Santa Barbara, the Santa Barbara Waterfront, SBCC, SBCAG, MTD, the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition [and] the City of Goleta,” Lovegreen said in an email.</p>\n<p>The group agreed UCSB should take the lead on the program, include Isla Vista and then expand into the cities of Goleta and Santa Barbara down the road, according to Wagner.</p>\n<p>UCSB then received proposals from eight bicycle-sharing companies looking to set up in the area, Lovegreen said.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Bikes and a number of students on campus participated in developing the scoring rubric for the proposals as well as the bikes, they also test-rode the bikes, and were part of the decision making body for the vendor,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>HOPR’s “no cost” offer was what ultimately sealed the deal. The company said it would shoulder the full cost of the program, which would have otherwise costed the university around $1.5 million dollars for the initial start-up.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84080\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84080\" data-attachment-id=\"84080\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/hopping-into-the-new-school-year-hopr-bike-share-has-arrived/hopr-app/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hopr app\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84080\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84080\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Users can locate bicycles and their “pods” on the HOPR app. <em>Courtesy of HOPR app</em></p></div>\n<p>HOPR signed a three-year-long contract in early May 2019, according to Callie Price, UCSB’s purchasing and contracts manager. The contract can be extended before it expires.</p>\n<p>Each bike normally costs somewhere between $1,500 and $5,000, Wagner said.</p>\n<p>“For dock bikes, there are dock costs, and then there’s transaction fees for the credit cards and maintenance and all sorts of things,” Wagner said.</p>\n<p>The first 1,000 students who sign for the annual membership with their UCSB email – and also qualify for financial aid through UCSB – will receive half the membership money back into their Billing Accounts Receivable Collection (BARC).</p>\n<p>The bicycle sharing program is also an added bonus to a campus where over 1,500 bicycles are abandoned every year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a waste problem in terms of abandoned bikes,” Wagner said. “We do sell some of them; the CSOs do a sale at the third week of every quarter in order to put some of those bikes back into service, but usually they only sell a 150 back to the students.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe, as people use more and more bike share bikes, there will be fewer bikes abandoned.”</p>\n<p>HOPR plans to add more than 900 additional bicycles to the UCSB and I.V. area by January 2019, according to Wagner. Eventually, “upgraded” bicycles, such those with electric pedals, will be integrated into the campus.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our students ride bikes at night without any lights or reflectors, or anything else.

Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Zaveeni Khan-Marcus, who has been the director for the MultiCultural Center (MCC) since its founding, is the “heart and soul” of the center, according to Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life.</p>\n<p>Armistead works with the center in an administrative capacity and has known Khan-Marcus since they were both undergraduate students at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), when the center was first introduced.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of history with Zaveeni and I and with me watching the center grow,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>The MCC was a small room on the other side of campus when it was first founded in 1987 after students of color protested their lack of inclusion within the university. When the University Center expansion was commissioned in 1994, the organization’s current space by Ortega Dining Commons was created.</p>\n<p>Now the center holds a theater, a meeting room and lounge. While the MCC has suffered from limited funding, it has been able to maintain its 24-25 programs each quarter while also increasing the scale on which it operates.</p>\n<p>“Last quarter, we had Kimberle Crenshaw who gave a talk at Campbell Hall, and even though Campbell Hall holds only about 800 seats, we had 1,200 people who showed up for that event,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>She sees this as tangible proof there is demand, and an expectation, for the MCC to continue to host speakers or put on events that create a “platform for conversation about race, class, social justice [and] equality.”</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also works with faculty to create awareness on campus; some faculty members even offer extra credit to students who attend these events.</p>\n<p>The spaces within the MCC are also open to cultural organizations affiliated with the center, which often host meetings or events there.</p>\n<p>“We provide opportunities for UCSB students [to immerse themselves in] other cultural experiences. MCC is definitely the best place to provide such international and cultural communications,” said Takafumi Igarashi, director of social activities for the International Student Association.</p>\n<p>Beyond its existence as an event space, the MCC is focused on giving voice to students.</p>\n<p>“Throughout our 30-year existence currently, centralizing the students is one of the most important things we do,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>The MCC is led by a board of students, staff and faculty. Student representatives come from various cultural organizations that are affiliated with the center.</p>\n<p>“They come together and they have conversations, inform us about what their needs are, but also represent to the campus the needs of … the marginalized students,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>These students are able to have challenging conversations and come together to support each other and advance student activism during a difficult campus climate, according to Armistead.</p>\n<p>While the MCC is typically known as a home away from home for students of color, the center has also opened itself up to transgender students on campus with its Trans* Initiative.</p>\n<p>“In the last couple of years, transgender students have felt comfortable with this space … so that’s saying a lot – it’s a huge statement that they feel comfortable within the walls of this center,” said Khan-Marcus.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing resources and working with the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to make UCSB a more inclusive campus, the MCC hosts weekly meetings for “all trans folks and supportive allies,” according to its website.</p>\n<p>However, while the MCC is entering its 30th year of existence, this center is not the norm nationwide.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge statement, that UCSB has had a MultiCultural Center for 30 years. A lot of my colleagues from other campuses feel strongly that this MultiCultural Center is a very important, transformative space,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Other universities trying to follow in UCSB’s footsteps might face pushback from administration or minimal funding and staffing because multicultural centers are identity-based spaces, but Khan-Marcus advises them to continuously advocate for their students.</p>\n<p>“Social justice work is challenging, because it’s not easy work, but it’s absolutely needed at every campus. Even in this day and age, if you go and talk to some students of color, they will share with you that at times that they feel invisible at UCSB,” she said.</p>\n<p>For Lily Pham, Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) co-president, it is heartening to know that there’s someone out there who cares about centers like the MCC.</p>\n<p>“There’s some statistic that if you look it up, it’ll say we’re pretty up there in diversity. But that’s not always prevalent when you’re just walking around and seeing, at a face value, what the campus is,” Pham said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Sept. 20 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

renewable energy sources. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>On Sept. 4, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) announced in a press release that this “expansion of its system-wide sustainability goals” was a part of the UC’s Carbon Neutrality Initiative.</p>\n<p>The Carbon Neutrality Initiative began in 2013, when UC President Janet Napolitano proposed the goal of making the UCs a zero net energy consumer by 2025.</p>\n<p>Along with the 2013 commitment to become carbon neutral, UC now also aims for “100 percent reliance on clean electricity suppliers across its campuses and medical centers by 2025,” according to the press release.</p>\n<p>UC has already saved $220 million by utilizing its energy efficiency programs.</p>\n<p>At UC Santa Barbara, students have been working on the 100 Percent Campaign for the past two years, according to Adriana Munoz, the vice chair of UCSB’s California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) branch.</p>\n<p>“CALPIRG Students have been working very hard to create buzz about renewable energy by talking to thousands of students about this issue and signing them up as members to our organization,” Munoz said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also worked with other student organizations as well as with faculty to show overall campus support for this issue.”</p>\n<p>She added that the campaign has been a priority due to the effects of climate change on California, which include fires that have occurred close to UCSB’s campus, such as the Thomas Fire, the second largest fire in the state’s history.</p>\n<p>“We are so proud that our UC system is working with students in order to take more steps towards a clean energy future and CALPIRG Students looks forward to working with them on this issue further,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>UC is also committed to not using on-site fossil fuel combustion for new buildings and renovations after June 2019, as well as reducing its overall energy-use intensity, the press release said.</p>\n<p>The UC commitment precedes Governor Jerry Brown’s signing of Senate Bill 100 on Sept. 10.</p>\n<p>SB 100, authored by State Senator Kevin de León, requires the state of California to use 100-percent renewable and zero-carbon electricity sources by 2045.</p>\n<p>“With Governor Brown’s order, California establishes the most ambitious carbon neutrality commitment of any major economic jurisdiction in the world,” a press release from Gov.

the way that students are supported and included contributes to their academic and professional success.</p>\n<p>The Nexus interviewed several directors of Student Affairs departments and found that the university’s main success comes from bolstering the student body; from the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) to Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.), the university’s programs help foster a healthy environment.</p>\n<p>However, problems also stem from rising enrollment rates, which have left university resource programs struggling to provide for a student body that increases by several hundred students each year.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jones, director of EOP, said the needs of students will always exceed the department’s abilities to meet those needs, which consistently leaves departments in a game of catch-up.</p>\n<p>“Student Affairs … [has] for decades struggled to keep up with the resources needed to provide for the services the students have either needed, or quite frankly demanded,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Even when departments can predict an influx of students, it is still difficult to prepare for the one-on-one services they might require, said Gary White, director of the Disabled Students Program (DSP).</p>\n<p>“I think we’re [servicing] about maybe six percent of our student population and we know the national average is almost 11, 10.9 percent,” White said.</p>\n<p>“We know that they’re coming … and we want to have the resources, the firepower, the systems in place so that we can handle when that onslaught comes.</p>\n<p>One of the DSP’s most common services is providing alternate testing locations for students during their midterms and finals, which can be difficult given the disproportionate amount of classrooms and labs on campus compared to the number of students, according to White.</p>\n<p>“It’s just one of those things where we don’t have time to gripe about ‘oh, this is a roadblock,’ it’s just like ‘alright, we gotta make it a speed bump’ and still keep going forward,” White said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is legally mandated to ensure that all students have equal access to educational opportunities on campus, so any failure of the DSP to do so would leave the university open to lawsuits.</p>\n<p>As the campus continues to grow, several Student Affairs departments cite concerns about being able to service their students.</p>\n<p>For instance, C.A.R.E. – an unusual department at UCSB, as most college campuses don’t dedicate entire offices to student advocacy – Director Brianna Conway said her staffers still find it difficult to always have someone available for a student because of how many students they serve.</p>\n<p>Jones also noted a similar problem with the EOP office.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to have to be more mindful of managing time and resources to be as efficient as possible while not losing out on quality or our ability to be able to connect individually with students,” he said.</p>\n<p>These problems are the result of minimal funding, a key problem within the University of California system.</p>\n<p>“Funding is always an issue,” White said. “We’re getting as much as we can.”</p>\n<p>White does his best to “keep folks abreast of the numbers” and continually updates the vice chancellor’s office as enrollment in DSP increases throughout the school year.</p>\n<p>Despite these difficulties, White believes DSP offers students who wouldn’t traditionally attend university the opportunity to succeed.</p>\n<p>“We know that if someone is qualified to come, there needs to be space for them to be here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Several departments in the division of Student Affairs highlight the importance of providing students with a sense of belonging, which in turn can help students succeed academically.</p>\n<p>“Research shows that a student is more academically successful and happier when they feel like they belong in a place,” said Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of Student Life.</p>\n<p>Armistead overlooks the cluster of Student Affairs departments that revolve around student life, particularly the Office of Student Life (OSL). OSL focuses on fraternity and sorority life, registered organizations and leadership development.</p>\n<p>While Armistead feels the OSL has strengthened its relationship with fraternities and sororities in recent years, she now wants to turn attention to registered organizations on campus.</p>\n<p>With the recent hire of campus organizations coordinator Justin Littleton, a recent UCSB graduate and former OSL intern, Armistead hopes to see memberships in registered organizations grow with the dedicated attention Littleton will be providing.</p>\n<p>Armistead also prides herself on the “one-stop shop” aspect of the OSL.</p>\n<p>“People come to us for so many different things and what we try never to do is ‘Oh we don’t do that here.’ We try to at least connect students to where they need to be. We’ll pick up the phone, or we’ll even Google it for them so they don’t have to leave feeling like ‘Well now what do I do?’ ” she said.</p>\n<p>As head of C.A.R.E., Conway also sees the same duty as an essential part of her job.</p>\n<p>“I always like to think of it as we’re like a hub of the wheel, so the student doesn’t have to navigate all of these [campus entities] by themselves,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway and her staff work as direct service providers for students, staff and faculty who are dealing with sexual assault, domestic violence or stalking.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E.’s main office is located in the Women’s Center in the Student Resource Building (SRB); however, the office established a second location in Isla Vista two years ago in order to make itself more accessible to all students.</p>\n<p>“Not everyone wants to walk into the women’s center –– what about our male survivors? Or LGBTQ students that … come here for other spaces or events … to come and receive services might not feel as comfortable,” she said.</p>\n<p>Conway also notes the lack of graduate students who approach the C.A.R.E. office for assistance.</p>\n<p>“I think sometimes grad students don’t feel like there’s a place for them, or that the services aren’t for them or aren’t tailored for them,” she said.</p>\n<p>The C.A.R.E. office has grown since Conway first started in 2013, from three full-time staff members and one part-time staff member to an office of eight full-time staff members and several interns.</p>\n<p>The inclusion of student interns on staff has helped to bring student insight to the office, Conway said.</p>\n<p>The EOP office also relies on a similar peer-to-peer model in developing a sense of belonging for its students, who are primarily, but not exclusively, first-generation students and come from low socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“EOP’s mission and history is our ability over the many years to be able to have both a collective and an individual connection to students, and that’s certainly made a difference in my undergraduate career and as a professional staff person. Sometimes for a student at a particular point in life, that [connection] makes all the difference,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>While most students develop that sense of belonging through campus organizations, Associated Students (A.S.) President Brooke Kopel wants to help students who aren’t involved in organizations feel at home on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our student government, our administrators, our faculty need to be the ones who are making sure students, regardless of whatever they’re involved in, feel welcomed on campus, feel like they can get help when they need it,” she said.</p>\n<p>Kopel says that although there is always room for improvement, the university “has the best intentions in mind for its students, even when it falls short at times.”</p>\n<p>She believes what makes UCSB great is the pressure from students on the university over the years to make it more inclusive and supportive of its population.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons why … the EOP exists is because students in the mid-60s were demanding that there be some sort of place or home for students who have otherwise been denied access historically to public higher education at colleges and universities,” Jones added.</p>\n<p>Jones cites <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/one-year-later-el-centro-reopens-its-doors/\">El Centro</a> in particular as a pivotal space for Chicanx students, faculty and community members who find value and comfort in their shared history.</p>\n<p>“These spaces have provided a home away from home for first-generation college students whose parents may not necessarily have been able to prepare them for what it’s like to go into a college environment,” he said.</p>\n<p>As UCSB continues to support its students academically, Jones hopes the university also sees the value of the holistic support Student Affairs provides in its “direct and immediate” impact on students.</p>\n<p>“The need is there, so I think the challenge is how best we can [support our students] with the resources we have, with the needs that are always gonna exceed the resources.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Sept. 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

They were eventually able to make contact with two detainees who had access to a cellphone while the protestors were gathered. The groups exchanged greetings and hopeful sentiments.</p>\n<p>“They said ‘Thank you.’ Just ‘Thank you’ that we remember them, that we gave them time … that we came,” Rodríguez said.“We said to them, you know, ‘Have faith that there is someone here that thinks about you everyday, if nothing else, that you’re not disappeared.’”</p>\n<p>Un Llanto Colectivo is the first major action that Las Maestras Center has organized since its opening in March of this year. The faculty currently consists of Rodríguez, a lecturer on campus, and Cherrie Moraga, a professor in the English Department at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The group, which stems from the English Department at UCSB, aims to educate students and preserve the thought, traditions and culture of indigenous communities, according to its website.</p>\n<p>“Indigenous thought has been fragmented, punctured, disengaged, decontextualized, made into these little kind of exotic things. [Las] Maestras center wanted to bring [indigenous thought] back into focus,” Rodríguez said.</p>\n<p>With initial funding they received from UCSB, Rodríguez hopes to continue to expand Las Maestras through developing programs, hiring interns and developing a voice on campus. In the six months since opening, Las Maestras has already begun to connect with other groups seeking collaborations.</p>\n<p>Rodríguez stresses the importance of individuals to stay active in their communities and pay attention to the social and political issues happening around them.</p>\n<p>“Unless you stop injustice, it will continue to roll and eventually you’re gonna feel it,” Rodríguez said. “We have to keep vigilant and keep active. I think that’s an important piece of it, you know, because it’s not over.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Sept. 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

County Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies were initially dispatched to the area around midnight after one of several victims reported that the suspects drove through the 6600 block of Picasso Road and the 700 block of Camino Del Sur, shooting out of a car window.</p>\n<p>The unnamed victim who reported the incident was shot in his chest, arms and legs and was left with welts, IVFP Lieutenant Daniel Calderon said.</p>\n<p>As deputies searched the surrounding areas, looking for the car described, they found the vehicle with the four suspects inside. A paintball gun could be seen “in plain view” by the feet of one of the rear passengers, according to Calderon.</p>\n<p>Deputies later found a bag of paintballs in the vehicle and a paintball in one passenger’s pocket while conducting inventory.</p>\n<p>“The seriousness of the case is due to the potential for injury, such as striking a victim in the face, near the eyes, or other soft tissue which could cause severe injury,” Calderon said in an email.</p>\n<p>Three of the suspects, Bell, Russell and Couillard, are students, according to Santa Barbara County Jail custody logs. Gude’s occupation is listed as “sandwich maker.”</p>\n<p>It is unknown at this time which schools the aforementioned three attend.</p>\n<p>The men are currently in custody at the Santa Barbara County Jail on $30,000 bails.</p>\n<p>Any person with information about this incident is asked to call 805-681-4179 or leave an anonymous tip <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/home/anonymous-tip/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Within seconds, Yokota quickly received likes, comments and messages in response to her post.</p>\n<p>“For some reason it just blew up like crazy, so quickly, too. The second I posted it, my phone was blowing up with messages and notifications.”</p>\n<p>At the time of the <em>Nexus</em>’ interview with Yokota, there were a total of 73 members in the GroupMe for Coast Carvers and approximately 100 people who had contacted Yokota about her post, from newcomers to I.V. to experienced skaters to parents asking Yokota to teach their own kids how to skate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83848\" style=\"width: 1368px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83848\" data-attachment-id=\"83848\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/coast-carvers-hit-the-streets-of-isla-vista/unnamed-2-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1358%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1358,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83848\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C1339\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1339\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1358&amp;ssl=1 1358w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1158&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 679w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83848\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Masaki Osato</em></p></div>\n<p>Yokota founded the group after taking interest in a similar female skating group based out of Venice Beach called GRLSWRL, which is “a modern-retro all-female stoke-chasing community focused on bringing femininity… to the male dominated skate scene,” according to the group’s website.</p>\n<p>Yokota was never able to attend one of GRLSWRL’s bi-weekly scheduled skate sessions, but from meeting up for casual skate sessions with some of the members, she felt that I.V. would provide the ideal space for a group with similar purposes.<br>\n“It’s something that Isla Vista kind of needed, but nobody knew it needed that,” Yokota said.</p>\n<p>Although they have similar missions, the two groups hold some key differences, such as Coast Carvers’ inclusion of “anything that shreds in I.V.,” namely roller-skating and surfing in addition to skating. Yokota says this inclusion is ideal for their group given the diversity of sports and hobbies practiced by girls in I.V.</p>\n<p>Yokota also notes variations in the general energy and mood of the two skate groups, which she attributes to the differences of the locations that each group call home.</p>\n<p>“[In Venice] there’s just a bunch of random people and strangers and it’s really crowded, it’s kind of stressful,” Yokota said. “But then when I skated on DP, it was a Sunday evening and I just had my nine girls with me, and it was just really peaceful honestly.”</p>\n<p>Being a girl in the world of skating can prove to be intimidating for many people, she said. The seemingly overwhelming proportion of men to women who skate can make it difficult for women feel confident attending skateparks and the like, but skating in groups like Coast Carvers can afford them a sense of support and companionship, according to Yokota.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to full-send something when you’re just scared… so having girls around you just kind of builds your confidence,” Yokota said. “I don’t want girls to feel like they can’t do things just because they are girls or because there aren’t enough girls doing something.”</p>\n<p>Yokota is hopeful that Coast Carvers will continue to grow once the academic year begins. At that time, she plans to have scheduled skate sessions during the week and wants to eventually create an executive board to help run the club.</p>\n<p>Depending on the success of the group in the next year, Yokota has also been toying with the idea of expanding Coast Carvers into a multi-chapter organization in order to create a network of girl skaters both locally and regionally.</p>\n<p>“That’s what called out to me, is that I could be a part of something bigger.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
