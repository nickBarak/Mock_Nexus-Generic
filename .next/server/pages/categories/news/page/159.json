He also could not explain why he was hosing down his neighbor’s deck with urine.</p>\n<p>Then the man got pissed off. He began calling the deputies “motherfuckers” and started ranting incoherently about the movie “Super Troopers.”</p>\n<p>Taking a cue from the film, officers put the man in his place – jail – after arresting him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Sunday, Nov. 5, 1:43 a.m. – An officer patrolling the 6600 block of DP observed an 18-year-old man leaning on a vehicle in a driveway.</p>\n<p>The man was loudly announcing, “I love my parents.”</p>\n<p>The inebriated freshman – who was apparently a little more than homesick – could not maintain his balance without help, which led the deputy to conclude that the man was intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The subjects accompanying the delinquent told officers they did not know the tanked teen, and could not take him home to the Santa Rosa Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>For the man’s safety, the officer arrested him for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Friday, Oct. 27, 12:48 a.m. – Officers were alerted to a fight while standing at the intersection of DP and Camino Pescadero.</p>\n<p>The deputies found two women wrestling on the sidewalk, as a third woman attempted to break up the brouhaha.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as the two pulled the other’s hair and slap at each other before ending the scuffle.</p>\n<p>After checking the women for injuries, the deputies arrested the disorderly women for disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p>An officer began searching the subjects’ belongings, and was going through the 20-year-old woman’s purse when he found pot inside.</p>\n<p>When he showed the woman the illegal substance, the stoner bluntly said, “I wish I had some marijuana right now.”</p>\n<p>After hearing this, the officer arrested the woman for public intoxication, and dragged her into the patrol car where the subject’s smoldering temper got the best of her.</p>\n<p>As the fiending offender was transported to jail, she repeatedly kicked the plexiglass shield in the patrol car with her red, heeled shoes, causing over $200 in damage.</p>\n<p>The woman was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail, and housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While doing so, the officer noticed the man’s balance was unsteady and he reeked of alcohol.</p>\n<p>The deputy informed the man he was under arrest, and the subject told the officer, “It’s cool, homie.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication, and he was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Don’t Judge a Book by Its Cover<br>\nSaturday, Sept. 30, 1:04 a.m. – Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw two 17-year-old women stagger westbound down the street.</p>\n<p>One woman was making it down the street by bouncing off every three or four cars as the other subject was practically carried by a doting gentleman.</p>\n<p>An officer contacted the trashed trio and placed the car hopper on the curb for her safety. He began questioning the seemingly caring couple, but to everyone’s surprise – including the drunken duo’s – the pair did not know each other.</p>\n<p>The officer sent the man away, and attempted to find out where the girls were planning to stay for the night. Both of the subjects said they could not remember who their friends in I.V. were or where they lived.</p>\n<p>The officer decided the women were both too intoxicated to care for their safety or the safety of others and placed them under arrest for public intoxication. Upon hearing the charge, one of the women corrected the officer, saying she was not drunk – she had only smoked marijuana.</p>\n<p>Since getting stoned and staying out after curfew are still illegal in California, the officer transported both women to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where they were booked, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-12033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-12033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/","id":454,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[453,452,451],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2006-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Oh No He Di'int\nSaturday, Sept. 23, 1:54 a.m. - Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive stopped at a residence when they heard a man and woman arguing loudly behind a fence.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Oh No He Di’int<br>\nSaturday, Sept. 23, 1:54 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive stopped at a residence when they heard a man and woman arguing loudly behind a fence.</p>\n<p>The deputies listened for several minutes and could clearly hear a female voice repeatedly ask a man to leave the house because “you don’t disrespect people in their own home.”</p>\n<p>The woman asked the 21-year-old subject to leave several times, but he did not comply.

While watching the fire, the officers observed an unidentified male approach and kick the frame, causing half of it to fall away from the fire and continue smoking.</p>\n<p>The officers then observed a 24-year-old male walk up, lift up part of the frame and throw it back onto the fire. The officers contacted the suspect and placed him under arrest for fueling a fire.</p>\n<p>While returning to the IVFP station, the suspect apologized for fueling the fire and told the officers, “This was a stupid thing to do,” and “I was trying to impress a girl.” When the officers told the suspect they were going to be completely honest with him, he said, “Since you are being honest with me, I want to be honest with you; I have some marijuana in my jacket pocket.”</p>\n<p>Upon arrival at the IVFP station, the officers recovered a clear plastic baggie of marijuana from the suspect’s left-side jacket pocket.</p>\n<p>The suspect was issued a citation for fueling a fire and possession of less than one ounce of marijuana. He was cited and released; the marijuana was taken as evidence.</p>\n<p><b>Close Only Counts in Horseshoes and Hand Grenades</b><br>\nAt approximately 12:05 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 17, IVFP officers patrolling the intersection of Camino del Sur and Sabado Tarde Road observed a 19-year-old male staggering westbound on Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP reports, as the suspect was walking, he picked up a plastic cup in the roadway and threw it at the vehicle driving on Camino del Sur, just missing it. When the officers contacted the suspect, they noticed he had red watery eyes, an unsteady gait and a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his person.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Goodness Gracious, Great Ball of Fire</b><br>\nAt approximately 1:50 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 18, IVFP officers patrolling the 6500 block of Pardall Road observed a ball 8 inches in diameter, made of a metal frame covered in cloth, on fire in the middle of the road.</p>\n<p>Reports state the officers saw a 21-year-old male walk up to the ball, grab it, spin it in a circle several times and throw it, causing flaming cloth and debris to be flung into the street.</p>\n<p>When confronted by the officers, the suspect said, “I was just moving it out of the street.” The ball was still in the middle of the street and was no closer to being out of the road.</p>\n<p>The fire department responded and put out the fire. When the officers asked the suspect why, if he wanted to help, he did not call the fire department, the suspect said, “I’m not obligated to.” The suspect had red watery eyes, and was confused when given simple instructions.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><i>– Compiled from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Reports by Jennifer B.
