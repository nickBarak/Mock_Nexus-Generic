The tax would add an additional 8 percent surcharge to five utilities on I.V. residents’ bills: electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services.</p>\n<p>In a report presented at a special meeting on Tuesday, the Community Services District (CSD) presented its first revenue projections. The CSD arrived at the figures by calculating eight percent of all I.V. bills in 2017 for the five utilities.</p>\n<p>Dividing that amount by the number of I.V. residents, 23,096 <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217\">according to the 2010 census</a>, means that individuals will each have to pay approximately $30.41 annually.</p>\n<p>The tax figures originally projected the CSD would accrue $834,993, though additional deductions the CSD is still considering would drop the number to $702,444.</p>\n<p>There are two specific deductions the CSD is considering: a state-owned exemption which amounts to $7,300 and a low-income exemption which totals $125,249 of tax savings for residents.</p>\n<p>A low-income exemption would excuse residents from paying the 8 percent tax on gas, water and electricity.</p>\n<p>Residents would be able to qualify for the exemption by providing proof they are enrolled in the California Alternate Rates for Energy or Family Electric Rate Assistance programs. They would also need proof they own the electricity utility account enrolled in the assistance program.</p>\n<p>In order to apply for the exemption, residents would have to file an application with the general manager of the CSD.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://sbcassessor.com/SampleballotandpollplaceLookup/ballots/bt000009.pdf\">the language readers will see at the </a>voting booth, the tax revenue will be used to fund “local improvements to parking, public safety, lighting, and sidewalks.”</p>\n<p>The language also states that the funds will be used to provide tenant-landlord mediation services, create a municipal advisory council and operate community facilities and events such as the I.V. Community Room at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar or the I.V. Community Center, both of which are behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>The ballot language originally claimed that the tax would accrue $642,000 in funds a year, though the CSD’s preliminary estimate is higher.<strong>  </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82998\" style=\"width: 1008px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1237702627\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83018\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82998\" data-attachment-id=\"82998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/measure-r/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=998%2C324&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"998,324\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure r\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=888%2C288&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82998\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=888%2C288\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Above, a summary of the Isla Vista Community Services District’s revenue sources from the CSD’s Tuesday special meeting report.

The report projects that the CSD’s total revenue will reach $932,944 with the passage of the tax and by fully acquiring the $200,000 UCSB has pledged.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83018\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83018\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/","id":4291,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4290,4289,4288],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AFSCME Strike Comes to an End, A.S.

Clemente Villages and the Santa Catalina Residence Hall. Between 20 to 25 rapes were reported from 2015 to 2017, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The most frequent location of sexual offense — which the report defined differently from sexual assault — is the UC Santa Barbara Library. Eight reports of sexual offenses occured at the UCSB Library, followed by six reports in the Santa Catalina residence hall.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) defines rape as any type of vaginal, anal or oral penetration without consent of the survivor. Sexual offense includes fondling, incest, statutory rape, indecent exposure, peeping and more.</p>\n<p>The report includes UCPD data recorded between 2015 to 2017 and a compilation of articles referring to sexual assault, “hookup culture” and attitudes concerning sexual encounters within Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara and the greater UC system from 2013 to 2017.</p>\n<p>UCSB students had included a sexual assault report card among a list of demands they presented last May to school administrators. In March, the CSD officially began preparing the report.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) made several records requests to UCPD and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) for detailed information regarding sexual assault and misconduct cases. The information includes the specific location of the incidents that took place.</p>\n<p>IVFP denied the CSD’s request on the grounds that the information requested is confidential.</p>\n<p>However, the CSD’s legal counsel confirmed that sexual assault reports in the area are public information and the IVFP does not have proper grounds to withhold the information, according to CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud.</p>\n<p>The information, however, lacks critical details, such as the time the incidents occurred, more specific locations and more detailed classifications of the type of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The board also voted to send a letter to the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office outlining the goals of the report and requesting more information.</p>\n<p>Matan Bostick, CSD public policy intern and author of the report, coded over 30 news articles into categories that best represent the phrases mentioned within each article.</p>\n<p>The category with the highest frequency among articles was “Issue[s] with UC process,” which refers to any problems survivors might have with the UC’s process of reporting sexual assault.</p>\n<p>The next most frequently cited categories were “Bad Results” and “Delays in Response Procedure.” These categories refer to any perceived injustice on the survivor’s behalf and a lack of appropriate and timely responses by police departments or university systems, respectively.</p>\n<p>Bostick used the data from UCPD to organize the information into graphs comparing variables such as location, type of sexual crime, frequency per month and the number of cases forwarded to the District Attorney’s (DA) office.</p>\n<p>UCPD distinguishes data relating to sexual violence between two categories: “sexual assault” and “sexual offense.”</p>\n<p>The data in the report shows that the number of reported sexual assaults increased by over 50 percent from 2015 to 2017. In each year, however, the majority of cases reported to UCPD were not forwarded to the DA’s office.</p>\n<p>Bostick said the shortage of cases forwarded to the DA’s office could be caused by a number of reasons, including a survivor’s choice to not press charges.</p>\n<p>The events “are just the tip of the iceberg, especially in regards to sexual offenses which were reported less frequently than sexual assaults,” Bostick said.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

This allows for flexibility among both students and staff schedules, according to Honegger.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain free counseling for students, long-term counseling is not offered at UCSB, according to Honegger. Students who desire long-term counseling are typically referred to clinicians within the community that can provide more in-depth support.</p>\n<p>“Some students who have a greater need [for more frequent counseling] are seen for longer; it depends on their financial resources and their level of need and what other alternative services are available out there,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>“Some universities like Stanford … offer long term therapy. [However] the moment you want longer term services, you [are] converted to utilizing your insurance,” he added.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. currently has one psychologist for every 967 students and is aiming to expand to have one psychologist for every 750 students, according to Honegger.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.’ desire] is to hire more clinicians and hopefully with that we’ll be able to serve more people and more efficiently serve them,” he said.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.] believes very strongly that mental health resources should be available to all students … [because of this] it’s hard to have long term therapy options,” he said.</p>\n<p>A future in which long-term counseling is offered at UCSB is a possibility, Honegger said. However, that would require C.A.P.S. to have a “bigger budget, a bigger building, and … more clinicians.”</p>\n<p>Honneger said he believes most students are satisfied with the current short-term model C.A.P.S. follows.</p>\n<p>“For the most part, students just want help getting through a rough time and don’t necessarily want the norm to be long term, extensive, and in-depth therapy,” he said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. concentrates on assisting students seeking help from professionals in building self-confidence, reducing stress and solving problems among other things, according to <a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu\">C.A.P.S.’ website</a>.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.] serves a pretty large percent of the student body,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>In the future, C.A.P.S. hopes to hire a social worker or a family therapist to do initial assessments of the students prior to providing counseling or psychological services.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. is open Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Thursdays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Students can also contact the office directly at (805) 893-4411.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared

It is a right, along with … clean air, clean water, and protection from climate impacts,” Creasman said in a press release.</p>\n<p>The legislation will be used to combat the negative effects of California’s natural disasters including the Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara County last December and aid in relief for the Montecito floods, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>A large portion of the bond would fund the implementation of parks in disadvantaged neighborhoods as well as improve the facilities in existing parks, including those in I.V., according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is the lowest income area in the entire county. That sets us up to have priority access to have a lot of the grants that are going to be made available if this bond passes,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>I.V. would be eligible to receive one or more grants that could total up to $200,000 for park improvements. If the proposition is passed, this money could become available close to the end of the year, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>This bond would help California’s economy by increasing job opportunities within national park service in fields including environmental planning, construction and tourism, according to Katalina Vang, California Public Interest Research Group’s (CALPIRG) outreach coordinator at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>CALPIRG is a student-run environmental and political organization on campus at UC Santa Barbara that is advocating for Prop 68 to garner voter support.</p>\n<p>“Prop 68 is actually addressing global warming issues straightforwardly instead of abstractly and we finally are receiving solutions from government officials on how to solve these environmental issues,” Vang said in an email.</p>\n<p>The proposition’s passage would allow for future generations to better conserve the natural resources and guarantee a world that has usable resources, according to Vang.</p>\n<p>“We need to ensure we build a foundation of saving our environment before it gets worse,” she said.</p>\n<p>Despite the number of political leaders and organizations that are in support of the proposition, several public figures openly oppose proposition 68 including Senator John Moorlach, Andrea Seastrand, President of the Central Coast Taxpayers Association and Jon Coupal, President of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.</p>\n<p>Moorlach argued that the bond will do more harm than good because the government would need to raise taxes in order to pay off the money that would need to be borrowed for the measure.</p>\n<p>In an article written by Coupal, he refers to the Legislative Analyst Office report on Prop 68 that estimates that it will take $7.8 billion to pay off the bond: $4 billion in principal spending and $3.8 billion in interest rates.</p>\n<p>“It will take approximately $8 billion to pay off the $4 billion of borrowed funds. That means you can expect a tax increase. And your children can expect a tax increase. And your grandchildren can expect a tax increase,” Moorlach said in a press release.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/","id":3948,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[3947,3946,3945],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AFSCME Begins Strike, Draws Over 200 Supporters at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-07-at-1.27.02-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-07-at-1.27.02-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Workers from all 10 UC campuses plan to strike from May 7 to May 9.

CSD manager. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The tenant-landlord mediation services will foster better relationships between tenants and landlords in I.V. and work out resolutions for disputes, according to Jonathan Abboud, I.V. CSD general manager.</p>\n<p>The program will cost approximately $33,000 which covers the launch date through the end of December 2018, according to Abboud.</p>\n<p>Funding for this program will come from the $200,000 grant awarded to the I.V. CSD from UC Santa Barbara each year. The cost of the project includes payment of the mediator, bilingual assistant, project management, office supplies and insurance.</p>\n<p>The program will operate in the I.V. Community Room on Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Fridays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. During these hours, landlords or tenants can set mediation appointments through an online form found on the I.V. CSD’s website.</p>\n<p>Once a form is submitted, Abboud will contact both parties to schedule an appointment. Mediation is voluntary for both parties, so the scheduling of an appointment would be contingent on the motivation of each party to resolve their conflict.</p>\n<p>During the appointment, a mediator will discuss tenancy issues and help both parties work toward a resolution. The mediator will introduce the rules and conditions of the mediation and act as a neutral party between the landlord and tenant.</p>\n<p>Any discussion during the session is confidential, according to Sayre Macneil, mediator for the CSD.</p>\n<p>After the session, users will complete an evaluation form that the CSD will use to monitor the helpfulness of the program.</p>\n<p>Community members can drop in for counsel on tenancy issues if they cannot schedule an appointment, according to Abboud.</p>\n<p>The program is available for all community members in I.V. This service will not be available for students living in UC Santa Barbara housing, including the Santa Catalina Residence Hall, San Joaquin Villages, Santa Ynez, San Clemente Villages and Storke Family Housing.</p>\n<p>The CSD held a forum Monday to introduce the program and its mediator to the public. Macneil spoke about his experience in mediation and his preference for mediation over court action in resolving conflict.</p>\n<p>Macneil says mediation is a more humane avenue of settling disputes as opposed to using the court system, which can often be time consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>Macneil has been a practicing attorney since 1984 and received a certificate in Mediation and Dispute Resolution at the UC Santa Barbara Extension program.</p>\n<p>He said he has worked on several mediation cases involving landlord and tenant relationships and has identified systemic problems throughout these relationships that repeat themselves in individual cases, such as loss of security deposit, maintenance needs and communication issues.</p>\n<p>He said that solving disputes is often a matter of providing a space for people to express and acknowledge grievances as well as to hear the other party in a non-threatening way.</p>\n<p>“When they can understand that the other side has some legitimacy to their point of view, a resolution is 20 minutes away,” Macneil said.</p>\n<p>The program also includes a bilingual translator to assist mediation with Spanish speaking residents.</p>\n<p>Undocumented families living within I.V. might have more challenges in resolving tenancy issues and enforcing their rights due to their vulnerability as undocumented immigrants/citizens, Macneil said.</p>\n<p>“There are things that make these circumstances such that people need some education in the process about what their rights are,” Macneil said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

U-mail accounts will still be accessible through the “U-Mail Web Access” link found on the UCSB U-mail website, according to Amstutz.</p>\n<p>In addition to current email addresses, UCSBNetID@umail.ucsb.edu, students will also have the option of using a new domain name, UCSBNetID@ucsb.edu.</p>\n<p>The CIO recommends that students frequently check their emails and pay attention to any emails detailing the transition of their account.</p>\n<p>“The best thing you can do to prepare is to watch your email and actually read them because you will get an email that lets you know exactly what day [the email server] is swapping for you … That’s all students need to do,” Amstutz said.</p>\n<p>The CIO is working on completing the transition of emails for the Student Affairs division, Kantrim said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>. This will complete the migration for the entire UC Santa Barbara faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Approximately 12,377 out of 15,222 email accounts of UCSB staff and faculty have been fully transitioned to Google as of March 2018, according to Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for information technology and chief information officer.</p>\n<p>In a 2016 study done by Student Information Systems &amp; Technology (SIS&amp;T), the university found 65 percent of students with Office 365 U-mail accounts were forwarding their emails to other servers. Of those forwarding, 64 percent of emails were being sent to Gmail.</p>\n<p>Students had proposed switching to Gmail when the university first switched from a local email server to Office 365 in 2012. However, the Google platform at the time was difficult to manage and was not as developed as it is today, according to Joe Sabado, SIS&amp;T executive director.</p>\n<p>The transition to the Google server will allow students, faculty and staff to be on the same platform and easily share documents, calendars and improve overall collaboration, Sabado said.</p>\n<p>Although Gmail provides multi-factor authentication, email phishing and other malware will not see a significant change, according to Sam Horowitz, CIO chief information security officer.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, a mailbox is a mailbox,” Horowitz said in an email. “People still need to be careful with email.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: James Kantrim is the Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) service delivery

will open in the near future. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">212F Hotpot, which for months has sported a storefront sign at 6533 Trigo Road, will open by the end of May at the latest, owner David Chen told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The restaurant will be the first personal hot pot restaurant in the area. While the cuisine is Chinese, the theme is not to be confused with regular Chinese hot pot, which provides patrons with a family-style pot at the middle of the table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, 212F Hotpot will give each restaurant-goer a personal pot of boiling soup, so customers can dine individually. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the menu items will be soup-based – broths of beef, seafood and the like will be available to order in a semi-sit-down format. Chen is toying with the idea of takeout, but the idea is to give I.V. residents a spot to sit down and enjoy their dinner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen hasn’t decided the restaurant’s hours of operation. After opening, it will stay open until 10 or 11 p.m., but he might decide to close earlier or later depending on the restaurant’s initial popularity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If customers want to come, we’ll serve them any time,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be Chen’s third eatery in the area. He also owns PokeMee, a poke restaurant, and Choppa Rollin’ Ice Cream, a Thai rolled ice cream store, both of which are found on Hollister Avenue in Goleta. The two shops offer niche products in an area mostly bereft of non-generic Asian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen will change the name of PokeMee to Choppa Poke in the near future, due to a name dispute with a poke restaurant in Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal hot pot will provide a “whole new concept” of hot pot cuisine to the community, Chen highlighted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many restaurants in I.V. are staples, some close down quickly after opening. A number of joints have shut down shop in the past few years, including Otaco, El Sitio, La Cantina, Santa Ynez Burrito and Kol’s Cafe — the last of which is the predecessor to 212F Hotpot’s location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the problem is the food itself, some is the type of food,” Chen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re hoping to be a staple,” added manager Will Groman, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara just last quarter. Groman worked at PokeMee before Chen hired him to be a part of 212F Hotpot from the ground up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In I.V. there aren’t many places where you can sit down for 30 minutes,” Groman said. “You order and take it to go home. It’d be nice to have an atmosphere where people can come, sit down and be lively.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen moved to Santa Barbara County in 2016 after noticing that the area had no poke restaurants. He used money from his existing e-commerce company to fund the startup costs. Since then, he has launched several restaurants, 212F Hotpot being the third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming months, he said, he plans to open a State Street shop that sells both poke and Thai ice cream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a background in sales, Chen stressed there is no one good way to pitch people on the hot pot joint. Instead, he offered a catch-all line to interested consumers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s new, so come try it out,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-04/hot-pot-restaurant-to-open-in-isla-vista-by-end-of-may/","id":4295,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4294,4293,4292],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Students overwhelmingly voted for the A.S. executive candidates and reaffirmation fees over the open senator positions.</p>\n<p>Over the past 13 years, the highest voter turnout was in 2012, when 41.78 percent of the student body voted in the spring quarter election.

After their first thrifting event with EAB, they participated in the Isla Vista Open Market, a flea market that hosts events at Little Acorn Park.<em> Courtesy of Isla Vista Trading Post</em></p></div>\n<p>Patrons of the trading post can take three pieces of clothing from the pop-up shops, free of charge.</p>\n<p>The founders see no reason to make a profit off of their passion for thrifting, instead hoping that their “three for free” rule will encourage people to pay their efforts forward and choose to donate their old clothes at a future event if they wish.</p>\n<p>Rothfield, a fourth-year communication major, initially pitched the idea for the trading post as a project for one of her communication classes in the fall.</p>\n<p>“Our project was to come up with something that would help the community, so I pitched this idea for something sustainable and fashion-oriented,” she said.</p>\n<p>Rothfield was inspired by the “free box” in Isla Vista, which are bins full of free clothing outside the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District building.</p>\n<p>The founders of the trading post planned their first pop-up thrift shop during Fall Quarter, but when the Thomas Fire hit Santa Barbara County, plans for the event were abandoned.</p>\n<p>The delay, as well as Rothfield’s graduation from UC Santa Barbara, left the future of the trading post up in the air.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sofia Willis, who now runs IVTP with Forsell, wanted to bring thrifting to Isla Vista, but lacked the means.</p>\n<p>Willis, a second-year philosophy and sociology double major, initially got involved in thrifting through the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB), taking to the Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page to round up clothing donations.</p>\n<p>Through Facebook she met Rothfield and Forsell, whose vision for the Isla Vista Trading Post matched her own and the three branched off to reinvigorate the project.</p>\n<p>“I wanted this to be not just about the environment, but also community, and fashion and self-expression, which is the direction [the project] was going in as well,” Willis said.</p>\n<p>To reach a larger scope of the surrounding community, the trading post decided to host its pop-up shop in Isla Vista rather than on campus. After their first thrifting event with EAB, they participated in the Isla Vista Open Market, a flea market that hosts events at Little Acorn Park.</p>\n<p>With shops hosted by student artists and vintage clothing curators, Rothfield thought the trading post would be a natural addition to the market.</p>\n<p>Forsell and Willis agree that they want to educate people about the human rights violations in the fast fashion industry and cited sustainability as the primary goal of the trading post.</p>\n<p>“We like to say that the fast fashion industry is the second dirtiest industry in the world,” Forsell said.</p>\n<p>They said, however, that their mission does not have a political agenda.</p>\n<p>The organization is comprised of approximately 15 dedicated students, five of whom hold official administrative positions. The volunteers meet on Wednesday nights to plan thrifting events, collect donations and postulate about the future of the rapidly-growing trading post.</p>\n<p>Ultimately one of the main goals of the Isla Vista Trading Post is to normalize thrift shopping and to welcome all people who are interested. Willis believes that thrift shopping currently belongs to a very specific group of people, which she hopes to destigmatize.</p>\n<p>“Right now it seems like thrifting belongs to a very niche group, sort of, and it’s not like everybody thrifts because it’s fashionable or cool, it’s kind of just a niche group that does it,” Forsell explained.</p>\n<p>Willis and Forsell said the next major step is to apply for nonprofit status in order to receive funding from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>\n<p>They are hopeful that with this funding they will be able to buy a storage unit, as they have currently been storing the enormous amounts of leftover clothes in their cars.</p>\n<p>While the trading post is a nonprofit organization, Willis, Forsell, Rothfield and the other members of their team have all paid out of pocket to get the organization off the ground. Willis said she sees the organization as an “investment” and hopes of one day buying a van and a storage unit.</p>\n<p>They also hope to plan a raffle for some of the high value items they have received as donations and would like to host an art show in conjunction with student artists and local businesses.</p>\n<p>In the short term, Willis and Forsell are looking forward to collaborating with WORD Magazine, Surfrider Foundation and the sustainability chairs of Greek life organizations as part of the Greeks Go Green initiative in order to bring the trading post to as many places as they can.</p>\n<p>“We’d like to expand past Isla Vista and inspire other college campuses and communities,” Forsell said. “And if this generation can get used to trading clothes, then future generations will start doing that.”</p>\n<p>“‘Remember when people used to buy clothes instead of trading them?’ That’s my dream, to be able to say that to my kids,” Willis said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the May 3 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
