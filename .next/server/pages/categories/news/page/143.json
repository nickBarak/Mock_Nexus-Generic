Food Bank.</p>\n<p>In explaining the California State Budget’s impact on the education system, third-year student Ajinkya Joshi discussed Governor Jerry Brown’s priorities in educational funding and also said tuition costs are expected to remain unchanged in the upcoming years.</p>\n<p>“He’s going to focus on making a five percent increase in the general fund to schools and higher education,” Joshi said. “Essentially, our tuition won’t be increasing; it will be stable, and the UCs and CSUs are going to be aiming to try to increase innovation and trying to make it so that way more of us graduate at a lower cost.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Joshi said the current problems in higher education are that the UCs have a higher cost structure and higher per student subsidy.</p>\n<p>“Right now the problem is trying to maintain the quality of education while keeping the costs low for the student,” Joshi said.</p>\n<p>Although Joshi’s presentation covered a fairly large quantity of information that would directly impact UCSB students, Senators came close to denying Joshi sufficient time to make the presentation. The vote on granting Joshi his requested 10 minutes of extra time turned out to be a tie until Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet broke it with a vote in favor of the time extension.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore spoke briefly on plans for Deltopia, the annual student-organized event coming up this Spring Quarter, regarding efforts to provide extra police units, Port-a-Potties and access to drinking water during the festivities. Moore said he will advocate for a similar system established during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“What I want to do is an expanded version of what we did for Halloween,” Moore said. “We’ll have a hydration station and some sort of safety effort as well.”</p>\n<p>Chair of A.S. Food Bank and third-year economics and accounting major Erick Lankey reported on a series of upcoming events geared toward enhancing student involvement and knowledge about the Food Bank. According to Lankey, these events include “how to eat on a low budget” tours through the I.V. Food Co-op, an extreme couponing team contest and a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program challenge in which participants pledge to live on $31.50 of food for a week in an effort to gain empathy for the challenges faced by individuals living on food stamps.</p>\n<p>The presentation received positive feedback from Off-Campus Senators Andre Taylor and Nick Onyshko. Taylor said he was “very excited” to participate, and Onyshko said he applauds the Food Bank for its growth as an organization.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to say all this stuff sounds amazing, and I’m really impressed with everything you’ve done with this committee,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>Bills passed during the meeting included a bill to update Take Back the Night’s legal code as well as another bill that limits the amount of money campus BCCs spend on food per quarter to $500 or less, depending on the size of the particular BCC, as part of an effort to reduce wasteful spending. A bill to establish a new A.S. logo was tabled for another week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/","id":3138,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3137,3136,3135],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Is Isla Vista Rent Too Damn High?

Daily Nexus File Photo.</p></div>\n<p>With ‘For Rent’ signs slapped on almost every house or apartment in Isla Vista, thousands of students are now joining the annual housing rush that begins around the end of every Fall Quarter and beginning of every Winter. During this time, a swarm of UCSB students phone landlords, knock on doors and scramble to fill out paperwork to claim anything from a dream house on the ocean side of Del Playa Drive to a cozy little apartment on Picasso.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Admissions Office reveals statistics that show 52 percent of UCSB students reside in off-campus, non-university owned housing located in I.V., Goleta or Santa Barbara. With the sheer amount of fellow house-hunting competitors, students have been known to rush through house-securing procedures and eventually pay a hefty price for lease agreements that are signed too quickly.</p>\n<p>According to Jennifer Ja Birchim, spokesperson from the UCSB Community Housing Office, students facing housing troubles are met with these obstacles only once they actually begin living in their reserved apartments or houses. Such problems include complaints about management, dissatisfaction over rent prices, lack of understanding for the terms written on the lease contract and issues with rushed roommate pairings.</p>\n<p>“Slow down,” Ja Birchim said. “There’s this buzz that happens come October, this panic that they need to find housing. We’re really trying to slow them down and educate them.”</p>\n<p>In this case, Ja Birchim suggests students take a look at the Community Housing Office’s education programs, such as a Rental Fair which is taking place today at the Arbor, where representatives of a variety of housing managements in I.V. will be located to interact with students still seeking out available rental spaces.</p>\n<p>“We are having these educational programs to really walk students through the process so that they go in with their eyes wide open about housing options, living in the community and what that looks like,” Ja Birchim said.</p>\n<p><strong>I.V. Living: “Not Always Rainbows and Butterflies…”</strong></p>\n<p>Even with these resources, a number of students struggle with their housing decisions. Notorious I.V. apartment living concerns range from safety issues to parking problems. For third-year psychology major Emily Lofthouse, one of the biggest quips about renting involves the infamously inflated rental prices.</p>\n<p>“I.V. is the place that most students want to and do live in, and landlords know that, so housing can be really expensive,” Lofthouse said.</p>\n<p>Sharing a one-bedroom apartment can range from $600-$800 per student per month, while a house on DP holding about seven to eight people can be close to $4,000-$8,000 total per month. Like Lofthouse, second-year chemical engineering major Scott Lynn said the financial weight of I.V. housing can leave an ugly dent in a renter’s checkbook, but this monetary burden is also passed along to the non-student residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>“The thing about I.V. is that it is near the beach and is close to campus, so that means there is high demand not only from college students, but also from other families in the area who have children in the schools around here,” Lynn said. “It sucks that both of those parties have to pay such high prices, especially since the families in the area tend to be of lower income.”</p>\n<p>While Lynn understands the reasoning behind the high prices, he sometimes feels uncomfortable that the money he currently pays could potentially afford a much better house in another area.</p>\n<p>“My apartment is worth the price, for the area at least. I know in other college towns, like Davis, the price I’m paying for my apartment would rent a house twice as big,” Lynn said.</p>\n<p>Along with prices, Lofthouse said she also marks noise as a pressing concern on her list of I.V. housing cons.</p>\n<p>“I called the cops on my neighbors once because they were screaming, running up and down the side of the house during midterms. I had no idea what they were doing and why they were doing it,” Lofthouse said. “The cops came and told them to shut up, but they didn’t.”</p>\n<p>With UCSB ranked the #2 ‘Party School’ in the nation by the Princeton Review back in August, the noise comes as no shocker for many. Second-year economics and environmental science double major Antonia Tran said she views noise as a minor problem in comparison to the security and crime concerns in I.V. — such as theft, assaults and stabbings — which can oftentimes be committed by (predictably) drunk residents. However, Tran said, with I.V. only about two square miles wide, such rowdiness is unavoidable.</p>\n<p>“Living here is definitely a blessing along with a curse, because with so many young people who also happen to party often together, a lot of belligerence and carelessness is bound to happen: unwelcome guests, unsolicited attention, too much noise and disorderly conduct,” Tran said. “These are just to name a few when you live in a very heavily college-based community in such a small area.”</p>\n<p><strong>Apartments vs. Dorms</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the barrage of downfalls to living the I.V. life, third-year economics and accounting major Michelle Cho, who currently lives on the 6500 block of DP’s vibrant ocean side, said I.V. offers freshmen or transfer students residing in the residence halls an opportunity to smoothly transition into independent living.</p>\n<p>Cho admits, however, that renting a house in I.V. is in no way “easier” than university housing options. While UCSB Housing &amp; Residential Services offer their residents internet access, a live-in staff and 24-hour on-call maintenance, amongst other services, renters in I.V. must be responsible for their own house cleaning, cooking and bill paying.</p>\n<p>Then come the fees. According to UCSB Housing &amp; Residential Services, a standard double room with a 14-meal plan costs $14,211 for the entire 2013-14 school year, with a single costing a little more at $15,711 and a triple at $11,411. Prices fluctuate on whether residence hall students choose to book a 10-meal, 17-meal or unlimited meal plan. In comparison, a single individual’s full-year lease of an apartment in I.V. — keeping in mind that this means renting for 12 months while the residence hall rooms are “rented” for a little less than nine — oftentimes turns out cheaper, with prices paid per person ranging anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000. However, costs of utilities and weekly food supplies must be taken into account, and many of the higher-paying renters find themselves balancing out the prices with those offered by UCSB’s residence halls.</p>\n<p>According to Cho, however, as long as students stay smart about house-hunting and are aware and comfortable with their fee payments, renting in I.V. becomes an invaluable tool to help students learn crucial skills such as cooking and paying bills. Cho said I.V. living is part of a period of trial and error that can help students gauge what sort of living environment is right for them in the future.</p>\n<p>“There’s so much freedom. We live on our own and we can follow our own rules, given they also follow the restrictions on our lease. With that comes a lot of independence,” Cho said. “Having your own place kind of forces you to grow up and take responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Choosing housing in I.V. does not necessarily mean students must go through independent management companies, however. UCSB provides university-owned apartments at El Dorado, Santa Ynez, Westgate and Westwinds as well as graduate apartments at the San Clemente Villages and family student apartments on Storke Road and at the west end of campus.</p>\n<p>Because dorms were overbooked, second-year electrical engineering major Han Chou was offered space in the San Clemente apartments with a few other friends. Chou said all residents at San Clemente receive a single and interact with each other less than would dorm residents. However, he said the people at San Clemente appear more independent and the environment at the apartments are much more conducive for studying purposes.</p>\n<p>“Having my own room really helped me during testing weeks and keeping my privacy,” Chou said. “There really isn’t much to complain about other than occasional ant problems.”</p>\n<p><strong>Words from the Landlords</strong></p>\n<p>While some managements are more involved with their tenants and strive to build pleasant and professional rapport, others never speak or respond to their tenants and only see them twice — once for lease signing and once again for key turn-ins.</p>\n<p>According to James Knapp of Koto Group Inc., a fairly new property management with multiple locations dispersed throughout I.V., the toughest challenge Koto Group faces lies in the education of first-time renters on how the whole housing process works. According to Knapp, renters are encouraged to contact the management team at any time via email, phone and text messaging.</p>\n<p>Knapp also said UCSB clientele comes across as more appealing to him and Koto Group since UCSB students are more “friendly, appreciative and easy to work with.”</p>\n<p>“Renting to students is great,” Knapp said. “I particularly enjoy working with the I.V. community since they are quick to adopt new technology that we offer, as well as give us interesting ideas about how we can improve our properties and services.”</p>\n<p>For UCSB alumnus and president of Meridian Group Real Estate Management Robert Kooyman, the realm of I.V. leasing is highly familiar. Having studied real estate and management for 28 years, Kooyman said he advises students to educate themselves about the different management companies and their respective leasing philosophies.</p>\n<p>“Some managements are very laissez-faire, ‘hands off.’ We’re never going to talk to you until June when you move out. Here are the keys. You won’t hear from us,’” Kooyman said. “Then, there are some of us who want to try to find the middle road. We want to do an annual inspection, check on you and the property and we want be a resource.’”</p>\n<p>According to Kooyman, knowing about the various housing options available in I.V. — from building type and size to price and location — will help students make better decisions about their future living situation.</p>\n<p>“Become an educated customer,” Kooyman said. “There are lots of choices out there.”</p>\n<p><strong>There’s No Place Like I.V.</strong></p>\n<p>Amidst all the steps and factors involved in the whirlwind of I.V. housing, many students still find their college years spent in the tiny beachside community to be a “once-in-a-lifetime” experience, according to Tran.</p>\n<p>“It truly is an experience that you’re only exposed to once, and this kind of thing doesn’t even happen at all colleges necessarily,” Tran said. “It’s two square miles of all these people that are in your age group going through the same things as you, and for the most part, it’s a very friendly, student-based community.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Kim Garcia said while she found her freshman year experience in a dorm beneficial as a new UCSB student, living in an apartment in I.V. has improved her levels of self-sufficiency and has not barred her from meeting new people. Like Tran, Garcia said she does not regret her decision one bit.</p>\n<p>“My experience in I.V. has been absolutely amazing,” Garcia said. “I have never felt so free in my life. I have had the opportunity to make friends, learn a lot about myself and become very independent.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Rilla Peng contributed to this article.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53672\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/is-isla-vista-rent-too-damn-high-a-closer-look-into-housing-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53672\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/is-isla-vista-rent-too-damn-high-a-closer-look-into-housing-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/is-isla-vista-rent-too-damn-high-a-closer-look-into-housing-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/is-isla-vista-rent-too-damn-high-a-closer-look-into-housing-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/is-isla-vista-rent-too-damn-high-a-closer-look-into-housing-in-i-v/","id":3490,"author":{"id":197,"name":"Shannon Ham"},"related":[3489,3488,3487],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AS Legislation Seeks to Reassign Responsibilities","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Legislation is in the works to restructure Associated Students and its governing bodies, with plans to create special committees in A.S.

Senate that will be responsible for certain A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions and related areas of interest.</p>\n<p>Changes will include the formation of Senate Committees, small groups of senators which will focus with greater depth on particular issues before recommending legislation for all senators to vote on. Another change includes the formation of Senate Administrative Committees, which will dedicate more time to reading over records of Boards, Committees or Commissions meetings than is possible under the current Senate structure. The third revision of the proposed restructuring will be presented to a gathering of all A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions on Friday, Jan. 31 for discussion.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud said he thinks the proposed are changes necessary, saying they will create a greater sense of accountability amongst campus groups and address the current lack of structure and specialization within A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>“The Senate meetings run long,” Abboud said, “Without taking a long time, [the senators] don’t really have the opportunity to take a look at resolutions and bills and fix them and make them better before passing them.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, there are two fundamental problems with the current organization of A.S., the first of which is an alleged overload of responsibilities for senators. In regard to this first problem, Abboud said organizing senators into committees directly dealing with particular issues will cut down on time spent during meetings.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have Senate committees, much like city council or California legislature, that deal with matters on a smaller basis and then recommend legislation back up to the Senate,” he said.</p>\n<p>The second problem he mentioned was discrepancies in the relationships between BCCs — or Boards, Committees and Commissions — and the rest of A.S.</p>\n<p>“There is no definition between the different kinds of entities in A.S,” Abboud said. “There are unclear relationships between the Senate and the BCCs and the Execs and the BCCs.”</p>\n<p>However, many students involved with these A.S. groups hold concerns about how the new restructuring plan will affect the autonomy of each campus group, as they will now be grouped with other organizations and have an A.S. senator representing their interests at Senate meetings. Chair of the Womyn’s Commission Olivia Jaffe-Pachuilo, a third-year French major, is concerned about the effects the restructuring will have on student input for each organization.</p>\n<p>“It’s the details that concern me,” she said. “I don’t think it’s inherently bad, but when it comes down to the bits and pieces, people need to have their own say about what happens to their own groups.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year sociology and psychology major Ali Guthy, who heads the committee authoring the legislation of the restructure, said the new plan addresses divisions that are currently present in the student government.</p>\n<p>“There’s a disconnect between all the different entities within A.S,” Guthy said. “It doesn’t feel like we’re all under the Association.”</p>\n<p>Such disconnect leads students to misunderstand the role of A.S., according to third-year Andre Theus, off-campus senator and vice-chair of the restructuring committee.</p>\n<p>“Everyone thinks that A.S. is Program Board,” Theus said. “They’re a huge face of A.S., but no one knows that there’s this governmental side so there’s this lack of unity.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, BCCs such A.S. Publications and the A.S. Ticket Office will be grouped together in order to promote greater unity within A.S. under the new structure. She also said the restructuring will not affect the internal workings of any BCC.</p>\n<p>“In no [version of the] restructure, has the internal functioning of a group changed,” she said. “We’re changing how groups communicate between each other.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53613\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53613\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-21/as-legislation-seeks-to-reassign-responsibilities/","id":3121,"author":{"id":190,"name":"Leon Freyermuth"},"related":[3120,3119,3118],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

If the answer is yes, you’re probably not the only one digging up the Internet’s version of your personal history.</p>\n<p>From February 11 to March 6 of last year, a nationwide survey conducted by the employment website CareerBuilder.com found 39 percent of companies use social networking sites to research their job candidates. Meanwhile, only 11 percent of survey respondents said they do not check online profiles.</p>\n<p>The survey’s findings suggest employers use social media to look into the applicants’ personality and behavior outside their job interview, helping them gauge how well the candidate can fit in with the company culture. Examples of content examined include the positive, such as conveyence of a professional image or display of creativity, and the negative — such as posting of provocative photos, bad mouthing previous employers or even alcohol and drug use.</p>\n<p>But the ongoing trend is not a new one. In 2006, a survey by the private business network ExecuNet discovered 77 percent of corporate executives reported using social media sites to learn more about job applicants. A third of this 77 percent indicated that they found enough “digital dirt” to reject a potential candidate’s application.</p>\n<p>In light of this, Bradley Shear, a Maryland attorney who specializes in social media law, said he cautions job-seekers from posting potential harmful content on their social media pages. Shear advised Congressional Representative Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) in authoring the Social Network Online Protection Act, a bill forbidding institutions of higher education and employers from requesting access to student or applicant social network accounts. However, Shear said online content is never safe from employers’ eyes.</p>\n<p>“Candidates for employment are being searched online all of the time,” Shear said. “Searching candidates online has become part and parcel of the hiring process, and there is nothing illegal about performing an Internet search about someone applying for a job, just like it is not illegal to ask for references and/or past employers to verify information about a candidate.”</p>\n<p>But one of the difficulties that arise when employers Google names and online profiles of prospetive employees, according to Shear, is the growing prevalence of fake social media accounts. CNN reported in August 2012 that Facebook estimated there was about 83 million false Facebook accounts that year. Soon after, the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission filed a 2012 report identifying two problematic types of Facebook accounts: the “misclassified” and the “undesirable accounts” — the latter group being profiles that have violated any of Facebook’s terms of service policies.</p>\n<p>Because of this, Shear said it is difficult for an employer to know whether the online identity found is the right identity. In this case, he said it is illegal in some states for employers to request applicants to verify their online identities. States prohibiting this practice are California, Illinois, Maryland and Michigan.</p>\n<p>However, Shear said the law is not designed to protect people who abuse the freedoms inherent to the Internet.</p>\n<p>“The law is meant to protect those going out of the way to protect their own privacy and not those who are careless online,” Shear said. “If someone is being careless, that is their own problem.”</p>\n<p>Currently, many social media sites are taking a stand against the practice of employers using online profiles as a measure of one’s personal character. For example, Facebook — the largest social networking service worldwide — issued a statement in March 2012 condemning such activities.</p>\n<p>“As a user, you shouldn’t be forced to share your private information and communications just to get a job,” the statement said. “And as the friend of a user, you shouldn’t have to worry that your private information or communications will be revealed to someone you don’t know and didn’t intend to share with, just because that user is looking for a job,” according to the statement, which was authored by the company’s chief privacy officer, Eric Egan.</p>\n<p>Scrutiny of applicants’ social media profiles does not only exist for employment purposes. Kaplan Test Prep recently released a summary of its survey of college admissions officers and found that 31 percent of respondents — a bump up from 26 percent last year — said they visited an applicant’s social networking page to learn more about them. In addition, 30 percent of admissions officers polled said they found online content that negatively impacted a student’s application.</p>\n<p>In 2013, roughly 21.8 million high school graduates were expected to enroll in over 4,400 degree granting institutions in the United States, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. With more students than ever enrolling in college, the big question becomes: Shouldn’t freshmen and transfer applicants be worried?</p>\n<p>Christine Brown, Executive Director of Kaplan Test Prep’s College Prep Programs, said she believes otherwise.</p>\n<p>“Students should be aware and careful, but not worried,” Brown said. “There is no reason to say that admissions officers are doing this for any nefarious reasons. They often do searches for themselves to see what people are saying about their schools.”</p>\n<p>However, Brown said students must stay proactive about being responsible for maintaining and posting appropriate online content.</p>\n<p>“Your social media presence is something that you have a lot of control over,” Brown said. “Students need to recognize that anything and everything they post online can be fair game — fairly or unfairly.”</p>\n<p>But disquieting stories of students’ social media profiles harming them for job or school applications has prompted countless news sites to suggest students “clean up” their profiles during application season. In November 2013, the New York Times ran an article discussing an online profile situation gone wrong for a student applying to Bowdoin College in Massachusetts. The student attended an on-campus information session and later posted negative comments on Twitter about her fellow attendees. According to the article, her actions garnered criticism from Bowdoin’s Dean of Admissions, and she was denied admission to the university.</p>\n<p>Despite such stories, Brown said the actual chances of a student being looked up for the sake of admissions are not necessarily high. She said application officers probably only do so if a student’s application contains different or unique elements, whether alarming or impressive.</p>\n<p>“Generally, there needs to be a flag, something good or negative,” Brown said. “It could be anything.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, UC spokesperson Dianne Klein said the sheer number of applicants makes it unrealistic for admission officers to be browsing through online profiles on networks such as Facebook or Twitter. According to a 2013 information summary report offered through the UC Office of the President, 174,767 students applied to the UC for Fall 2013 — an increase of 8.6 percent from the number of fall applicants the year before. The report also stated these gains in admissions were being seen by all UC campuses, from Berkeley’s increase of 8.1 percent to Santa Cruz’s increase of 14.8 percent.</p>\n<p>“We do not check applicants on social media,” Klein said in an email. “We simply have too many applicants to do that.”</p>\n<p>Lisa Przekop, UCSB Director of Admissions, said reviewing social media content of applicants has never been a part of the admissions process.</p>\n<p>“It has never been done at UC Santa Barbara. The only information used in our review of an applicant is the information they provide on the UC application,” Przekop said. “We would not have need to review social media profiles.”</p>\n<p>But even when schools do opt to check students’ online profiles, applicants can protect themselves through various privacy options. Brown said applicants always have the choice to crack down on their privacy settings, or refuse to add “friends” and other connections they do not recognize.</p>\n<p>“We encourage students to be aware that their digital footprint and online persona is part of their identity,” Brown said. “Also keep in mind that college admissions officers are just that: admissions officers. They aren’t privacy experts or sleuths. They don’t have magic passwords to open your private Facebook account or Twitter feed. They are overwhelmingly judging your application on the traditional factors like your GPA and SAT or SAT score.”</p>\n<p>In the end, Brown said the choice of being careful lies with the students, saying it is their job to do the best they can in cleaning up their online footprints.</p>\n<p>“We advise students to check their digital trails and keep them clean. Search yourself on Google, Bing and other search engines and clean up anything that doesn’t put you in a positive light,” Brown said. “Be smart and think about everything you post online before you do it. The Internet has a long memory.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Wednesday, January 8, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/","id":3484,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3483,3482,3481],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sk8 or Die: Group Makes Headway on Skate Park","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Isla Vista may be welcoming a new skate park after a dozen local skaters attended an Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) meeting in December to protest converting PerfectPark into a parki...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista may be welcoming a new skate park after a dozen local skaters attended an Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) meeting in December to protest converting PerfectPark into a parking lot.</p>\n<p>IVRPD board members previously planned to use PerfectPark, located at the intersection of Embarcadero del Mar and Embarcadero del Norte, as a space to install 14 parking spots. Parking costs at the lot were expected to bring in about $10,000 a year, with the funds being used to repair broken fences and restore bathrooms at Anisq’Oyo’ Park. While skaters were able to persuade trustees to keep the lot open, board members are still debating the construction of a skate park due to budgetary constraints.</p>\n<p>At the helm of the movement to salvage the land for a permanent skate park is the two-year-old Goleta Skateboard Movement (GSM). According to GSM co-president Elliott Rebuck, GSM’s three main objectives are advocacy for the skateboarding community, education and outreach and supporting and constructing skate spots.</p>\n<p>Despite being around for only two years, the GSM is comprised of volunteers who all collaborate to work toward an enhancement of the Goleta Valley skateboarding heritage through recreational opportunities offered to the community and its youth, according to Rebuck.</p>\n<p>“The volunteers are lifelong skaters who first got involved with skate park advocacy, design and construction well over a decade ago,” Rebuck said.</p>\n<p>Rebuck said city officials do not often take into account the community’s significant demand for a skate park and oftentimes overlook the health, safety and economic advantages a successful skate park can have. For example, the park can act as a community gathering center, attract tourists, promote healthy and active lifestyles and maintain skater safety by providing a smooth space to train instead of forcing skaters to practice over irregular surfaces.</p>\n<p>“Once a skate park is constructed, it will provide a low-cost recreational alternative to organized sports, encourage athleticism, fitness and confidence-building amongst its users, while simultaneously breaking down barriers of race, gender, age, religion, economic status or language spoken,” Rebuck said.</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould, a skate park would be a good addition to Isla Vista for its socio-cultural benefits similar to those described by Rebuck. However, Gould said such benefits would only apply if the skate park is kept safe, well-maintained and drug- and alcohol-free.</p>\n<p>“It’s an activity that crosses all age, economic and racial barriers,” Gould said. “I see it as a way to narrow cultural divides and open doors to interaction and understanding between the different factions of the community.”</p>\n<p>Gould said making progress on implementing a skate park and other types of projects may oftentimes be difficult due to the short-term length of the Parks and Recreation District positions.</p>\n<p>“One of the major challenges for the District has been the turnover of board members and management,” Gould said. “If you include short-term interim GMs, I am the thirteenth General Manager in as many years. Board members also tend to come and go quickly, largely due to graduating students. With the rapid turnover, it’s hard to keep momentum going.”</p>\n<p>However, the most daunting problem facing the completion of a skate park is funding, according to Gould.</p>\n<p>“The District operates on a fixed income that gets only a small adjustment annually,” Gould said. “The adjustment is only enough to cover daily operations and doesn’t leave money for major capital projects … The last thing we want is an awesome skate park that falls into disrepair due to lack of money.”</p>\n<p>Rebuck said while he understands the pressure within money constraints, he feels that more grassroots organizing efforts are necessary in order to convince the city of a skate park’s importance.</p>\n<p>“So far the community hasn’t made building one a priority,” Rebuck said. “Our next step is to recruit more advocates within Isla Vista’s skate community, gain support from non-skateboarding residents and business owners, then collaborate with the IVRPD and city to develop a shared vision that will meet the demand.”</p>\n<p>Currently, the GSM is also working with several other potential skate park spots along the Hollister corridor and is promoting and attending design workshops for these sites.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/","id":4806,"author":{"id":178,"name":"Jackson Kerr"},"related":[4805,4804,4803],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Doctor Who?

To Tobolowsky, it sounds like fun.</p>\n<p>“It’s essentially a 15-hour day of straight-up work, and I love it,” he said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Tobolowsky is a pre-medical student who, along with thousands of other students across the country, has a passion for the health sciences.</p>\n<p>Every year, medical schools receive massive numbers of applications. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, last year almost 8,000 people applied to the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine, 7,000 applied to UC San Francisco, 6,000 to UC San Diego and a little over 5,000 to UC Irvine and UC Davis. Nearly 5,000 applied to Yale while over 6,000 students applied to Harvard and Stanford Universities.</p>\n<p>Now, medical schools are accepting a rising number of students, as the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine reports enrollment at osteopathic medical schools has steadily increased in recent years. The 2011-2012 academic year saw about 5,600 new students enrolled in osteopathic medical schools, reflecting a seven percent rise in first-year enrollment from the previous year.</p>\n<p>Numbers are on the rise, but UCSB Pre-Health Advisor Scott Kassner warns there are several considerations that should go into a student’s decision to enter medical field. For one, he said students should take a hard look at how well they do in hard science courses, sometimes known as “weeder” classes.</p>\n<p>“The first thing is you have to be honest about your academic abilities and your academic interests,” Kassner said. “There are lots of students who are interested in health as a profession because they want to help people, but that doesn’t always mean they’re going to be successful in chemistry or biology — the courses you really have to succeed in to have any chance in medical school.”</p>\n<p>Tobolowsky, too, underlined the necessity of understanding one’s own strengths, even if that means not doing a certain area of medicine or avoiding the field altogether.</p>\n<p>“A physician once told me, ‘You don’t necessarily have to do what you love. Do what you’re good at,’” Tobolowsky said. “If you suck at performing surgery, people are dying left and right. You have to be good at what you’re doing.”</p>\n<p>But students can end up setting standards that are nearly impossible to meet, with the pursuit of high grades putting a great deal of pressure on pre-med students. Kassner, for example, said although stress is often inevitable, he has seen students fret excessively over a single grade: “You have a student who is getting a B in Writing 2 and thinks that they have to drop the class because that B will keep them out of medical school,” Kassner said. “While you do have to be concerned how well you’re doing academically … it’s also not the case that one course keeps you out of medical school.” With such a high standard to reach, students may even be prone to disregarding their own well-being. In this case, Kassner advises students to ask themselves — is medical school really the right path? “Miserable people don’t become doctors,” Kassner said. “Very rarely will they be able to succeed in the application process.”</p>\n<p>But even if a student has been accepted to the school of his or her dreams, actually getting through those four years of intense schooling may prove an even greater obstacle. Consequently, another factor students should consider before going pre-med is how serious of a commitment medical school actually is. “Students have to do research and talk to as many doctors and people in the health professions as they can because it is a very demanding life,” Kassner said.</p>\n<p>Tobolowsky said he is well aware of the reality of being a medical student. “Including undergrad, you potentially sacrifice anywhere from eight to 16 years of your life,” he said. “But those years of your life are dedicated to medicine and helping people in the future, not to your family, to vacations, to some things other people get to enjoy.”</p>\n<p>Another sacrifice associated with medical school is the exorbitant amount of debt medical students are forced into. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, 87 percent of students from public institutions and 84 percent of students from private institutions graduated with debt. These debts were not minimal by any means, as students who graduated from a public medical school ended up with a mean debt of $162,736 while those who graduate from a private institution received a mean debt of $181,058. Kenna Nhey, second-year biochemistry major, said she wants to become a doctor for its “well-respected” nature but hesitates to apply simply because of how expensive medical school tuition is. “The cost of medical school alone is kind of a lot, and it’s four more years plus residency, and I know the healthcare system is changing a lot and doctors might make less.”</p>\n<p>With the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the healthcare system may soon come to rely less upon doctors and more upon individuals in related professions that require less schooling. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will expand coverage to 32 million individuals, mostly previously uninsured adults, and by 2020, the U.S. will face an estimated shortage of 91,000 physicians — particularly in low-income communities. Growing numbers of nurse practitioners and physician assistants will compensate for part of this shortage. Nurse practitioners already account for 27 percent of primary care providers nationally, and physician assistants account for 15 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. As of now, the foundation estimates nurse practitioners are the fastest growing segment of the primary care workforce, and physician assistants are not far behind.</p>\n<p>According to Health Affairs, a leading journal of health policy thought and research, “impending physician shortages in the United States will necessitate greater reliance on physician assistants and nurse practitioners, particularly in primary care.” The journal also included a survey that found approximately half the population prefers to have a physician as its primary care provider, but is perfectly amenable to seeing a nurse practitioner if physicians are unavailable for longer than a day.</p>\n<p>Jobs such as these are viable alternatives for students who may not want to work so many hours, as Kassner said they can typically give you “a little more control over your life and your lifestyle,” with their inclusion of “predictable” hours and schedules that are “more conducive to having a family life.” He said they can even allow for more interaction with patients. However, there are also plenty of other careers in the health sciences. Second-year biology major Laura Sena, for example, is thinking about going into nutrition. Although she decided not to go through with pre-med, she is still interested in entering another field within the health sciences.</p>\n<p>“I was thinking maybe nursing when I came here, but they don’t have some of the classes you need to become a nurse,” Sena said. “I knew I wanted to do something health-related, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go full-on med school.” The extended period of schooling required for becoming a doctor was another factor deterring Sena from the life of a med student. “I don’t want to be in school for another eight years,” Sena said. “If you wanted to start a family or something, you couldn’t really do that.” While cases of couples meeting in medical school and even raising families before they graduate exist, the stress of medical school can only complicate the lives of newlyweds and parents who are still getting the hang of changing diapers.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, pre-med is not for everyone. While UCSB has a reputable biology department and pretty strong pre-medical program, Tobolowsky said, success in these programs requires a student who is desperate to reach medical school. “I think the classes here really prepare you well and they’re very in depth, but most of all, it really depends on your approach to the courses,” he said. Saying he is perfectly willing to work hard, Tobolowsky said the sacrifices are well worth it, as is the need to “be nerdy,” because he cannot imagine anything else that would make him happier than becoming a doctor.</p>\n<p>Sitting at a glass table on the third floor of the Life Sciences Building, Tobolowsky looked down at the timer on his phone. One minute and 24 seconds later, he closed his biology textbook, stood up and went to check on his bacteria.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of November 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/","id":3487,"author":{"id":191,"name":"Hannah Nelson"},"related":[3486,3485,3484],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Protesters Express Outrage Over Napolitano’s Exclusive Meeting with UCSB ‘Student Leaders’","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Chanting mantras like “Undocumented, Unafraid!” and “Hey hey, ho ho, Napolitano’s got to go!”, UCSB students rallied in opposition to the appointment of UC President Janet Napolitano, who wi...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Chanting mantras like “Undocumented, Unafraid!” and “Hey hey, ho ho, Napolitano’s got to go!”, UCSB students rallied in opposition to the appointment of UC President Janet Napolitano, who will be attending a closed meeting with “student leaders” today.</p>\n<p>Students are expressing outrage at the exclusivity of the meeting — which will take place at 9 a.m. at Mosher Alumni House — and are demanding that Napolitano take part in an open forum welcome to all students. The meeting was organized by administrators in the Division of Student Affairs and Associated Students officials, and 35 students — including representatives such as the Interfraternity Council President and A.S. president — will participate. The meeting will be closed off to other students.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, students marched from the Student Resource Building to the Faculty Lounge, demanding a public forum with the newly appointed UC president, who was the Secretary of Homeland Security before becoming the new leader of the UC system.</p>\n<p>Napolitano’s appointment, which came in July, has largely received backlash from many students since she is the first UC president to lack a background in education, previously acting as the governor as well as attorney general of Arizona. She has also drawn much criticism from the undocumented immigrant student community since she spearheaded the controversial Secure Communities program during her time as Secretary of Homeland Security. The deportation program seeks out undocumented immigrants using fingerprints by provided the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to the site for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and deported around two million undocumented immigrants — including non-criminal persons — during Napolitano’s term.</p>\n<p>At yesterday’s protest, student held up a giant banner highlighting the “No” in “Napolitano,” students from UCSB’s I.D.E.A.S. — or Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success — as well as other campus organizations, marched past UC Police Department officers and CSOs until finally arriving to the Faculty Lounge, where they were met by Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead. After criticizing Napolitano on her implementation of record-breaking deportation programs as former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, students asked Yang and Armistead if there could be a public forum allowing more students to speak than the few “student leaders” selected by administrators.</p>\n<p>I.D.E.A.S. member and second-year student Abigail Salazar said many undocumented students on campus have been directly affected by Napolitano’s deportation programs, herself included.</p>\n<p>“With all due respect, this is a person who has invaded my home, who has destroyed my family and I wasn’t even invited [to the meeting],” Salazar said. “I want to direct a lot of feelings that I have towards her. I have that right.”</p>\n<p>Salazar also said administration’s decision to hold a private meeting instead of a public forum with Napolitano further insulted the undocumented student community.</p>\n<p>“I command you, Chancellor Yang, to hold a public forum,” Salazar said. “We’re not going anywhere … we will not stand by this any longer. Do you understand us? With all respect, do you understand us?”</p>\n<p>In response to student demands, Armistead said Napolitano would leave right after tomorrow morning’s private meeting and that there was thus “not enough time for a public forum.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure that everybody who was picked is happy to have an open forum,” Armistead said. “They actually want to have a dialogue, and the concern is — that this happens within the public forum, then nothing can happen and you can’t have a conversation.”</p>\n<p>Attendees of tomorrow’s meeting include A.S. executive officials, leaders of campus organizations such as Human Rights Board, I.D.E.A.S. and S.C.O.R.E., or Student Commission on Racial Equality, as well as members of Greek life. However, some of the students invited are not currently the head of any campus group, according to Mario Vasquez, a member of Human Rights Board.</p>\n<p>Chicano Studies professor Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, who joined students in protesting today, said he has taught many students who have dealt with deportation on a personal level. He said student demonstrations should push Napolitano to support the undocumented student community and advocate for immigration policy reform.</p>\n<p>“She could apologize for what she did, and she could put pressure on the Obama administration to stop what it’s doing,” Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval said. “It’s nearly deported two million people, which is more people combined than any other in U.S. history.”</p>\n<p>Napolitano has also expressed support for the DREAM Act and undocumented students, and she recently devoted $5 million in UC funding to financial aid and special counseling for undocumented UC students, according to a UC Office of the President press release.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Norma Orozco expressed opposition to the appointment of Napolitano both because of her experience in the Department of Homeland Security and her lack of professional academic experience.</p>\n<p>“This is the president of our university.

Pardall Center — a center at 6550 Pardall that will be funded by student money and will be open to A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>So far, student officials have not extensively publicized the opening of the space to the general UCSB community, although the center will be entirely funded by student fees. The student government also discussed student support for UC workers, bicycle and skateboard safety and IGNITE, a program that stands for “Invest in Graduations, Not Incarceration. Transform Education.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting Associate Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones introduced recently hired staff member for the A.S. Pardall Center Jeanette Lyden, who will be staffing the first floor of the building from noon to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday for the next several months. He said Lyden will be there to “to provide a more consistent presence,” inviting students in A.S. organizations — known as Boards, Committees or Commissions, or BCCs — to stop by and utilize the space.</p>\n<p>Rent for the space costs $5,000 per month and is currently open to A.S. students and members of BCCs. No concrete plan for funding has been formed, although the center will be paid by student fees regardless. Senator Amir Khazaieli has been working closely with an Ad-Hoc committee to search for which groups will contribute funds to the center over the next two years.</p>\n<p>Jones encouraged students to “utilize and hang out in the space” and to continue to visualize what the space will be used for, recalling a recent instance by which the space was used.</p>\n<p>“Just last night, CAB helped to co-sponsor the event with a frat or sorority or another org … where they had a carnival for youth in Isla Vista, and it was packed,” Jones said. “They had game stations set up all throughout the first floor, food, popcorn, games, it was great.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting, student officials also spoke about the UC workers’ strike earlier in the day, which drew hundreds of participants campus wide.</p>\n<p>Senator John Soriano spoke on behalf of UC service and patient care workers, highlighting the economic discrepancy between campus workers’ wages and wages of the national average. According to Soriano, university employees deserve better wages and pension pay than they are currently receiving.</p>\n<p>“Because our employees make so little money, our employees qualify for many public benefits, including MediCal, food stamps, housing subsidies and childcare subsidies,” Soriano said. <b></b></p>\n<p>In addition, a resolution in support of A.S. Bike Awareness Week — concerning pedestrian, skateboard and bicycle safety — was tabled. With a $90,000 budget, A.S. Bike Committee is currently looking outward for more funding assistance for their bike safety campaign causing Senators to argue over their request for more funding for items such as American Apparel t-shirts.</p>\n<p>IGNITE — or “Invest in Graduation, Not Incarceration. Transform Education” — discussed decreased funding for UC education in relation to increased funding for incarcerations. IGNITE is working to reverse issues facing UC students by passing three bills that aim to reprioritize education over prison spending.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, November 21, 2013’s print version of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/","id":3068,"author":{"id":193,"name":"Elliott Wright"},"related":[3067,3066,3065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Attend Conference at UCLA Despite Funding Controversy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB students attended a three-day-long “Students of Color Conference” at UCLA, after students planning the trip struggled to attain funding when some student government officials said money was b...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB students attended a three-day-long “Students of Color Conference” at UCLA, after students planning the trip struggled to attain funding when some student government officials said money was being allocated unfairly.</p>\n<p>The Students of Color Conference (SOCC) is an annual UCSA event in which students are able to host workshops, listen to speakers and discuss ideas with their peers at other UC campuses. The UCSB Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) sent a delegation of students to the conference — led by Hani Tajsar, a fourth-year Middle Eastern studies major, and Navkiran Kaur, a third-year sociology and Black studies double major. The trip received $7,000 from Associated Students Finance Board for attendees to go to the event, but then struggled to hold onto the funding when other A.S. officials questioned how S.C.O.R.E. was selecting which attendees were permitted to go.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, S.C.O.R.E. asked elected A.S. officials to pay from their allocated budgets to attend the event. S.C.O.R.E. received too many applicants than could be accommodated so the organization asked A.S. officials to pay since they have access to funding that is not available to other students, Kaur said.</p>\n<p>“We wanted elected officials to pay because that way we would have been able to take more first- and second-year students who wouldn’t have had the means to go, otherwise, on the trip with us,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, A.S. Attorney General Sawyeh Maghsoodloo said the blocked funding for the delegation was based on discrimination.</p>\n<p>“The Attorney General said that S.C.O.R.E. was discriminating against people in elected positions by making them use their funds to pay for the conference, but the Finance Board ended up disregarding that,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Jonathan Abboud, Finance Board asked Senate to make a final decision or come to a compromise. In response, the students came to a compromise by adding A.S. Senators to the waiting list for the delegation and giving some Senate funding to those who did not get off the waiting list. Abboud, Maghsoodloo and another A.S. official attended the conference using funds from the A.S. Office of the President.</p>\n<p>Maghsoodloo commented on the negotiation in an email, stating Finance Board “broke financial policy with their selection process, so there was a compromise resolution to erase those harms caused by the exclusion of all elected officials from the conference delegation.”</p>\n<p>Abboud conceded that S.C.O.R.E. was justified in asking elected A.S. officials to use other funds, but expressed discontent with the fact that S.C.O.R.E. made this request after applications were already submitted.</p>\n<p>“It was retroactive. It was after the applications were submitted,” Abboud said. “I feel like if they had been more proactive and said, ‘Hey, Senate, we’d really appreciate if you paid for whoever applied from Senate,’ that would have been the best way to go about it.”</p>\n<p>Apart from funding issues and in regards to the conference as a whole, Kaur said the event was necessary for students who did not feel comfortable expressing their voice in a normal campus setting.</p>\n<p>“At school, oftentimes, there is no space to express yourself,” Kaur said. “At the conference, students were empowered to share their ideas and share whatever was on their minds.”</p>\n<p>As with every annual SOCC conference, UCSA stages some sort of action, protest or rally. This year, UCSA transformed its F.I.R.E. (Fighting Incarceration, Reclaiming Education) campaign into an I.G.N.I.T.E. campaign (Invest in Graduations, Not Incarceration, Transforming Education).</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, a major focus of I.G.N.I.T.E. is to reexamine the way prisons are structured in the United States. She said a large and concerning discrepancy exists between the funding allocated to education and the funding allocated to prisons.</p>\n<p>“In the past 20 years, California has built 22 prisons but only one university,” Kaur said. “Most of the people incarcerated in these prisons are black and brown people. We need to shift our focus so that we can get these people out of prisons and back into school, so they can have a future.”</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, second-year sociology major and a member of S.C.O.R.E. who attended at the conference, echoed Kaur’s statement. He also said a key aspect of SOCC is the workshops and caucuses they hold for attendees. This year’s workshops aimed to highlight the associations between social justice struggles that are otherwise viewed as irrelevant.</p>\n<p>“A major focus in many of the workshops was connecting the struggles of people of color,” Mirza said. “One workshop connected the Philippines to Gaza to Latin America. Another dealt with the issue of decolonizing textbooks.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said the conference allowed students to attack some of the issues they currently face, but in a safe setting.</p>\n<p>“Students of color are often silenced and their issues are tossed aside or completely ignored,” Mirza said. “Going to conferences like this helps the general UCSB community because it can help us address some of the problems we have.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>—Tiana Miller-Leonard contributed to this article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Wednesday, November 20, 2013 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53121\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53121\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-20/students-attend-conference-at-ucla-despite-funding-controversy/","id":3067,"author":{"id":184,"name":"Aditya Tadanki"},"related":[3066,3065,3064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

In addition to the relief resolution, senators listened to a presentation on student debt, postponed taking a stance on a UC worker strike and supported changes to the California Master Plan for Higher Education.  </p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Nikki Calderon, who helped draft the resolution along with Off-campus Senator Beatrice Contreras, said there is a pressing need for more monetary allocations toward the relief fund, as she explained the nature of the catastrophe.</p>\n<p>“It’s estimated that there’s over 10,000 dead, and that’s just from the initial storm itself,” Calderon said. “This relief money is severely needed.”</p>\n<p>However, senators spent over an hour and a half feuding over the details of the bill, with some students not in favor of committing two hours of their week to help collect funds. In response, Contreras expressed exasperation with her peers.</p>\n<p>“I’m frustrated that this is taking so long,” Contreras said. “While we’re here debating this, there are literally people dying.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she felt it was unfair to other items on the agenda to spend such a disproportionate amount of time on the Typhoon resolution.</p>\n<p>“We spent over one hour on one resolution,” MacLachlan said. “And then the rest of the resolutions that were on the table, we only talked about for five or 10 minutes that were completely important … I think that we need to just remember that they all need their fair amount of distribution.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the resolution passed with a fundraising goal of $5,000, as proposed by On-campus Senator Colton Bentz.</p>\n<p>Amongst other items debated more briefly was a resolution in support of revising the current California Master Plan for Higher Education, which was first implemented in 1960. A.S. President Jonathan Abboud and External Vice President of Student Affairs Alex Choate advocated in favor of the revision at the meeting, pointing out the outdated goals of the current plan.  </p>\n<p>“I want to emphasize how important passing this resolution is,” Abboud said. “Please pass this, and if it’s passed, make a big deal about it.”</p>\n<p>Senators swiftly passed the resolution with little debate.</p>\n<p>Additionally at the meeting, Federal Policy Analyst Monte Richardson gave a short presentation on federal student loan debt, focusing on UCSB in particular.</p>\n<p>“In 2011, the average student load debt was $18,627 dollars, which is a little bit lower than the national average,” Richardson said. “The proportion of students with debt was 49 percent, which is a little bit less than half — just around the nation average.”</p>\n<p>A bill in support of UC workers on strike was tabled for a week due to a lack of data being provided, according to Off-campus Senator Nick Onyshko. Although senators are given a meeting agenda in advance so as to prepare accordingly, Onyshko said presenters should have provided more basic information to senators.</p>\n<p>“The lack of figures presented by the organizers was quite disconcerting,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>Several other resolutions were quickly passed with little to no debate, including a resolution requesting check-ins between UCPD and the A.S. Senate, a resolution funding a university housing forum and minor updates to the legal codes for Human Rights Board and Isla Vista Community Relations Committee.</p>\n<p>Other projects discussed at the meeting included new bike paths and racks and progress on the “Rate My Landlord” website, amongst others.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53024\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53024\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/","id":3065,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3064,3063,3062],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Proposed Fundraising To Aid Philippine Relief Effort","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines last week and left roughly 2,300 dead, Associated Students will vote on a resolution to begin a fundraising event that will collect money every day at the A...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines last week and left roughly 2,300 dead, Associated Students will vote on a resolution to begin a fundraising event that will collect money every day at the Arbor, University Center and the lawn of the Student Resource Building from today until next Thursday.</p>\n<p>If passed, all donated funds will go directly to the National Alliance for Filipino Concerns, or NAFCON, a Seattle-based group that will send aid to a relief and rehabilitation organization with access to disaster victims. A.S. also plans to allow online donations through a PayPal account on their website, if donors are unable to give funds in person.</p>\n<p>A.S. Off-Campus Senator Beatrice Contreras, who is spearheading the resolution, said she was inspired to propose the resolution after hearing about the A.S. charity drive for the 2010 Haiti earthquake, through which A.S. raised $55,000. She also said she hopes the Filipino community on campus will help motivate relief efforts for the recent disaster, which has so far affected an estimated 9.5 million people.</p>\n<p>“I was inspired to do this because we have a significant Filipino population at UCSB and many people have family members that live in areas hit by the typhoon,” Contreras, a sociology and Asian American studies double major, said.</p>\n<p>Working together with campus Filipino organization Kapatirang Pilipino, also known as “Filipino Brotherhood/Sisterhood,” Associated Students hopes to raise $25,000 in student donations, which they will then match with their own funds, bringing the total goal up to $50,000, if the resolution passes.</p>\n<p>Although funds raised would typically go to the Red Cross chapter of the Philippines, A.S. Senator and second-year political science and communication double major Nikki Calderon, who is co-sponsoring the resolution, said this will not be the case since the Red Cross chapter has a reputation for misusing funds.</p>\n<p>“The Philippines’ Red Cross was objected to be used by the Filipino community here because in past years, it had been discovered that [this chapter] was stealing funds for employee personal use and the money was not being sent as aid,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Calderon said the only relief organization that currently has access to most of the affected areas is UNICEF. However, only two military planes have been able to land in the region surrounding Tacloban — the worst-hit city — so far, meaning aid is arriving very slowly. As a result, Calderon said Associated Students needs to expedite the fundraising process in order to deliver donations to victims as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>For students like first-year biology major Nila Nathan, UCSB students have a duty to support populations abroad that are underprivileged or suffering from natural disasters.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s vital to donate because we are lucky to have so much, and it’s important to show those who are less fortunate that we care,” Nathan said.</p>\n<p>In an effort to raise additional funds for relief efforts, Kapatirang Pilipino plans to host an event called “The Benefit Open Mic Night” next Monday at the MultiCultural Center Theater. For those unable to donate money, the organization will also be accepting clothing, blankets and other necessities on the second floor of Embarcadero Hall next Monday through Friday.</p>\n<p>UCSB alum and New Student Requirement Coordinator for the Alcohol and Drug Program Marjan Riazi, who is spearheading the clothing and blanket drive, said she was motivated to create the event when she learned that some of her own family members were affected by the typhoon.</p>\n<p>“Our land was destroyed, but even worse is the fact that the homes of our 40 farmers and their families have been destroyed,” Riazi said. “These people literally have nothing. They are waiting for safety, but even after this storm subsides, they still have to pick up the pieces and rebuild all of their homes.”</p>\n<p>In light of such drastic circumstances and suffering, Riazi said relief efforts will be long and strenuous, so she is working to build support on campus and offer as much aid as possible.</p>\n<p>“This is going to be over a year-long process and this is only one story,” she said. “There are millions of people suffering in the Philippines so I feel more than obligated to do my part and help in whatever way I can.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, November 14, 2013 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52960\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52960\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/proposed-fundraising-to-aid-philippine-relief-effort/","id":3066,"author":{"id":194,"name":"Chelsea Brandwein"},"related":[3065,3064,3063],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

In addition, the executive officers delivered reports updating the Senate on news from their offices.</p>\n<p>External Vice President for Local Affairs Alex Moore briefly recapped Halloween, saying this year’s festivities were milder than anticipated.</p>\n<p>“It was overall a smaller Halloween than we thought,” Moore said. “For a Thursday night Halloween, it was really kind of controlled.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud addressed the Senate regarding his recent meeting with the campus planning committee, expressing frustration at the resistance he encountered towards his plans for a UCen renovation.</p>\n<p>“Our project is $25 million and there were other projects that are $150 million and our project was the only one that was questioned and criticized,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>He said the university is in “critical” need of “a student services building that provides much-needed resources,” saying there should be more support for such a facility, in light of the campus funding a $150 million engineering building.</p>\n<p>Associated Student Food Bank advisors Tuyen Nguyen and Erick Lankey reported to the Senate on the expanding operations of the organization. Nguyen said the food bank is going to move beyond non-perishable goods to include more fresh produce.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to make sure students have access to healthier foods, which is what we’re working on.” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>Some of the bills that passed included one to provide $3,000 in funding for the UCSB men’s club soccer team to travel to the National Tournament in Phoenix, Arizona, in addition to a motion to provide $3,000 in funding for the Pi Beta Phi Foundation lip-sync contest that will be held in Campbell Hall, raising money to provide books to underprivileged children.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she supported the event on the grounds of the number of students expected to attend.</p>\n<p>“There’s more than 850 students that attend this event and that’s a pretty significant portion of the student body,” MacLachlan said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also passed a resolution to organize fundraising for an endowment that would grant a scholarship to undocumented students, introduced by Senator Marvin Ramirez. Senators also established a group project to create a landlord rating website to protect students from unfair property owners and managers. The project intends to work with multiple on campus organizations and groups.</p>\n<p>Finally, plans were discussed to establish an A.S. YouTube channel that would allow for live streaming of student senate meetings to make the proceedings more accessible to the general student body. The live streaming meetings are part of an effort to increase A.S. Senate transparency and they come in light of one student addressing the governmental body’s alleged failure to connect with students. Jimmy Villarreal said that he appreciated the criticism, saying “I want to thank you for coming in and holding us accountable.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1516561681\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"52880\"><img data-attachment-id=\"52882\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/as-senate_11-06-2013_kenneth-song-8940/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1383773729\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"85\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth song-8940\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-52882\" alt=\"AS Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth song-8940\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/","id":3064,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3063,3062,3061],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Soriano said he plans to mount a giant projector screen right over San Miguel stage, which would cost around $7,000. According to Soriano, the project is relatively inexpensive and will pay for itself in less than three uses.</p>\n<p>Even though a mural is slated to be painted on the wall where the projector screen will be mounted, Soriano explained the screen would not get in the way of students’ ability to enjoy the mural as it could be easily rolled up and stored. Soriano said the screen would be available for use for any student in the residence halls who can provide their own projector and extension cable.</p>\n<p>“All the buildings have their own projector set and an extension cord,” Soriano said. “Bringing the projector just beyond the stage is good enough to have a reasonably sized image.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Collegiate Senator for the College of Engineering Amir Khazaieli discussed the current status of the A.S. annex in I.V. and upcoming plans for its use. The ad hoc committee dedicated to the annex, of which Khazaieli is chair, has been overseeing the development of the space for the past three years. Although the funding for the annex comes from funds that are paid by all students, the annex will only be available to A.S. groups that make appointments beforehand.</p>\n<p>Stakeholders — such as A.S. committees — and student fees currently cover the cost of leasing space.</p>\n<p>“It’s easier to arrange through an A.S. group, but all students are allowed and encouraged to use the space as well,” Khazaieli said. “Student fees are already being used to pay the lease. Every student is technically a stakeholder in the space and we are really trying to respect that.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said A.S. groups will hold a survey over the next two weeks to get a better idea of what the community wants from the space.</p>\n<p>Additionally at the meeting, member of A.S. Community Financial Fund Jose Raygoza spoke about different grants and supplemental loans available to students. Last year, according to Raygoza, $82,330 was given out and divided into 227 grants. Raygoza said he has noticed a trend that indicates that grants are more in demand, meaning that it will become more difficult for students to receive any.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has an equal chance to apply, but applicants are chosen on a first-come, first-serve basis,” Raygoza said.</p>\n<p>Raygoza said CFF is looking into ways of finding more money for grants. Senators also discussed adding additional tables to the dining commons, the ongoing process of adding a Gender and Sexuality General Education requirement and logistics surrounding the hydration stations that will be set up during Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/","id":3063,"author":{"id":193,"name":"Elliott Wright"},"related":[3062,3061,3060],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Senate Discusses Halloween, New UC President","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Wednesday night’s Associated Students Senate meeting addressed a wide range of A.S. projects, including the logistics of Halloween preparation and new developments with U.C.

President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore spoke about safety preparations for Isla Vista’s notoriously massive Halloween festivities. Moore reported the idea of temporary fencing he hoped to install along the cliffs of Del Playa Drive to prevent cliff fall injuries or deaths was shut down due to funding issues as well as liability concerns, from the University’s Office of Risk Management.</p>\n<p>Moore said he was frustrated with the decision but is determined to continue working on the issue, as he remains confident in achieving future success.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to be moving forward to negotiate with the county on some sort of framework or method, so that this doesn’t happen again [and] so that we can always have temporary fencing during high-risk events,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>He also mentioned the Festival ordinance that will be in effect from this Saturday until Nov. 4, saying he and other groups are working to make students aware of the ordinance and other changes. “We’re doing everything we can to make sure folks don’t get an unnecessary ticket,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Moore said hydration stations and portable bathrooms will be set up for each night of Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, executive officers and public forum speakers delivered reports on their recent accomplishments and upcoming activities.</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud discussed his recent meeting with new U.C. President Napolitano in Oakland on Monday during his report, in which he expressed positive results that included promises from her to meet with the elected members of campus governments in person once a quarter and to speak to them on the phone once per month.</p>\n<p>In addition, Abboud said he was pleased with their success in getting Napolitano to address the skyrocketing cost of tuition.</p>\n<p>“She did well, in terms of answering what we wanted but we did corner her on a couple of things we wanted … like Prop 13,” Abboud said. “So we got her to admit that Prop 13 is one of the reasons tuition has gotten so high.”</p>\n<p>Along with the passing of a few minor bills, the meeting tabled a bill sending directives to Napolitano. Towards the end of the meeting, Senators debated the bill, concluding they would clarify the language and demands of the drafted proposal and vote on it next week.</p>\n<p>One section of the bill prohibits the use of U.C. funds to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to Senator Nikki Calderon, currently no U.C. funds go toward assisting ICE, but the bill ensures that these funds will not be used in the future. This section Calderon said, serves to secure that the funding “may not be happening, but it will not happen also.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included a tree-planting event Saturday at Goleta Valley Beautiful, planned homeless assistance in I.V. provided by Pescadero Lofts and efforts to make the dining commons Kosher-friendly. For next week’s meeting, Senate members will come dressed in their Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This story is a </em>Daily Nexus<em> online exclusive.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52629\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52629\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/","id":3062,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3061,3060,3059],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":143,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
