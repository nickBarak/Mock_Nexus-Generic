continue their work, it must be conducted remotely until the outbreak is contained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers were given two days to cease any ongoing on-campus research, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.research.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/docs/covid-19/Shutdown-of-All-On-Campus-Research-3-18-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">memo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Incandela sent out on March 18. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The shutdown of on-campus research will create unanticipated delays, which can be cause for significant anxiety for many, and especially junior, researchers,” Incandela wrote in the memo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While there is no way to escape the loss of time, every effort is being made to assure that these actions will not damage careers or lead to excessive financial hardship,” he continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the memo does provide some exceptions to the remote research mandate, including those who are researching coronavirus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Requests to allow COVID-19 studies or the continuation of ongoing essential experiments” can be submitted through a form for consideration, the memo read, but “few exceptions [are] to be granted.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research equipment, such as chemicals, are not allowed to be taken off campus. For laboratories or equipment that require continued maintenance or activity, the memo asks researchers to “spell out why and what continued tasks are necessary and identify a minimum number of essential personnel who will be responsible for this critical maintenance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incandela said funding for researchers’ pay was a concern early on, but that the federal</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> agencies, which provide most of the funding for researchers, would continue to fund research now conducted at home. </span><a href=\"https://www.research.ucsb.edu/covid-19-guidance-proposals-and-awards\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New information</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding employee wages is being made available to researchers as well, Incandela said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mahdi Abu-Omar, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry whose research focuses on renewable energy, said that despite the shutdown, there’s still a lot of work to be done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re experimentalists, but there’s work that we do offline in terms of writing papers and preparing and planning and processing data,” Abu-Omar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course not being able to do experiments is holding us back a little bit.

The alleged data thieves have since been arrested, according to the notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement did not specify whether it was Santa Barbara city or county police that notified the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe &amp; Associates said it was notified by police on March 23 about the potentially affected applicants, including a list of their email addresses. According to Wolfe &amp; Associates, these individuals have been notified about the data breach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Erin Valenzuela, a third-year communications and philosophy double major, only one person in her four-person Wolfe &amp; Associates-managed apartment had been notified about the data breach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I found out more from twitter than I did from them,” she wrote in a message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fourth-year student who leased with Wolfe &amp; Associates from 2016-18, and asked not to be named because they intend to pursue legal action, said in a message that “The main concern is the cosigners. If my data was breached, my parents are my cosigners so the likelihood of their socials being taken as well are very high.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individuals who applied for apartments managed by Wolfe &amp; Associates after February 2018 have not been impacted by the breach, and payment information was not compromised in the breach, according to Scott Wolfe, vice president of Wolfe &amp; Associates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe also said that people who have been “potentially impacted” by the breach have been notified and that Wolfe &amp; Associates has been “working to respond to a number of inquiries.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email sent out to impacted Wolfe &amp; Associates residents, the agency recommended that tenants “notify the police department of any unusual activity” and to “check with credit bureaus, financial institutions, and insurance companies that you do business with.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe &amp; Associates also recommended in the email that tenants change their passwords for bank accounts, credit cards and “any other entity that you have financial dealings with.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the company encouraged those affected to sign up for credit monitoring services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have arranged to offer monitoring service with NortonLifeLock at no cost to you for a period of one year,” the company wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The leasing agency also said to report any unusual activity to the SBPD case agent, Detective Rapp, as well as individuals’ financial institutions, such as credit card companies. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

P/NP policies will help students through the tumultuous changes brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new policy, which was detailed in an email sent to students on Wednesday, was created to mitigate the impact that the coronavirus could have on academic performance and reduce anxiety among students due to the various devastating impacts of the virus, according to Henning Bohn, divisional chair of UCSB’s Academic Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pass/no pass (P/NP) grade does not impact a student’s GPA, and if a department opts in to the grading change by April 17, students can take certain courses as P/NP that previously they could take only for letter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students normally have to decide to have their classes graded P/NP by week seven but can now make the switch anytime up until June 5, the last day of spring quarter instruction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students on academic probation cannot take classes P/NP, and veterans using the GI bill may have to repay money to Veteran’s Affairs if they receive an NP grade, the email continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, Bohn expressed concern that students could overlook possible disadvantages that sometimes come with the P/NP grading option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have very, very mixed feelings. Pass/no pass is something that students should only take when it is to their advantage,” Bohn said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] should probably talk to an academic advisor first to make sure that it’s a wise choice,” he added, citing the possible repercussions students could face when applying to graduate schools.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law schools will recalculate NP grades to an “F” letter grade, according to the email, and many graduate schools could hold unfavorable views on P/NP marks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate schools have a variety of opinions and standards regarding P/NP grades, according to Claudio Campagnari, chair of UCSB’s Department of Physics.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that anybody looking at graduate applications would understand that spring 2020 is a weird time, but who knows?” Campagnari said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that if it were up to him, he would have preferred a mandatory P/NP system for every class, which many schools, like </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/03/20/uc-berkeley-spring-2020-undergraduate-courses-default-to-pass-no-pass-grading/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley</span></a><span

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Stanford</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have adopted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campagnari is optimistic that the new P/NP policies will help students through the tumultuous changes brought on by the coronavirus pandemic but acknowledges that the quarter will likely continue to see more obstacles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really going to be a weird quarter,” Campagnari said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alli Adam, internal vice president of Associated Students, said she hopes that the new P/NP policy will work to alleviate some of the academic burden placed on students, especially those with tenuous access to the internet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students have been put in unfair situations and I would hate to see it negatively affect anybody’s GPA because they don’t have the proper resources now that remote classes are happening,” Adam said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

for fall 2020 who are unable to meet official transcript deadlines and will instead hold their admission status until transcripts are received by the campuses, through the first day of class,

Typically, students are required to submit their high school transcripts to the UCs by July 1. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transfer students will also be able to bypass the usual limit on the number of units graded “pass/no pass” that can be transferred to UC to meet the minimum unit requirement for junior standing, according to the press release.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The measures are temporary but could apply to students affected by the coronavirus pandemic “for future years as applicable,” according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes come after many </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-01/coronavirus-school-closures-california\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">high schools in the U.S. have been forced to shut down</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or move classes online, with some schools opting to grade units on a “pass/no pass” or “credit/no credit” basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These modifications, as well as the </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-20/all-about-standardized-testing-delays-due-to-coronavirus\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cancellation of standardized testing and college entrance exams</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the country, “had the potential to adversely affect not only the incoming freshman class, but all high school students seeking a UC education, making it challenging to meet University requirements,” according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCOP’s decision to relax the SAT and ACT requirements due to the coronavirus pandemic comes two months after the UC Academic Senate recommended that the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC continue to require standardized testing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for admissions applications. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano is expected to make her own recommendation to the UC Board of Regents for a final decision on standardized testing – a decision separate from the temporary coronavirus pandemic UC measures – in May, the Nexus reported in February. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-93746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">VSS invites spokespeople from companies such as Invoca’s Director of Sales Development Anders Vazquez. <em>Courtesy of Trent Waltz</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History of public policy and law major Trent Waltz said he came up with the idea for such a program while he was interning at the Vendition Sales Society (VSS), a nonprofit national collegiate club for students interested in a sales career. Waltz, who is the co-creator and head of the organization’s UCSB chapter, said that the club’s main focus is to run sales events that include guest speakers and panels. VSS also hosts instructional workshops and invites spokespeople from companies like Procore and Tesla, who speak to students about what it’s like to work in sales after college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the club offers a number of resources, Waltz explained that the program’s singular goal is to help “fellow Gauchos get a foot in the door in an increasingly competitive job market.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While interning for VSS this past summer, Waltz met the people who would soon work with him to bring his idea for the Collegiate Sales Certification (CSC) program to life. These other interns went on to set up CSC programs at their own schools too: UC Berkeley student Michael Williams became head of the UC Berkeley chapter, Shannon Chau, head of the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo chapter and JennaRae DeMaio, head of the San Diego State chapter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waltz said that he is adamant about making sure that all of the program’s events hold a purpose and provide helpful tools and information to students. But in terms of obstacles, exposure and consistency are big ones, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being that [this] is a new campus org … having that momentum is so key to really keeping a club going,” Waltz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coronavirus pandemic, however, has put a hold on the club’s meetings and workshops. To accommodate this change, Waltz said that he and his team are working to adapt the in-person workshops that were scheduled for spring into an online format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Waltz, the program functions on three main pillars: structuring an opportunity, salesforce certification and cold-calling tactics. The first focuses on creating sales opportunities, invoking responses and cadence structure — using language to convince customers to open up, creating an opportunity to make a sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second pillar entails creating a new contact and taking them all the way from new lead to opportunity and close. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third pillar is the cold-calling skill, where students practice nearly 200 cold calls to familiarize themselves with the process.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the program is designed for students to pick and choose what modules and workshops they want to complete, they “don’t have to do the entire thing,” Waltz said, adding that modular learning eliminates the hassle of having to sit through workshops that aren’t of interest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want this club to be something that can benefit the entirety of the UCSB student body. My vision [is to make] sure that us Gauchos are that much better prepared to go out into the real world and have that competitive edge,” Waltz said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/","id":1815,"author":{"id":256,"name":"KJ Clay"},"related":[1814,1813,1812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Moratoriums on Evictions Due to COVID-19 Issued on Statewide and County Level","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2020-03-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_6266.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_6266.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Evictions may only be halted if the tenant cannot pay rent because of coronavirus, according to the statewide executive order.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an executive order on March 27, Governor Gavin Newsom placed a statewide moratorium on evictions to ensure that those who cannot pay rent due to income loss from the coronavirus will not be evicted from their residences. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91087\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91087\" data-attachment-id=\"91087\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-07/over-40-former-tenants-sued-isla-vista-luxury-living-over-security-deposit-disputes-and-won/dsc_6266/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_6266.jpg?fit=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1363\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"I.V.

This includes a tenant or family member being sick with coronavirus, a tenant being laid off or losing hours or a tenant having to miss work to look after their child. In Santa Barbara County, all K-12 schools are closed as a result of coronavirus, the </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/03/13/santa-barbara-county-k-12-schools-closing-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, similar to other counties across the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid eviction, the tenant must provide their landlord with documentation that shows their inability to pay rent, such as an employment termination notice or a bank statement, according to the executive order. Additionally, the tenant must notify their landlord in writing that they are unable to pay rent at least seven days prior to rent being due.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No tenants are exempt from paying their rent entirely, however; the executive order only stops evictions. Tenants must pay all the rent they missed after the May 31 deadline or they will then face eviction, according to the statewide order.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County eviction moratorium shares the May 31 deadline and also stipulates that the ordinance only protects against eviction and does not excuse any tenants from paying rent back at a later time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People who can pay rent should pay rent, but we cannot allow people to get evicted at a time </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when it will spread the sickness and endanger us all,” 1st District Supervisor Das Williams said in a press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams, who authored the ordinance alongside 2nd District Supervisor Gregg Hart, said during the meeting that the ordinance is a necessary step to prevent the rise of houselessness and the spread of coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If there were a large number of evictions, we would either have more people congregating as homeless, or more people congregating in the homes of friends and family,” Williams said. “That is not a good thing for limiting the spread of coronavirus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ordinance has legal limitations as to who is and who is not protected by the moratorium, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">County Counsel Michael C. Ghizzoni, who spoke at the supervisors meeting about the legal implication of the ordinance, said</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, tenants must notify their landlords that they have been economically impacted specifically by the coronavirus pandemic, not for any other reasons. Additionally, the ordinance does “not prohibit</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the landlord pursuing a payment of rent through any of the other causes of action that they have,” Ghizzoni said, meaning that the supervisors are only restricting landlords from evicting tenants, not from other warning actions against tenants not paying rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many community members showed support for the moratorium over the phone and through email, but some worried about the burden of tenants having to pay back missed rent after the protections expire in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Appelbaum, a UCSB professor emeritus in the global studies department, voiced his concern in an email to the Board of Supervisors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realize that landlords need to be made whole once this passes; but tenants who were unemployed will have lost the income that would otherwise be used for the missed rental payments,” Appelbaum wrote. “Somehow, they should be protected.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Supervisors does not have the authority to provide financial support to people who have lost jobs, 5th District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino said. Residents should instead count on the national government for unemployment help, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that’s a little over our pay-grade at the county level, but keep your eyes on that federal stimulus package,” Lavagnino said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ordinance only protects unincorporated areas of the county, but individual cities within Santa Barbara County have already taken action to prevent evictions during the pandemic, including Goleta, Santa Barbara and Ojai. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because I.V. is unincorporated territory in Santa Barbara County, any protections for I.V. residents must come from the countywide level.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yang sent out an email Tuesday afternoon notifying students about the case in Isla Vista, adding that the case was “a previously confirmed case of COVID-19 [which] was found to be located within the boundaries of the Isla Vista community” after the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department began using GIS mapping to identify confirmed cases.</p>\n<p>“<strong>We have no indication that this case involves anyone affiliated with UC Santa Barbara</strong>, but given the proximity of Isla Vista to campus, the number of our students who live in Isla Vista, and our faculty and staff who live in Isla Vista or adjacent communities, we wanted to notify our campus community of this development,” Yang wrote.</p>\n<p>Yang also added that two people affiliated with UCSB who live together tested positive for coronavirus after one returned from Europe on March 13.</p>\n<p>“<strong>Both individuals have not been on campus and have been in self-quarantine since March 13.</strong> They currently remain in self-quarantine off campus and are recovering,” Yang wrote.</p>\n<p>At the Monday afternoon press conference, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henning Ansorg, the Santa Barbara Public Health Department public health officer, said the rise in cases in Santa Barbara County had been expected by the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The increase in numbers is very typical for a virus that spreads quickly from person to person. We expected a doubling of cases within three days and that is almost exactly what we have seen,” Ansorg said. “It is an indicator of just how infectious this thing is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to slow the continued rise of cases and mitigate the spread of the virus, Ansorg also emphasized the necessity of social distancing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only definitive factor which makes a substantial difference between the best and worst case scenario is how much community members stay physically isolated from each other. Continuing with our current efforts of social distancing will make all the difference,” Ansorg said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Ansorg did not specifically mention the I.V. case during the conference, it was announced about two hours later through the Santa Barbara Public Health Department </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBCPublicHealth/status/1244799094272471042\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter account.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the confirmation of an I.V. coronavirus case, the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) issued a state of emergency in I.V. at its March 24 virtual meeting, strongly urging the county to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to take all necessary actions to slow the spread of COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now that we have a case of COVID-19 in Isla Vista, it is time for Isla Vistans to take social distancing seriously. This is a public health crisis that will affect not just our older folks — it will affect student-aged individuals too,” I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said in an interview on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In accordance with federal, state and local mandates ordering social distancing and banning gatherings of more than 10 people, the district also urged Isla Vistans at its meeting to avoid any mass gatherings, including Deltopia — the yearly unsanctioned street party held on the first weekend of spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD postponed its planned </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-12/alternative-deltopia-festival-postponed-indefinitely-due-to-ucsb-coronavirus-precautions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative Deltopia festival</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, after UC Santa Barbara announced its </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">switch to remote instruction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on March 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that if Deltopia takes place, that could be catastrophic for our public health system. Our public resources are almost entirely devoted to fighting this public health crisis right now, at the county, state and all the way to the local level down to us here in Isla Vista,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be very, very inappropriate to use this weekend to break the social distancing order and go out and party.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB, in accordance with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-22/university-sheriffs-office-discourage-deltopia-celebrations-in-light-of-coronavirus-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent an email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to campus organizations on March 12 that discouraged students from participating in Deltopia to help control the spread of the coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><em>[Updated: 3/31/20 1:07 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

That’s not going to happen for us,” said Talia Chalhoub, a biopsychology major who will also be graduating with a certificate in technology management. “The fact that [we] can’t walk into Campbell Hall ever again … You can’t just go sit outside at Cajé anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are people that I’m never going to see again,” she added. “I’m pretending that all this has given us is an extra week at home rather than taking away any time we have remaining.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub, who also has a sister graduating from San Diego State University with the class of 2020, said she hopes to return to I.V. during spring quarter. She pays nearly $1,000 a month to live in I.V., and unlike the thousands of UCSB students who lived on-campus and were given the option to sever their dorm leases, it isn’t as easy to back out for </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vistans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Chalhoub also lives in a house with 13 housemates, which she said can make it difficult to navigate the logistics of online classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know some professors might be recording [lectures] and putting them online, in which case you could just put in your headphones and you’ll be fine anywhere. But other professors are having you log on at 9 a.m. during regular class period,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have a 9 a.m. and [my roommates] have 9 a.m.s and it’s a different class, are we supposed to sit in the same room? How are we supposed to participate if the sound is too loud?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub is one of thousands of UCSB students who are grappling with this unprecedented situation. The university is actively encouraging students to stay away from I.V. if they have already left for their hometowns — warning that the coronavirus can spread quickly in the packed college town — but some seniors are grappling with how to handle their last quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they stay in what has now become a “ghost town,” as put by cultural anthropology major Alex Buckley, or do they return to their hometowns and say goodbye to I.V.?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley, who is immunocompromised and works a full-time job while also taking classes, said she was initially excited when she found out that UCSB was transitioning to remote instruction for spring quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought, okay, this might be a great idea. I’m not going to have to worry about going into class. But then once it actually hit me that I wasn’t going to be able to have an actual, last quarter on campus … it made me really sad,” Buckley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t have any time to say goodbye to anybody. Or even realize that my last day of class, last quarter, was the last class I would ever take on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley said going home would be easier for her than for her peers, because her parents live in Santa Barbara. But her I.V. landlord “already told us that he’s not letting anybody out of their lease.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t have any choice but to stay [in I.V.],” she said. “I would prefer to move and get out of I.V. since there’s nothing here and nothing open anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she considered subletting but hasn’t been able to find anyone actively trying to move into I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people, instead, are trying to get out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walking around, Isla Vista is such a ghost town,” she said. “It’s really weird and super quiet. There’s no cars on the street, everyone I know has left and it’s a super weird, eerie feeling.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For seniors who have already left for their hometowns, such as for English major Jasmine Garcia, their lives are up in the air — it’s unknown if they will be able to return to I.V. and carry out their senior traditions, or how they will handle remote classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garcia, who transferred to UCSB in Fall Quarter 2018, said this next quarter is going to be difficult for her to manage because she won’t have access to in-person campus resources such as Campus Learning Assistance Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I have to] become independent and find my own ways to get my essays revised,” she said. “I’m an English major, and [this] makes me feel like I don’t have any other support at the moment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that it felt like her life “completely froze for a second” when she found out that Spring Quarter 2020 would be conducted remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer, this “leaves me with one and a half years [at UCSB],” Garcia said. “I miss interacting with people and finding new connections … that was the number one thing I actually enjoyed the most [at UCSB].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Garcia, UCSB senior Sierra Hastings has also returned to her hometown. But Hastings finds herself in a unique situation for her last quarter; she’s in the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater program, along with nine other people in her senior class — a program that is “a struggle” to teach online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hastings said that her professor has been checking in with her class but noted that they’re “at the same kind of loss, like, ‘Oh my god, how are we going to teach theater and dance on a computer?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s going to be a different quality than what we would get from being in a classroom.
