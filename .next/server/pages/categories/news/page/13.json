When the graduate students went on a full strike last Monday, they refused to hold sections, grade or hold office hours in addition to continuing to withhold fall quarter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an open letter addressed to all faculty, staff and students, Napolitano said the contract between the university and UAW 2865 contains a “contractual promise” that its teaching assistants (TAs) would not strike while the contract was in effect, through June 30, 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the current contract allows for waived tuition, 3% annual wage increases, childcare subsidies, a one-time signing bonus and a remission of healthcare premiums. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The obligations between the University and its unions are negotiated and memorialized systemwide in collective bargaining agreements, which must be voted on and ratified by the union membership,” Napolitano wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling the wildcat strike “in direct violation of the existing collective bargaining agreement,” Napolitano said the UC would not re-open the union’s current contract nor would it agree to a COLA in addition to the current contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The TAs must honor their side of the bargain, just as the University must honor its commitments. The wildcat strike must come to an end,” Napolitano ended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer sent a separate email on the same day to all UCSC faculty, informing them that graduate students who did not submit grades from Fall Quarter 2019 would be dismissed from TA positions for Spring Quarter 2020. Kletzer wrote that graduate students had until Feb. 21 to “submit all missing grades, to end the strike and to fulfill their contractual obligations,” before facing consequences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those who do not submit full grade information by February 21 will not receive spring quarter appointments or will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments,” Kletzer wrote, calling it a “difficult next step that our campus must take.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her email, Kletzer also emphasized multiple times the “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">costs on students, particularly our undergraduate students,” that the strike was creating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She urged faculty members to “speak with [their] TAs and advisees and encourage them to stop their unsanctioned strike and to submit the missing grades.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer noted that UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive had proposed two new initiatives in an effort to end the strike: creating support packages for up to five years for doctoral students and two years for master’s students, alongside a $2,500 annual need-based housing stipend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous interview with the Nexus, Jane Komori, a doctoral student within the history of consciousness department and co-secretary of the UCSC Graduate Student Association (GSA), called the offers “insufficient,” and said they showed, to her, that the university “doesn’t take our demands seriously at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 15, UCSC’s GSA addressed Napolitano and Ketzler’s letters in an email to graduate students, telling the students not to submit their fall quarter grades before the GSA General Assembly meeting on Feb. 18, where they plan to discuss the termination threats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a decisive moment in our struggle,” the UCSC GSA wrote in the email, noting that this was the first communication the graduate students have received from Napolitano regarding the strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the email, over 200 graduate students had received warning letters from the university for failing to submit Fall Quarter 2019 grades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If hundreds of graduate student workers are terminated from employment, whole departments will be unable to offer courses next quarter, dozens of international graduate students will effectively face deportation, UCSC rankings will nosedive, huge sources of funding will be jeopardized, political organizing at other campuses will intensify, and UCSC may become subject to academic boycott (over 1,000 non-UCSC scholars and educators have already committed to a pledge of </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG2HqiSsC2XFFaT26e0YfGkRNo0LbIxQAiCxHoG12IlErlSw/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solidarity and non-cooperation with UCSC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">),” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In short, such a move would profoundly impoverish graduate and undergraduate education and research at UCSC, as well as its collaborations and partnerships with other research institutions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email also noted that a poll taken in mid-January found that 715 graduate students were in favor of withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our readiness to escalate is profoundly unsettling for UC leadership,” the email continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Union leadership at UCSB addressed Napolitano’s letter on Feb. 18 in an email to the UC Office of the President (UCOP), UCSC leadership and the COLA email groups at UCSC and UCSB. Sheila Kulkarni, the recording secretary of the UAW 2865 bargaining unit at UCSB, said in the email that termination of existing employment for spring quarter is a violation of </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/know-your-rights/contract/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Article 3 (Appointment Security), Section D</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the agreement, an Academic Student Employee (ASE) can only be removed from a position when the student has become “academically ineligible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The University has no standing to terminate ASEs who have been promised employment in spring quarter,” Kulkarni wrote in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To be clear, if you are a TA who has been promised an appointment for spring quarter in any way, formally or informally, verbally or in writing, this statement from President Napolitano is in clear violation of your union rights… We are more than happy to help file grievances on behalf of our colleagues at UC Santa Cruz.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC COLA movement is calling on graduate students at other schools to begin striking as well, UCSB graduate students discussed in their most recent COLA meeting on Thursday.

Over the past several years, A.S. senators have introduced various resolutions calling for A.S. and UCSB, among other UC entities, to withdraw investments from companies that profit off of alleged human rights violations by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last spring was the sixth time in seven years that a version of the resolution was introduced to the A.S. Senate. The resolution failed last year, making UCSB the only undergraduate campus in the UC system that has not passed a divestment resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Tyler Barth, who is responsible for </span><a href=\"https://coc.as.ucsb.edu/position/office-of-the-attorney-general-attorney-general/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investigating and prosecuting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “any potential violations of ASUCSB Legal Code,” said in an email that conflicts of interest are defined in A.S. Legal Code as “situations of personal financial gain (A1), situations wherein votes are cast to benefit friends and family (A2), and situations where the interests of AS senators’ outside organizational involvements conflict with the interests of ASUCSB (A3).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said in a follow-up interview that while the Perspectives trips were mostly covered by the Santa Barbara Hillel, they did not count, in his interpretation of Legal Code, as a “financial gain,” since attendees did not actually receive any financial compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barth, in addition to a number of current and former elected members of A.S., went on the Perspectives trip this past summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I decided to go on this educational trip, I was seeking to enhance my knowledge of international issues through first-hand experience. If I thought it was a conflict of interest and would inhibit my ability to judge fairly and impartially as Attorney General the following year, I would not have gone,” Barth said in a message when asked if he believed his own attendance on the trip created a conflict of interest in determining if attending the trip created a conflict of interest for senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I maintain that, using the definition of conflict of interest in AS Legal Code that governs my position, Perspectives is not a conflict of interest for elected officials who have gone or intend to go on it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also argues that the application for the trip “implicitly states” that the trip will be unbiased but does not actually provide students with “a diversity of perspectives” because the trip is funded by Maccabee Task Force (MTF); MTF advertises itself on its website as an organization created “to combat the disturbing spread of anti-Semitism on America’s college campuses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the BDS movement is at the forefront of this troubling trend. We maintain that BDS is an anti-Semitic movement that crosses the line from legitimate criticism of Israel into the dangerous demonization of Israel and its supporters,” MTF continues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is “a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movement’s website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and “aims to end international support for Israeli violations of international law by forcing companies, institutions and governments to change their policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition argues that MTF’s stance “demonstrate[s] [MTF’s] closed mindedness regarding the occupation, given its obvious and vehement opposition to the Palestinian call for</span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against Israel (BDS).” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP also condemns the fact that Sheldon Adelson — one of the </span><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/trump-inc-podcast/sheldon-adelson-casino-magnate-trump-macau-and-japan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">biggest funders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and a “</span><a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/2018/10/22/sheldon-adelson-breaks-spending-record-on-midterm-elections-surpassing-100m/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conservative megadonor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” — serves as president of MTF. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Furthermore, the reign of terror that Donald Trump and Republican Congresspeople have exacted on marginalized communities within the United States and across the globe, combined with the continued occupation of Palestine galvanized by far-right political figures in Israel, has been extensively funded by Adelson much like MTF’s Perspectives Trips,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also notes that the Santa Barbara Hillel received $238,739 from MTF in 2016 for “Campus Education and Trip to Israel” — the largest donation to a college campus listed on the </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201702979349300200/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maccabee Task Force’s 2016 tax returns</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — and an additional $119,807 in </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201842699349301204/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There was no donation purpose listed on the 2017 returns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This demonstrates the immense commitment from outside billionaires to engage in “pro-Israel” lobbying on students, specifically at the UCSB campus,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman, the executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the organization receives funding from people with a wide variety of political views, but that a funder’s political leanings do not affect the kind of programming the center puts on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It happens, that in this case, we have a funder who we’re transparent about. If students ask, we will tell them where the particular funding from portions of this comes from,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our organization has a budget that is close to a million dollars; there’s no student who would be happy with the politics of every single one of those donors,” he added. “We have conservative students as well, who might not be happy with some of our progressive donors’ political leanings. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t use those funds to help put on Shabbat dinners on Friday night.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman also said he is personally responsible for putting together the itinerary for the Perspectives trip. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That doesn’t mean that my own personal politics need to align with a lead donor on this project to make it a successful project,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Goodman said Hillel does not claim that the trip will be unbiased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I make it very clear, it’s not unbiased. We’re gonna show them lots of biases, we’re gonna show them a wide variety of different perspectives, and they’re not gonna agree with all of them,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea that college students would come to college in order to advocate boycotts, and then advocate boycotts of things that could help you to learn more about the situation at hand or meet other people is patently absurd,” Goodman added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to opposing the trip due to its funding sources, SJP wrote in the petition that they are calling for a boycott of the trip because they believed the trip contributes to the “normalization of the occupation of Palestine, and its ultimate goal of silencing calls for Palestinian freedom.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP representatives Dylan Kupsh and Ivana Cruz said in an interview that they felt the need to circulate this petition because they believed “outside lobbyists” should not be influencing campus politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope people understand the real gravity at stake at UCSB and how much people are lobbying,” Kupsh said. “I would be outraged as a student to know that an outside person is influencing student politics more than students themselves or student orgs.”  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The emails came from various websites such as LinkedIn, Tinder and Christian Mingle, all of which were meant for a person under the pseudonym of Joseph Hawk.

Students on both sides of the argument were present for the meeting’s public comment, with the majority in support of Palestine.

The protestors formed a large circle, sang, played instruments and gave a series of speeches in opposition to the housing project — while also providing a list of alternative spaces for the project that they believe would better suit the needs of the community. If built, the People’s Park development would provide 1,200 beds for undergraduate students and 75 to 125 permanent living spaces for houseless individuals.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new routers should meet demand for data transmission on campus for the next five to seven years. <em>Channing Mink / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $2.7 million upgrade from 10 to 100 gigabit links is set to be completed in April, but buildings such as the University Library could see immediate improvements in data transmission speed, according to Kevin Schmidt, UCSB’s director of Enterprise Technology Services, who is in charge of the router replacement project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Schmidt said that there will not be a very noticeable immediate impact on internet speeds in most other parts of campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the previous router installation was in 2010, the rapid progression of technology in the past decade has increased demand for larger data usage, according to Schmidt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The center part of our network … is operating at speeds that were fine for its day, but the aggregate demand that we have is large enough that in order to support the future of this campus’ teaching research and community service mission, we must upgrade this,” Schmidt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new routers should meet demand for data transmission on campus for the next five to seven years, according to Schmidt, at which point they will have to be upgraded again.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $2.7 million used for the project includes the cost of the routers, labor for installation and maintenance for over the next seven years. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB data network will be down during the router installation from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. on the following Wednesdays: Feb. 26, March 4, April 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By increasing the capacity of the data network, Schmidt said the data transmission speed at individual buildings can then be improved. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If data speeds in specific buildings were increased without building more data capacity, it would be like making “really big roads that lead right into a two-lane highway,” Schmidt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want to do first is make the highway bigger, and then we’ll make the streets out to the residential neighborhoods larger,” Schmidt added, referring to various other buildings on campus as the “residential neighborhoods.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the time span for replacing the new routers is listed as three hours, the actual installations could be as short at 15 minutes, decreasing the amount of time the network is down, according to Schmidt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An upgraded network could also facilitate easier use of multimedia teaching materials, such as video, according to Rich Wolski, a professor in the computer science department at UCSB. Video uses such a large amount of data relative to other internet uses that the campus will “overwhelmingly” notice the upgrade in the form of faster video loading speeds, he added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you were to go to another research school, you would expect 10 gigabit networking to be present, you might not expect 100 [gigabits],” Wolski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond internet usage, data transmissions on campus can typically be from researchers downloading information from NASA satellites, according to Schmidt. Information downloaded can include weather patterns and ocean temperatures over periods of time.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step in the project is to evaluate the data connections between the central network and the service in individual buildings, according to Schmidt. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We fixed the highway that brings us into the city, and then we need to look at those roads that lead off the highway into the neighborhoods,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92754\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92754\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/","id":3390,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[3389,3388,3387],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Soc 152A Professors Reminisce Over More than Four Decades of Teaching Sex-Ed","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/baldwins.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/baldwins.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Janice and John Baldwin have been teaching the current iteration of Soc 152A for over 40 years.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soc 152A: Sociology of Human Sexuality needs no introduction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A class which has existed in its current iteration for more than four decades, it is taught by the Baldwins, a pair of professors who are, at this point, a fixture of UC Santa Barbara’s campus culture.

They drew feedback from students in order to figure out what undergraduates wanted to prioritize in the broad subject of human sexuality, whether it be sociology, relationships, sexually transmitted diseases or the physiology and anatomy of the human sexual response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Initially, we had some dead ends as we stumbled around, trying to figure out what to do. Eventually we came up with a questionnaire where [in] the last lecture every quarter, we would ask, ‘What would you like us to expand? What would you like to shrink down?’ Eventually everything started to stabilize out,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout this process, Soc 152A evolved to more heavily emphasize the subject of sexual health and the sociology of healthy relationships, while putting less time into anthropology and general biology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] aren’t that interested in sexual variations across different cultures,” Janice explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally thought the stuff was fascinating. We read so many studies in anthropology, and thought, ‘Oh my God! They do it so differently!’ I mean, every culture is filled with amazing examples of how different people treat sex and gender across the planet. We just got excited — but the students weren’t that interested,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time in the early ‘70s, Soc 152A also grew into a much larger class, from 100 students to 150, before the Baldwins moved to Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall, teaching 300 students. Then finally, they made the leap to Campbell Hall — with its capability to shine enormous projections of the labia, the vas deferens, ejaculation and the female orgasm — all while lecturing to 600 to 650 students at once.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the decades of teaching the course, some subjects would vary from year to year, finding time in the limelight before dropping completely off the radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are fads, you know. There was a fad of changing the minor lips [of the labia], going through surgery to get them cosmetically changed. Now the big thing is they get implants in your butt. That’s bigger than breast implants,” Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Baldwins’ perspective, having two people onstage in Campbell Hall improves students’ understanding of concepts taught while also preventing students from misinterpreting what any one person says. After all, sexuality is a topic which can spur strong reactions and brings with it some baggage, Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many people in the room that are sensitive to this. And I think if John said some of the things he says, and I wasn’t there, people could take it incorrectly,” Janice said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Soc 152A] does cover some delicate topics.

id=\"caption-attachment-92762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SBCC students have been housed in Tropicana for over 20 years. <em>Andrea Verdugo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tropicana Gardens, the counterpart to Tropicana Del Norte, will now solely house UC Santa Barbara students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift in housing is motivated by the different schedules of the two schools, said Dave Wilcox, executive director of Tropicana Student Living, which manages the two properties. Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) runs on a semester system, starting in August and ending in May, while UCSB works on a quarter system, starting in late September and ending in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After evaluating our numbers over the past couple of years, [Tropicana Student Living] decided that it was best for all parties to make a change to better support both sets of students,” Wilcox said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, with all the students [in one dorm] attending the same school, everyone can start and end at the same time,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilcox emphasized that there will be no change in the number of SBCC students and UCSB students living in Tropicana Student Living overall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We aren’t adding anything or taking anything away,” Wilcox said. “Overall, we expect our SBCC student numbers and UCSB student numbers to stay roughly the same, with 300 SBCC and 600 UCSB students.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBCC students have been housed in Tropicana for over 20 years, Wilcox explained. The city college doesn’t have any residence halls near its campus, which is located in downtown Santa Barbara, so Tropicana has housed SBCC students who want a residence hall experience, Wilcox said. To get to school, SBCC students can take the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District line 15X from Tropicana Del Norte, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the housing change, Wilcox said that incoming UCSB and SBCC students will receive the exact same residence hall experience as students have had in the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now we can provide more direct services that are 100% geared towards their specific school,” Wilcox said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tropicana Student Living talked with both SBCC and UCSB administration to inform them of the decision and to see if there could be any negative impacts, but “everyone we spoke with all saw the benefits of making this shift,” Wilcox said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tropicana Del Norte is currently being advertised to SBCC students on the university’s website under the housing section, according to Wilcox. As opposed to living in a house or apartment in Isla Vista, downtown Santa Barbara or the general Santa Barbara area, Wilcox said, “if SBCC students want to have a residence hall experience, Tropicana is the only option available to them.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

On Dec. 9, hundreds of graduate students went on a wildcat strike, meaning the strike is not authorized by their union. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduate students, as part of their strike, refused to release over 12,000 undergraduate grades by the submission deadline of Dec. 18 until the university agreed to a COLA of $1,412 a month to supplement their current TA salaries. The university refused, and this past Monday, UCSC graduate students began an indefinite full wildcat strike, meaning a strike without the authorization of their union, UC Student-Workers Union (UAW Local 2865). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the root of the UC COLA movements is the concept of rent burden, defined as spending more than 30% of one’s wages on rent, according to the UCSC COLA website. Students’ rent burdens vary from campus to campus, but across the UC, organizers have been using rent burden to calculate COLAs specific to their respective universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While only the UCSC COLA movement has officially gone on strike, several other UCs, such as UCSB and UCSD, have now drafted and presented demands to leadership at their respective universities. At other UCs, such as UC Los Angeles, UC Berkeley and UC Davis, COLA movements are in their infancy, but are growing fast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus spoke with organizers at various UC campuses to document their COLA movements and the stages each movement is in. </span></p>\n<p>Further coverage of UCSB’s COLA movement can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>UC Santa Cruz:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students finished their third day on strike on Wednesday; throughout the day, hundreds of graduate students linked arms and blocked the intersection at the base of UCSC’s campus, facing off against a blockade of police officers and disrupting bus services. At least 16 people were arrested and given citations, City on a Hill Press reported, but as of 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, only one remained in custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a press release sent out by the UCSC COLA movement, at</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> least one student allegedly “had her finger broken by police, another was bleeding profusely from his head after being hit by batons, and others received bruised ribs and bones.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jane Komori, a doctoral student within the history of consciousness department and co-secretary of the UCSC Graduate Student Association, explained that at UCSC, the demand for a COLA officially began in November, when graduate students presented their demands to the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Santa Cruz students pay 50, 60, 70% of their wages of rent per month, which makes it next to impossible to afford most other things, especially if you have medical copays or childcare or any kind of emergency,” Komori said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, UCSC graduate students are on an indefinite strike; those who are a part of the COLA movement are not holding office hours and sections and will not release undergraduate students’ fall quarter and upcoming winter quarter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said that last week, UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive offered new programs for graduate students that would help offset the cost of living, such as one that offers five years of funding at their current pay rate, and another than would provide a $2,500 a year housing supplement or fellowship for those in need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Komori called the offers “insufficient,” and said that showed, to her, that the university “doesn’t take our demands seriously at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the last she heard, administration would be starting “disciplinary action against the strike.” Several graduate students posted to social media about receiving disciplinary hearing summons and formal warning letters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Monday, upwards of 1,500 UCSC undergraduate students have also signed a petition in support of their graduate students, Komori said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said the university is now refusing to meet with the striking graduate students now that they are “carrying out an unsanctioned strike.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been updating through the Twitter account </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@payusmoreucsc and on the website payusmoreucsc.com. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon said the strike at UCSC is “illegal” and that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC San Diego: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC San Diego’s COLA movement began last year, when the university’s Housing, Dining and Hospitality Unit — the equivalent of UCSB’s Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises — planned to increase graduate students’ rents for on-campus apartments, according to Celine Khoury, a doctoral student in literature and recording secretary within the San Diego chapter of United Automobile Workers (UAW) Local 2865, the UC-wide union representing graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students held a housing march to protest the plan, but the unit raised the price of rent regardless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was out of this momentum that the UCSD COLA movement formed, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our [graduate students] make up 15% of our workforce,” Khoury said. “UCSD has the largest number of academic employees out of all of the UCs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a UCSD COLA fact sheet posted to the movement’s Twitter account, graduate teaching assistants made $2,434 a month, and a majority of them paid over 42% of their monthly wages in rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Khoury described the UCSD COLA moment as very “grassroots” and “collaborative,” explaining that there are a number of members of the UCSD COLA movement that are also involved with the UCSD Graduate Student Association (GSA) and the campus union, UAW 2865. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this week, the UCSD GSA unanimously passed a resolution that supported both the striking UCSC workers as well as any future action taken by graduate students at UC San Diego, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, approximately 80 members of the UCSD COLA movement, alongside a few campus groups and undergraduates, held a “peaceful march” across campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group made its way to UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla’s office, where they planned on delivering their demands, which include providing all student workers with housing stipends that translate to between $1,400 and $3,100 a month; lowering rent on all existing on-campus housing; and building affordable on-campus housing for the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Khosla didn’t open the door, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, organizers “chanted the letter” and, before they left, “taped all of our signs to the chancellor’s door and the [outside] walls of his office.” Now, they are waiting for the chancellor to respond to their demands. The UCSD COLA movement also held a public forum Wednesday night, open to all students and faculty, to provide updates on the UC-wide COLA rallies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ColaUcsd. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Rich, a doctoral student in English at UC Davis, said the UCD COLA movement began in December, in solidarity with the UCSC COLA movement. Several other UC COLA movements also held rallies in solidarity with UCSC on the same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our initial purpose was to just try and support them, but we pretty quickly, like a lot of other campuses, were realizing that we have a lot of similar problems that Santa Cruz is having … so we used that first event as a jumping off point.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rich said the movement is currently composed of a smaller group of graduate students rather than an entire organization. They plan to attend their UCD GSA meeting and talk to the local union members about how to broaden the movement, Rich said, and they’re also starting to reach out to undergraduates as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Rich is hoping they can draft a list of demands that also would help with equity between departments or guaranteed summer funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few members of the UCD COLA movement also travelled to UC Santa Cruz to support the strikers; according to the @ucd4cola Twitter account, one of the UCD COLA organizers was among those arrested during the Wednesday UCSC COLA strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ucd4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Berkeley: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tara Phillips, UAW 2865 and UC Berkeley COLA organizer, said the COLA movement at UC Berkeley is “still in its infancy,” noting that it was difficult to get a COLA movement off the ground because the campus union wasn’t supportive of the movement “until recently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement’s first action was in December, she said, when around 70 people held a solidarity rally for UCSC strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] talked about how difficult it is to get by here, how precarious the lives of grad students are because pay is so low and rent is so high,” Phillips said. “Folks were talking about landlord abuse and the inability to pay for medical treatment, loans that folks need to take out just to supplement their income … [but] also how much we love teaching, and that we wish the university valued it more.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phillips said that while most graduate students pay 50% or more of their wages on rent, that payment only lasts for 10 months of the year — nine months for the UC campuses on the quarter system — and most students “have to scramble over the summer to get rent money together, because teaching is not guaranteed in the summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re living very stressful, financially precarious lives for a long time,” she said, adding that she believes the university has done a “very poor job” in terms of equity across the various UC Berkeley departments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly – the equivalent of UCSB’s GSA – and UAW 2863 passed a resolution in support of the UCSC strike last week, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Phillips said the movement is “just starting to map out what the future looks like for us, and how to keep building that movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re sort of in this educational phase … but ideally we’d like to be able to turn out a lot of graduate students to a general assembly, and discuss collectively what we want, what our demands look like, and how to pressure the administration to give us a COLA.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that UAW 2865 came up with a projected COLA for UC Berkeley to bring students out of rent burden — $2,103, the highest number so far across the UCs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting on the Facebook page “Cal COLA: Pay Us More UCB.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Los Angeles: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA GSA President Zak Fisher, who attends UCLA School of Law, explained that after UCSC students went on strike, the conversation of a UCLA COLA became a “hot topic of conversation.” He noted, however, that there is “no official club” for a UCLA COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen this campus today engaging this important question of, ‘How do we fight for a cost-of-living adjustment or for cost-of-living issues more generally?’ I haven’t met a graduate student yet who said, ‘No way, we get paid enough, what are you doing?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher said that he ran for GSA president on a platform of creating a cost-of-living adjustment for graduate students, among other issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, graduate students are spreading a survey around in hopes of getting a better idea of how rent-burdened students are, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As GSA president, Fisher said he has spoken to administrators about the issues that he ran on, but “they’ll give you lip service all day, saying ‘Hey, these are important issues,’ but then you’ll meet with them three months later and say, ‘Oh, what have you done? Absolutely nothing.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that he’s seen support from UCLA undergraduate students as well, noting that the undergraduate student government and the GSA unanimously passed a resolution in support for UCSC strikers, demanding that there be no retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone is starting to realize, this is our collective fight and our collective struggle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting under the Twitter handle @ucla4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Riverside: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB COLA Outreach Committee member Adam Parison confirmed that a “pretty small” COLA movement was beginning at UC Riverside, but that the movement has no social media platforms yet, and Parison could not provide contact information for any COLA organizers at UCR.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

territorial. I didn’t feel seen there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said he wanted to find a way for all students to have access to the outdoors regardless of economic, social and structural barriers, so he created Making Adventure Possible for All Students, known around campus as MAPAS. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MAPAS, established in November 2017, is a club dedicated to diversifying the outdoors and fostering stewardship for the environment, Gonzalez said. He founded the organization with the intention of creating a welcoming community and increasing opportunities for marginalized groups to experience outdoor adventures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdoor activities tend to be homogenous and exclude underrepresented groups, Gonzalez said. Outdoor gear is expensive and purchasing the equipment required to participate in adventures is not feasible for some students, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said he does not believe that the outdoor community intentionally excludes marginalized groups, but that there are structural factors that can limit access to these spaces, and it is important to recognize and address those factors.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People’s parents have to work, they don’t have access to the outdoors, maybe they live in cities,” Gonzalez pointed out. He also noted the lack of public transit to natural spaces, such as national parks, as a further limitation on who is able to visit those spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he acknowledged groups who aim to make adventuring more affordable for students, like UCSB Adventure Programs and Excursion Club, Gonzalez said MAPAS was created to address a deeper problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has really robust opportunities for adventure,” MAPAS Outdoors Chair and fifth-year psychology major Phoebe Rogers said. “At first glance, it’s easy to see the barrier just being a paywall, but it’s more than that for us. MAPAS is trying to carve a space where people of color and people from diverse backgrounds feel like the space was made for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea for an all-inclusive outdoor community club first came to Gonzalez from a surfing trip. While out on the water one morning, Gonzalez said an exchange student from Mexico paddled up to him and they immediately connected with one another through sharing tips and stories about surfing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He looked like me,” Gonzalez said. “I remember thinking, ‘Is this how everyone else feels? Is this how it always feels to have a community out here?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To hold onto that feeling and to encourage more diversity in the surfing community, Gonzalez had the idea to create a Latinx surfing team. But after a while, he decided he wanted the club to include all outdoor activities, not just surfing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to breaking the opportunity gap and diversifying the outdoors, Gonzalez said he wanted to bring people into the outdoors to foster greater environmental stewardship, further the conversation of environmental justice and raise awareness of the inequitable environmental burdens people of color and low-income communities experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I care about environmental issues. I’m in love with the outdoors; why wouldn’t I want to take care of it?” Gonzalez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After recruiting others who were passionate about this issue, Gonzalez said MAPAS secured funding from faculty and community members through a </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/mapas-20192020-fund?fbclid=IwAR3c5AlAFNXvwvO8n7IwuDGtpf9b3vsmwa5N073AtJ1BrWQ8q0V2mg0_nqY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GoFundMe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and applied for grants through the UCSB Healthy Campus Network. MAPAS uses these funds to purchase and rent outdoor gear, purchase food, campsites and permits, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, MAPAS has organized several hikes, kayaking trips, climbing events and volunteer restoration projects as well as a backpacking trip to Big Sur. MAPAS also hosts potlucks for its members to foster a sense of community and create opportunities for connection, which Rogers said is the ultimate goal of the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear to see what kind of community we are building, and how different that feels compared to other spaces on campus,” Rogers said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of our events feel really familial, and it’s different when you have an intention and a purpose coming together. There’s more of an energy to it,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Rogers said MAPAS has plans to continue with its “Demystifying Backpacking” workshop series to share information about backpacking. In the workshop, more experienced MAPAS members get together with first-time backpackers to break down and explain everything one needs to know about backpacking, from what gear to bring to how to purify water to what to do about going to the bathroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MAPAS also has plans to include professors in its trips to break down the “student-faculty ivory tower barrier,” Rogers said. By going on a hike with a professor, Gonzalez hopes that students can make connections with faculty outside of the classroom and learn about different research and academic opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez hopes MAPAS will be an inspiration for other UCs to create their own version of the club and eventually have a widespread community that encourages diversity in the outdoors across different campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MAPAS aims to address the lack of diversity in outdoor spaces and bring more people into the conversation,” Gonzalez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our intention is to be a launchpad,” Rogers said. “Our goal is for our members to build the skills so that they feel comfortable putting themselves into outdoor spaces and breaking down the barriers together so that those spaces don’t feel so intimidating and closed off.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, the contract allowed HOPR to cancel at any time, as long as it gives the university 60-day notice, according to Chelsea Davidoff, a HOPR representative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main challenge was economic, ridership revenue is not enough to pay the bills. This is true for most transit modes,” Davidoff said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although HOPR’s ridership was not considered a problem, revenue from riders was not sufficient enough to cover operating costs, according to James Wagner, program manager for the Transportation Alternatives Program (T.A.P.) at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most bicycle-share programs on college campuses need subsidies to survive and keep their rates affordable to customers, due to the expensive cost of buying and maintaining shared bicycles, Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The HOPR contract contemplated securing a sponsor but since they didn’t get one, the program was not economically feasible. As such they requested to cancel the contract,” Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB T.A.P. plans to replace HOPR’s service with another bicycle rental company, </span><a href=\"https://www.bcycle.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BCycle</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the future, Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transportation &amp; Parking Services currently does not have room in its budget to front the cost for a bicycle-share program, Wagner said. HOPR did not initially ask for a subsidy because it expected to secure a sponsor, which is why it was contracted, Davidoff added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“HOPR provided an option to the University to sponsor or subsidize the program as part of the transportation budget, but this budget was not available,” Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We may open another request for proposals (RFP) to see if other bicycle share vendors are willing to provide bicycle share at no cost to the university besides user fees,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recognized as a Platinum-level Bicycle Friendly University by the League of American Bicyclists</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Part of this recognition is due to the large number of bicycles available to share on campus through HOPR, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOPR remains in other cities and universities throughout the country where it has found more economic success, such as UC Los Angeles, the University of South Florida and the cities of Santa Monica, Atlanta and Orlando, according to Davidoff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidoff said that despite the early contract termination, HOPR leaves UCSB thankful for the opportunity from the university and support from students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope they find a budget for bike share, students love it, it is affordable, healthy, fun and environmentally friendly. If there is a will, there’s always a way,” Davidoff said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div

social media, students expressed frustration at the termination of the long-standing tool. But the data it used to function has since become outdated, explained Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for information technology and chief information officer at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that most of the map’s original operators have also since left the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the age of the infrastructure and some complex configuration issues, staff members with skills sets that we previously had, who understood the nuances of the configuration, are no longer here at UCSB,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s grown to a point where we need to staff and license it appropriately.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The map began as a joint academic project between the geography department and other data providers on campus to locate lecture halls, classrooms, food establishments and hydration stations as well as parking structures and meters, according to Hall. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the map was opened to the UCSB community in February 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, early stages of its development began in 2008 under the leadership of Dylan Parenti, the information technology manager of the geography department at the time. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a Nexus article published in 2013,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the map relies on multiple layers of software which combine to make the map a multifaceted geographical tool.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the map featured interactive tools, including self-guided tours through natural spaces like the Campus Lagoon and lists of the energy consumptions of various buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Estrada, university spokesperson, said that discussions are now ongoing about “the best way to create and maintain tools and resources for navigating the university and real time and helping to ensure the best campus experience for students, faculty, staff and visitors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hall and his team await the approval and funding they need to relaunch the map, they are working to improve certain elements of it, such as its access to the Environmental Systems Research Institute and Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System, information databases that provide geographic data, Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the funding comes through, “we’ll be right back at it,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Feb. 18, 2020]: This article was

Graduate students have been organizing the demands since Jan. 21, when students held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“sick-out”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of UCSC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily, a first-year sociology graduate student who declined to give her last name, spoke to the crowd at the University Library on Monday about how the list of demands was created, noting that it was important that as many graduate student voices as possible were included. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We read all the comments on the 994 surveys we got, we took it into consideration, we wrote these and this is what we came up with,” Emily told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All campuses across UC are organizing in some way for this COLA, and that’s how we’re going to get strength and prove to the administration that something’s got to change if we stand together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lex Taylor, a third-year political science and economics major, also spoke to the crowd in front of the library, representing a handful of undergraduate students who marched in solidarity with graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are mostly taught by grad students. These are the people making sure this university is working … that we are going into our classes getting the education we deserve,” Taylor said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taylor also referenced the three-year long </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strike efforts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union as a sign that COLA efforts can be successful too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME, for the last three years, striked on and off, and they won. Right now at Santa Cruz, grad students are starting to strike, we are about to give our demands all across the UCs and grad students are showing what they can do,” Taylor added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Emily read the demands aloud and several graduate students spoke regarding the need for COLA, the group marched from the University Library to the fifth floor of Cheadle Hall, where students presented the list of demands to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond asking for a COLA, the students’ demands included several stipulations: that the COLA amount will be recalculated annually to account for increases in housing costs, that a COLA will not come from an increase in graduate or undergraduate tuition, that the university will not retaliate in any form against those supporting or participating in the demand for a COLA and that the university will accommodate the higher financial needs of graduate students with children or dependent adults.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand letter also highlighted the COLA’s necessity and explained that the amount comes from calculating average graduate student income and housing costs in the local area, to determine what amount is necessary per month to keep graduate students from rent burden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter explained that the baseline for a rent burden is 31%, meaning that 31% or more of an individual’s income goes towards housing. However, the average rent burden for graduate students at UCSB is 51%, as calculated by UAW 2865.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stipend necessary to alleviate rent burden at UCSB is the fourth-highest stipend estimate in the UC system, behind Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Los Angeles, according to the UAW report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students earn their income from a variety of different funding sources, such as fellowships, grants, teaching assistant positions and research. Because sources of income vary from student to student and may change on a quarterly basis, UCSB graduate students emphasized in the demands letter that they are asking for a cost-of-living adjustment that is dispersed each month through the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All UCSB graduate students, “regardless of their graduate program, department, year in program, residence, visa category, documentation, funding source, and employment status,” will receive the same COLA amount, according to demands.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon stated that the strike at UCSC is “illegal,” adding that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon explained that the university reached a four-year contract with UAW in August 2018 and that the contract is in place through June 2020. He said that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while the University does not plan to reopen the signed and ratified contract with UAW, we did recently hold a meeting to discuss legitimate student concerns regarding housing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC appreciates the information provided by the UAW and the ongoing dialogue regarding affordable housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the demands have been released to the university, UCSB graduate students will move forward with increasing awareness around the push for a COLA and negotiating with the university, with no plans in the works for a strike, according to multiple graduate students at previous COLA meetings.</span></p>\n<p>Additional photos and coverage of the strike can be viewed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1226971585468358657\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/in-photos-ucsb-graduate-students-present-cola-demands-amidst-uc-wide-rallies/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The initiative was first spearheaded by Decriminalize Santa Cruz, founded by UCSC students. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/this-week-in-uc-news-1-29-2-6/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/this-week-in-uc-news-1-29-2-6/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/this-week-in-uc-news-1-29-2-6/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/this-week-in-uc-news-1-29-2-6/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/this-week-in-uc-news-1-29-2-6/","id":3471,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3470,3469,3468],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Joint Effort: Cannabis Club Hopes To Build a Community, Educate Students","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cannaclub-copy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cannaclub-copy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Cannaclub covers a broad spectrum of the cannabis world and opens the door for students interested in an industry that is oftentimes tricky to access while in college. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s green, expensive and grows plentiful on Santa Barbara farms.

There, he helped to facilitate the Central Coast’s first-ever cannabis community and grew a passion for connecting with growers, testifying in court for cannabis regulations and fostering the local cannabis community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Spring Quarter 2019, he was approached by the president of UC Los Angeles’ (UCLA) Cannaclub, who reached out to encourage him to start his own chapter at UC Santa Barbara.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The president] said, ‘Zain, you go to UCSB, why don’t you empower the student voice, why don’t you give the students a voice in the [cannabis] community?’” Qureshi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t know whether there’s going to be a big interest in [the club]. I didn’t know because I was working with professionals in the field for so long. Students were kind of out of the picture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi created the club that same quarter, which he said was a straightforward process because UCLA’s Cannaclub had already given him all the tools necessary to replicate it at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi’s next step after forming the club was to register it through the Office of Student Life, which he said wasn’t a problem because “[we] weren’t promoting sales, consumption or distribution. It was purely educational.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After registering the club, Qureshi said he pooled some friends together to form Cannaclub’s first executive board. Combined with his past experience in the cannabis industry, he said getting the club off its feet “wasn’t really a problem.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We threw our first event on cannabis and mental health last spring. That was an incredibly informative, hard-opening panel,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a really good turnout too, which was awesome because I couldn’t gauge the interest of the school, but when so many people showed up, I was like, ‘Hey, this is real, you know, like people are actually interested in it,’” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But come Fall Quarter 2019, Cannaclub went dormant when Qureshi left for the quarter to study abroad. After returning for winter quarter, he said he focused his efforts on bringing the club back to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, he said he has a stronger executive team and more people “who are focused on being interested in joining the cannabis industry after college,” which enables the club to work toward one of its central pillars: community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi said he also hopes to inform students about the cannabis industry, create awareness and destigmatize the use of cannabis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the [club’s] pillars is to give people the right tools. Another pillar was to create a more informed, healthier and more conscious community. Statistically speaking, Gauchos are some of the biggest stoners,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took that and I was like, ‘Okay, do people really know what they’re smoking? Do they even know what they’re buying?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locally based cannabis companies — such as Hemp Blank, Green Rush Alliance and Delta Leaf Laboratories — have helped Cannaclub expand by providing the club with resources, speakers and apparel</span>, all of which have contributed to the club’s main goals of education, awareness and entrepreneurship, Qureshi said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Qureshi envisions Cannaclub as a space where members can attend biweekly meetings and mingle with professionals within the cannabis industry while receiving educational sessions and tours throughout Santa Barbara’s cannabis scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, he has been focused on two things — creating different committees within the club and advertising through social media for upcoming events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of January, Cannaclub held an event called “Cannabis and Science,” where a handful of speakers gave talks to students in I.V. Theater about the dangers of vaping, cannabis technological innovations and plant genetics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later this month, Qureshi hopes to host another event, this time for networking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My vision is to throw something at the end of this month that focuses on networking for students at UCSB and students at SBCC,” Qureshi said. “[It will be at] at a venue downtown where we’ll bring out a lot of companies from the cannabis space, from sustainability to delivery to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he’ll soon be leaving UCSB for a career in the cannabis industry, Qureshi hopes that Cannaclub is here to stay. Although the club’s presence on campus is still relatively small, Qureshi is confident that Cannalub will continue to grow over time — as long as the club doesn’t sway from its goal of bringing students together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m trying to build a community, that’s all it is. I want people of all different majors. It doesn’t matter who you are or whatever you’re interested in,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a place for you.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3</em><em> of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
