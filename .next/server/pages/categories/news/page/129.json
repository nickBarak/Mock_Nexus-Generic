administrators announced Wednesday that UCSB has been named a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) due to the campus’ 25 percent Latino student population.</p>\n<p>Due to the recent recognition, the university will now compete for more funding for support services, faculty development and scientific equipment from the Department of Education. Total enrollment for the Latino student population count includes both full- and part-time undergraduate and graduate students currently at the university.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics major Irlanda Martinez said it’s more common for community colleges and state schools to become HSI’s due to public schools’ tendency to be affordable.</p>\n<p>“Given the socio-economic factors most Latinas and Latinos face in the United States, a significant part of our community follows the community college route like me or attends a Cal State due to the more affordable prices of education there,” Martinez said. “Because of this, it is common for community colleges and Cal States to become HSI’s.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the university’s population has been rising, this year surpassing the 25 percent minimum to qualify for the HSI title.</p>\n<p>“Just this year, the Latina/o attendance at UCSB rose to approximately 27 percent, which automatically defined it as an HSI,” Martinez said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, this “automatic definition” is only for HACU and any additional funding would have to come from the Department of Education based on the percentage of students who receive financial assistance and an Educational and General Expenditures Requirement based on per capita expenditures.</p>\n<p>“Both of these requirements were not met by UCSB because we have students who are very well-off, and the averages are thrown off,” Martinez said in an email. “UCSB is in the process of waiving those requirements, which is likely to happen because it is somewhat rare for an institution at the level of UCSB to become defined as an HSI through the Department of Education.”</p>\n<p>Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of HACU John Moder said the Latino-serving organization was formed in response to the underrepresentation of Hispanics in academics.</p>\n<p>“We were founded by a group of colleges and universities that had large numbers of Hispanic students and realized that there was no organization that spoke for that institution,” Moder said. “So in 1986, that group created the first definition of a Hispanic serving based on enrollment.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>HSI status opens up resources for all students, staff and faculty, so it will just help us become even stronger. – Professor of Chicana/o Studies Gerardo Aldana</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Moder, if the university accepts the title of HSI, it will have to increase its overall student involvement.</p>\n<p>“It is going to result in better services, better teaching … for all the students that are there,” Moder said, “So although we talked about it being a Hispanic Serving Institution, I don’t think you can really be Hispanic serving without also kind of upping your game for everybody.”</p>\n<p>Professor of Chicana/o Studies and Anthropology and Associate Dean of College of Creative Studies Gerardo Aldana said the recognition will allow more resources to be allocated to education and leadership skills development on campus.</p>\n<p>“HSI status opens up resources for all students, staff and faculty, so it will just help us become even stronger,” Aldana said. “To me, that is a very important message, especially as the demographics of California shift and the need for a diverse educated workforce and leadership increases.”</p>\n<p>According to Aldana, the Department of Chicana/o Studies is part of the university’s commitment to diversity reflected in the HSI status.</p>\n<p>“Our population of Chicana/o and Latina/o students has consistently increased across campus at the same time that our scholarship and academic rankings have increased,” Aldana said. “UCSB demonstrates that it is not one or the other.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to former tenant Maria Hernandez, she was not notified of the eviction until two days before the deadline. <em>Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) hosted a housing forum titled “Tenants Reclaiming Isla Vista” at the Pardall Center in I.V. yesterday in order to gather attention and support for households evicted from their homes at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The forum was the first event in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/\">a three-day campaign</a> to fight for relocation benefits of six long-term, low income residents who were evicted without justification from their apartments at Abrego Villas on Abrego Rd. in late August 2014. The forum included a presentation from IVTU representatives and a Q&amp;A session with the evicted tenants.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Ordinance No. 4444, if five or more residencies are evicted from a property within 90 days, the management company is required to provide financial support in the form of “relocation benefits.”</p>\n<p>Following their evictions, the apartments were allegedly renovated and the rent price increased by 50 percent. The tenants then contacted IVTU and an Associated Students Legal Resource Center and IVTU sponsored lawyer who then informed the tenants of the Ordinance 4444 violation potentially made by property owner Majestic Asset Management, LLC, entitling them to benefits under county law. When the tenants presented their case to Majestic, the property managers refused to grant them benefits and the tenants then challenged the landowner over the amount in small claims court, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors. In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day. – IVTU adviser and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones</p></blockquote>\n<p>Subsequent evictions have taken place over 90 days after the initial six evictions, which IVTU believe is part of an effort to avoid further requests for relocation benefits.</p>\n<p>Brian Lezak of Majestic Asset Management, LLC said the company is not directly responsible for the evictions, and that the property owner did not break any rules.</p>\n<p>“Majestic Asset Management, Inc. is not the owner of Abrego Villas, only the management company,” Lezak said. “The ownership complied with the rules and regulations as outlined in Ordinance 4444 and therefore did not violate any laws.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said the facts have not been plainly presented, and that Majestic is prepared to defend the owner of Abrego Villas.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the facts that have been publicized have been significantly distorted and are not an accurate reflection of each individual’s situation, and we intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said. “We will defend their position in court, which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said Majestic supports IVTU’s purpose, but maintains the company did not violate any regulations.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union, and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenant’s in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<p>IVTU advisor and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said the event represents an “opportunity for truly engaged community dialogue” on issues relevant to students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors,” said Jones. “In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, while there are laws in place to protect renters, the law does not require property owners to provide any justification for evictions.</p>\n<p>“The laws do not protect folks from just being evicted,” said Jones. “The property owners have a right, if you will, to evict without any just cause.”</p>\n<p>Third-year economics major and IVTU president Andrey Bogdanov said issues affecting some I.V. residents should be minded by every student who lives in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We believe that fair housing opportunities are for all, and all residents of Isla Vista should unite together to fight for this,” Bogdanov said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60267\" style=\"width: 610px\"

case will go to small claims court, where the tenants will ask that a superior court judge hear the case in order to bring more attention to their allegedly unjustified evictions.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista Tenants Union has sponsored and proved the tenants with a very qualified lawyer who has decided to take on their case,” Bogdanov said. “They have not broken any clauses in their lease in order to be served that eviction notice.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said in a series of <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/tenants-removed-from-isla-vista-apartment-building-in-mass-eviction/\">2013 evictions from 781 Embaradero Del Norte</a>, the tenants were served eviction documents in English, which they were then pressured to sign, despite some tenants’ inability to understand English.</p>\n<p>“Some of the tenants were tricked into waiving their rights,” Bogdanov said. “Some of the tenants were only Spanish speaking and some of the landlords tricked them into signing waivers of their rights which were in English.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said the tenants most recently evicted in October were not offered any justification for their evictions.</p>\n<p>“The tenants were

she lived in the Abrego Villas for 11 years before receiving her eviction notice. According to Hernandez, she did not receive word of the eviction until two days before the deadline for them to leave.</p>\n<p>“I came to the United States for a better future,” Hernandez said, “We are paying our rent, we are working … I don’t know why we are being discriminated against.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said she did not have time to find adequate housing after finding out about the eviction.</p>\n<p>“I went to sleep in a church,” Hernandez said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with us.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60229\" style=\"width: 462px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60229\" data-attachment-id=\"60229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/ivtu-holds-campaign-for-evicted-i-v-residents/tenants_anna-kodelashvili-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?fit=2464%2C1632&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2464,1632\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"18\",\"credit\":\"Picasa\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422470726\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0666666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tenants Meeting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60229\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?resize=452%2C300\" alt=\"Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus\" width=\"452\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?w=2464&amp;ssl=1 2464w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Upon eviction, owners told Hernandez she would receive her security deposit if the apartment was clean and if she cooperated with the eviction request, but wound up being denied a portion of the deposit, she said.</p>\n<p>“We left everything clean and they still took money from the deposit,” Hernandez said. “They gave back 70 or 75 dollars.”</p>\n<p>Valentina Hernandez had also lived at the Abrego Villas for 11 years before her eviction and said her daughter was pregnant at the time of the eviction.

IVTU held a meeting earlier this week, seen here, about the situation. <i>Daily Nexus File Photo</i></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) will lead a march from the Pardall Center through I.V. Friday at 1 p.m. to protest the eviction of six households from their apartments at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The march is part of IVTU’s three-day “Tenants Re-Claiming Isla Vista” <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/ivtu-holds-campaign-for-evicted-i-v-residents/\">campaign</a> created to amass support for evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas whose renovated units underwent an alleged 50 percent rent increase. The campaign aims to urge Majestic Asset Management, LLC, the management company working for Abrego Villas’ property owners, to pay the tenants’ relocation benefits, required under Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444.</p>\n<p>IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov said the march has been organized to promote justice for the evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas and to inspire further legislative action to prevent future unjustified evictions in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are requesting that Majestic Asset Management pay the tenants the relocation benefits that they rightly deserve but have not yet received,” Bogdanov said. “We would like to show to the legislatures on the county and statewide levels that Isla Vista is in need of legislative reforms and improvements to strengthen tenant variety as well as to improve the housing situation in I.V.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities. – IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bogdanov said the march is also intended to educate and unite all tenants renting spaces in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Lack of knowledge on the part of the tenants about their rights in housing issues is a big problem in Isla Vista and … affects all members of the community,” Bogdanov said. “The only way we can create a real difference is by becoming more educated and uniting to demand better housing.”</p>\n<p>California Assemblymember for Santa Barbara Das Williams said he supports the IVTU’s campaign and that without their action there would be little knowledge of the issue in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think that if they weren’t doing something that we might not even know about it,” Williams said. “I hope they will continue to engage the owners in a respectful and civil manner as something that might actually provide some benefits for the families that were involved.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said this is not a one-time issue but rather the latest in a series of evictions of low-income residents, primarily Latino families, in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to rally the community support and raise awareness about the fact that these housing issues are recurring, and ongoing” Bogdanov said. “We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities.”</p>\n<p>President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak said the property owner of Abrego Villas is responsible for the evictions that violated Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444, not Majestic Asset Management, LLC.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenants in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts. – President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lezak, Majestic Asset Management, LLC plans to present an argument in defense of the company in court.</p>\n<p>“We intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said, “We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he believes Majestic Asset Management, LLC should pay the tenants the relocation benefits he thinks they deserve.</p>\n<p>“In my mind either they should comply because they are required to do so, or because it is the right thing to do. Either way it was the intent of the county ordinance to cover situations like this,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said evictions such as these can be a result of maximization of rent returns by all I.V. landlords, which can create discrimination problems in I.V. against low-income residents.</p>\n<p>“The diversity of having families a part of Isla Vista is something that can mitigate some of the public safety concerns,” Williams said. “The most interesting, the most safe, and the most thriving neighborhoods are ones that have demographic diversity, and one of the challenges we have in Isla Vista is increasing demographic concentration.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

for assaulting a UCSB Police Department (UCPD) police officer on the evening of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-14/video-footage-of-deltopia-riot-in-isla-vista/\">the Deltopia riots</a>, has been scheduled for trial on March 24 and faces charges of assault, resisting arrest and causing great bodily injury.</p>\n<p>Edwards, who was 17 years old at the time of his arrest in April and is now being tried as an adult, allegedly struck UCPD police officer Tony Magaña in the face with a backpack containing glass bottles of liquor after being pursued by authorities down the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive on April 5. The incident sparked onlookers to begin throwing rocks and bottles at deputies who came to provide reinforcement and ultimately degenerated into a full scale riot between revelers and police, ending with police shutting down DP and firing on crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year financial math and statistics and French double major Sophie Talbot said she had just woken up from a nap when the Deltopia riots broke out and stayed inside her house on the 6500 block of DP while she watched the violence unfold.</p>\n<p>“[Edwards] should be treated as a criminal that assaulted a police officer and also as someone who ruined a community as a whole,” Talbot said in an email. “Not only did people get hurt, but it also completely screwed up a place we call home.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair and second-year art major Roberto Pérez said Edwards acted ignorantly when he assaulted Magaña.</p>\n<p>“[With] scarring an officer over something as stupid as getting away with his alcohol, he better expect repercussions for his actions,” Pérez said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds. – Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair Roberto Pérez</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Talbot, law enforcement had difficulty controlling the riots because no one could have foreseen the violence that occurred that night.</p>\n<p>“The police and I.V. could have been as prepared as they could have been,” Talbot said in an email. “Never would they have expected someone smashing a bottle on a police officer’s head.”</p>\n<p>Pérez said it is difficult to determine if the riots could have been prevented if Edwards had not assaulted Magaña because of the ambiguity that occurs with large crowds and alcohol.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s hard to say,” Pérez said in an email. “There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he hopes the events that unfolded in April are not repeated in the future.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like to see students be punished, but at the same time I don’t like to see officers be assaulted,” Schunk said. “What I really hope for is in the future we don’t see events like this occurring as often.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he thinks Isla Vista’s adaptive nature will help prevent Deltopia from being as violent as it was last spring.</p>\n<p>“I don’t foresee anything like this occurring again,” Schunk said. “I think that this year there is a collective feeling that we have to kind of change the culture of Deltopia and make it something that won’t bubble over to what it has become.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The event will be hosted by Santa Barbara Hacks, a student organization and is sponsored by Citrix, Cisco, Opengov, Microsoft, Intel, Smartstones and Major League Hacking, among others. SB Hacks is co-founded by fourth-year computer science majors Trevor Frese and Anshul Jain as well as third-year computer science major Benji Lampel.</p>\n<p>Geared towards undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. students, the event is free for all participants and will provide participating hackers with free meals. Students with advanced knowledge in computing as well as beginners can attend the event and participants can attend in groups of up to four individuals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You get to spend the weekend working on something awesome and building that one idea that you just had floating around in your head for months and just hadn’t got around to developing. Something you’ve always wanted to try or just test your limits on a new skill. – SB Hacks co-founder and fourth-year computer science major Anshul Jain</p></blockquote>\n<p>Frese said the Hackathon will include smaller events to highlight the “Santa Barbara vibe,” such as morning yoga sessions and walks to the beach.</p>\n<p>“There’s a big focus in Santa Barbara on health and wellness as well, so that has been one of our focuses of the event,” Frese said. “Although it is a 36-hour event and it’s stressful for the hackers, we want them to have the right means to stay healthy. We’ve also just added a lot of activities to the event. We have video game tournaments, silent disco and a moonlight walk on the beach.”</p>\n<p>According to Lampel, the team with the most creative and original project at the showcase will win the Grand Prize Bundle, which includes the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 and a $10,000 cash prize. Prizes will also be awarded to the winning groups in various challenges, such as Environmental Hack Challenge, Beginners Hack Challenge and Makeschool Best iOS App/Game Challenge.</p>\n<p>“Some groups work on challenges that they work on assigned by companies, while others come together to work on their own project that you’ve just never had the chance to make,” Lampel said. “At its heart it’s still a competition, and people are still there to compete for prizes. People are still trying to work on something to win, but there are a lot of ways to win.”</p>\n<p>The hackathon will give students the opportunity to develop ideas that they previously had not had the opportunity to create, Jain said.</p>\n<p>“You get to spend the weekend working on something awesome and building that one idea that you just had floating around in your head for months and just hadn’t got around to developing,” Jain said. “Something you’ve always wanted to try or just test your limits on a new skill.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We want to showcase that working here, whether you’re in college or in the industry, is totally worthwhile and amazingly fun. – SB Hacks co-founder and third-year computer science major Benji Lampel</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lampel said the hackathon will allow student groups to get critique and assistance from mentors hired by the company sponsors as well as to “meld brains with people we would never have met otherwise.”</p>\n<p>“Lots of companies will send mentors who specialize in certain systems,” Lampel said. “Because computer science is such a broad field of so many specific areas of study, it’s hard to teach someone one thing and say they are proficient computer scientists.”</p>\n<p>According to Lampel, the hackathon is open to individuals with advanced knowledge in coding as well as to those with no previous experience in the field.</p>\n<p>“There are people who come to these events to learn how to code and we think that UCSB Hacks is definitely a great place for beginners to come and learn and meet people who are very experienced in the industry,” Lampel said, “but then have the opportunity to work with them also in a very safe cooperative learning environment.”</p>\n<p>Lampel said the hackathon aims to highlight Santa Barbara as a location “on the map” of the tech industry as well as to show that it is “just how we do things here.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of starter communities in L.A., San Francisco, Silicone Valley and they’re all very big . . . I think the start-up community in SB is very different from the other places,” Lampel said. “We want to showcase that working here, whether you’re in college or in the industry, is totally worthwhile and amazingly fun.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-60180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of WorldCulture.org</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Senior Associate Dean of Enrollment and Student Academic Programs and Wellness Services Mary Jacob will begin serving as acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs on Feb. 2 following former Vice Chancellor Michael Young’s retirement, in which Young will be leaving behind his 25-year career as Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>Jacob’s career with the Division of Student Affairs began in 1996, where she has began as Director of the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) and then later became the Senior Associate Dean and Executive Director of Student Academic Support Services. During her recently previously held position as Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services, she oversaw admissions, registrar, financial aid and early academic outreach.</p>\n<p>During Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s campus announcement on Jacob’s appointment last week, Yang said Jacob is well versed in the nuances and challenges of working within education and has received numerous campus recognitions during her career.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate Dr. Jacob’s longstanding dedication to our campus and especially our students,” Yang said. “Dr. Jacob has been deeply engaged in education-related activities at the national and international levels as well. She has been recognized with a UCSB Staff Citation for Excellence Award, and a Margaret T. Getman Service to Students Award.”</p>\n<p>OISS Director Simran Singh said he has worked with Jacob since 2002 and that her past work with the university has demonstrated that she is an excellent administrator.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen her in action,” Singh said. “She’s … able to keep many different sets of needs in mind as she makes decisions.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position. – Former Vice Chancellor Michael Young</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob said her time with OISS introduced her to a broad range of operations on campus that have prepared her to assume the duties involved with leading the Student Affairs Division.</p>\n<p>“During that time I got to understand how the Graduate Division operates and how Student Affairs operates, so that gave me a very broad training,” said Jacob.</p>\n<p>Jacob also said her time with the Student Academic Support Services and Enrollment Services gave her the necessary skillset and experience she will need to take on the position.</p>\n<p>“I got greater in-depth experience within the division and on budget processes … through my work as the Executive Director and Associate Dean for Student Academic Support Services and in my current role as the Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young, who first met Jacob when she was a candidate for the position of Director of the OISS 19 years ago, said her career thus far at the university makes her an ideal fit for the position.</p>\n<p>“She’s had departmental experience as the department head, she’s had responsibility as a patrol point, she’s a senior administrator in the leadership of the Division and has been so for a number of years,” Young said. “I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position.”</p>\n<p>While her work with Young has helped prepare her to receive the chancellor’s offer to serve as Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Jacob said she was still surprised when she got the call to take on Young’s position.</p>\n<p>“[Young] has an executive group that works with him, and I’ve been a part of that group for a number of years, so I knew that he felt I was prepared if I was asked to be in this position on an interim basis,” Jacob said. “I was prepared if I were asked, but on another level I was surprised when I got a call from the chancellor.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students. – Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob also said Young has been an extraordinary leader and will be a hard act to follow.</p>\n<p>“He’s leaving enormous shoes behind to fill, and I’m going to do my best to fill them as much as I can in the time that I’m in the position,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>According to Jacob, she will continue to promote the “inclusive” campus climate and support services available to students during Young’s career.</p>\n<p>“I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young said he trusts Jacob to take on his role, but will be available with his expertise if she needs it.</p>\n<p>“I’ve told her that I won’t be around to interfere or meddle in her affairs, but I’m a phone call way or an email away for a point of view or more likely information — some detail that would be helpful to her,” Young said.</p>\n<p>According to Young, the campus community has a good future ahead of it with Jacob as its Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>“I’m prepared to be helpful in any way that she needs, but I can tell you that the campus — particularly the staff in Division of Students Affairs and the students that we serve through our programs and our initiatives — are well served with Mary Jacob as the Acting Vice Chancellor.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clinic building, where I.V. residents, students and administrators <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/community-examines-history-of-i-v-self-governance/\">continued a discussion</a> that has been taking place over the last several months regarding the establishment of self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Demographics, parking issues, legislative challenges and uncertainty surrounding I.V.’s exact population were among the issues discussed during Tuesday’s forum. The meeting is one in a series that Williams will host, with the next town hall meeting to continue the I.V. self-governance discussion scheduled for Feb. 5 at Santa Barbara Hillel on Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>Assistant Vice Chancellor for Alumni Affairs George Thurlow said there are difficulties involved with researching I.V. demographics.</p>\n<p>“I think there are going to be hidden populations that are difficult to count,” Thurlow said. “There very well could be hangers on, which are people who have gone to school here and they’re just kind of off the radar and they’re just hanging out here.”</p>\n<p>According to Thurlow, some I.V. residents live in garages and split bedrooms, a situation not accounted for in typical census counting.</p>\n<p>“There’s the situation that one of my students explained,” Thurlow said. “She lives in three-bedroom house with two people living in the garage and two people living in each bedroom. And that’s not showing up in the census data.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Women come back from work at 11 o’clock, waitressing downtown or whatever it is, and they have to park four blocks away and walk through Isla Vista. – I.V Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member Pegeen Soutar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thurow said one suggestion is to use student researchers to calculate I.V. demographics.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking to [UCSB sociology professor] Victor Rios about having his spring class do a door-to-door survey in Isla Vista just to get a demographic number,” Thurow said. “Right now what we’re trying to do is use students to figure out as close as possible how many people really live in Isla Vista and who they are.”</p>\n<p>I.V Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member Pegeen Soutar said she is concerned with the impacted parking situation in I.V and how the Campus 880 Apartments have contributed to the issue.</p>\n<p>“Now some of the property owners, even though they’re now being required to provide parking for their housing that they’re building, they’re charging for it,” Soutar said. “And so what we found when 880 went up, because you just threw three or four hundred people in, all of a sudden all those cars showed up to fill our little park parking lot and the entire neighborhood around there got even more impacted and the parking lot is sitting only partially full.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said paid permits for parking on the street in I.V. was previously suggested to solve the congested parking but was denied by the California Coastal Commission, a state agency that regulates and protects beach access to the public.</p>\n<p>“Years ago we tried it and it was going to be Isla Vista-wide and the thought was maybe it would be 50 dollars a year to help facilitate and run the program so we wouldn’t have to go after a grant or anything like that,” Soutar said. “The problem that happened with that parking plan was the Coastal Commission.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the Coastal Commission had concerns that parking permits would prohibit public access to the beach.</p>\n<p>“The Coastal Commission was like, ‘Hey if you need a permit to park in Isla Vista how are you gonna access the beach,” Souter said.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the parking problem needs to be addressed so that residents can find safe parking places near their homes.</p>\n<p>“Women come back from work at 11 o’clock, waitressing downtown or whatever it is, and they have to park four blocks away and walk through Isla Vista,” Soutar said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was really expensive to pay for the parking so they would park on the streets. – Associated Students Senator Paola De La Cruz</p></blockquote>\n<p>Local business owner Jay Freeman said the high cost of parking permits on campus can also be problematic because it causes first-year students to park in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As far as UCSB is concerned, freshman don’t really have cars because they have a process for buying permits to store cars as freshman,” Freeman said, “When you look at the permit numbers for that, virtually no one is using that process. Instead, if they’re bringing cars, they must be putting them somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator Paola De La Cruz said she agrees that many students avoid parking fees by leaving their car on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“That’s exactly what my friends would do while they were living in FT,” De la Cruz said. “It was really expensive to pay for the parking so they would park on the streets.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said students should be included in the planning process to address I.V. parking.</p>\n<p>“I would really like to see programs that offered scholarships or prizes to people who develop the best new traffic system in Isla Vista, including parking, including bike lanes,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>“At that point you get five or six different proposals in front of you and as a community we can see what we really like . . . it provides an opportunity for students involved.”</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, a representative from Williams’ office, said concrete plans must be added to AB-3, the I.V. self-governance bill proposed by Williams in the California State Assembly, which needs to be amended to include definite plans for a local government.</p>\n<p>“We absolutely have to amend the bill by mid-March in order to keep it alive or else it just goes away because now the language that’s in there can’t even be assigned to a committee,” Elliott said. “The legislature couldn’t even vote on it right now because it would do nothing . . . We could park it in a committee for however long we need.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60194\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60194\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/","id":4780,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4779,4778,4777],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"MCC Discussion Examines Obama’s Deportations","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Deportation_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Deportation_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Seasoned author and sociology professor at UC Merced Tanya Golash-Boza held a discussion on mass deportation and the racialized trends in immigrant law enforcement in the U.S. Tuesday night in the Mu...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60184\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60184\" data-attachment-id=\"60184\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/mcc-discussion-examines-obamas-deportations/deportation_stephen-manga-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Deportation_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422338832\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Deportation/MCC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Deportation_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Deportation_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60184\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Deportation_Stephen-Manga-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=356%2C475\" alt=\"UC Merced sociology professor Tanya Golash- discusses deportations under the Obama administration in a MCC talk Tuesday night.

Students and faculty also talked about the presence of undocumented students on campus and the positive influence immigrants have had on Santa Barbara’s economy.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sociology professor William Robinson said Obama has been known as the deportation president to many undocumented individuals, with more deportations occurring under his administration than any other, according to Robinson.</p>\n<p>“On the one hand he’s talking about the rights of immigrants and he’s giving temporary residency to some immigrants that meet certain conditions,” Robinson said. “Yet on the other hand, he’s deported more immigrants than any other president in about fifty to sixty years.”</p>\n<p>Robinson said immigrants to the U.S. have become the “scapegoat” for the multitude of financial and economic problems the country is currently facing, all of which are reflected in Obama’s immigration policies.</p>\n<p>“First, it’s generating a great humanitarian crisis for 12 million immigrants in the country and their families, and second, immigrants play an absolutely crucial role in sustaining the U.S., and for that matter the global economy,” Robinson said. “Third, these mass deportations without the due process is violation of international law.”</p>\n<p>According to Robinson, in order to fix what he calls the mass deportation issue in the U.S., the government must enforce a suspension on all raids and deportations of undocumented citizens. He also said undocumented individuals should have full labor, civil and political rights including automatic residency to undocumented citizens that have no record of criminal activity in the form of an easier pathway to citizenship than current exists.</p>\n<p>“This notion that you can divide the global population to citizen and immigrant is an outdated notion and one that is creating a new access of inequality worldwide,” Robinson said, “Inequality between citizens who have all these rights and immigrants who don’t have any of those rights.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them. – MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau</p></blockquote>\n<p>Robinson said it is vital that students understand issues surrounding mass deportation as urgent social and political issues that directly affect students and faculty at the university.</p>\n<p>“We have both documented and undocumented immigrants right here on campus, so they should be sensitive and aware of this issue and what’s at stake,” Robinson said.</p>\n<p>During the discussion Golash-Boza cited the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 as a starting point of racialized immigration policy in the U.S. and said that, fast-forwarding to the present day, even without a specific law stating that deportation is exclusive to a certain ethnic group, evidence shows that a majority of recent U.S. deportations have been of individuals of Latino descent.</p>\n<p>“Even though [the government] can’t directly create a law that says, ‘We aren’t going to target Latinos,’ it’s still able to happen,” Golash-Boza said. “The racial contours of immigration policy have changed, but it’s still constant.”</p>\n<p>MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau said part of the MCC’s mission is to bring attention to issues involving underrepresented populations in America.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing our part here in our community by bringing in speakers to address these hard issues,” Thibdeau said. “Mass deportation is a very sensitive topic that can be very political, but we aren’t afraid of those type of topics.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out. – Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thibdeau also said the MCC wanted to make sure students are informed of the impact governmental policies can have on the nation.</p>\n<p>“We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them,” Thibdeau said. “There may be students here that aren’t citizens for example, or maybe their parents aren’t, so it’s a very important issue to make sure we’re all aware of.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar said Golash-Boza’s discussion did a great job of explaining the essential role global capitalism has on minorities, although she also excluded some specific details.</p>\n<p>“I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out,” Salazar said. “For example, the Undocumented Youth Movement and different groups who have passed a lot of laws like the Trust Act and the new law AB60.”</p>\n<p>According to Salazar, students need to become more aware of the presence of undocumented students on campus as well as of the vital role the Santa Barbara immigrant community plays in supporting the local economy.</p>\n<p>“Whether [the students] are invested in the <em>News-Press</em> or other types of institutions, its foundation is immigrant community but at the same time its racism against the immigrant community,” Salazar said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Matthew Avalos said the discussion touched on his personal experiences as well as on the history of deportation he has learned from his classes at the university.</p>\n<p>“I am Hispanic myself and I have a lot of Hispanic friends, so I’ve heard stories of parents of friends who thought they could get deported,” Avalos said. “I just didn’t know that it had blown up to this extent and turned into such a massive problem.”</p><div

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Monday marked the beginning of HIV/AIDS Awareness Week, an event hosted by various campus organizations that aim to educate students about the pervasiveness of sexually transmitted infections worldwide in order to promote local advocacy and action.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and residential assistant Saxon Cropper is hosting the event with help from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbosl\">the Office of Student Life</a> Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, UCSB After Dark, Housing and Community Living, Pacific Pride, Queer Student Union (QSU) and Black Student Union (BSU). Yesterday featured a discussion with Pacific Pride about advancements in HIV/AIDS, and today will include a student dialogue with QSU related to HIV/AIDS and sex traffic workers. Wednesday involves a campus-wide action to wear all black, and on Friday free and discrete HIV/AIDS testing will be provided in De Anza Resource Center.</p>\n<p>Second-year English major and BSU member Ricky Barajas said the overall goal of this week is to support QSU and address HIV/AIDS as a significant issue affecting both the LGBTQ+ community and the black community.</p>\n<p>“I think that it is very important to recognize the intersections between race and sexuality, because black people account for 12 percent of the population, but over 40 percent of infected people are black,” Barajas said. “BSU supports this event because of how our community is disproportionately affected, and also because we want to stand in solidarity with other organizations and people who are striving to educate and advocate for people affected by this issue.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>My hopes are that the consciousness surrounding HIV increases and that as Gauchos we can come together and make a difference. – Event host Saxon Cropper</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cropper said the weeklong event is meant to send a reminder that HIV/AIDS is an issue that impacts everyone within an afflicted community, both directly and indirectly.</p>\n<p>“My hopes are that the consciousness surrounding HIV increases and that as Gauchos we can come together and make a difference,” Cropper said. “We can learn to be more sensitive and finally learn to protect ourselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Cropper, because there is social stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and a general lack of education on about it on campus, organizations hosting the event aim to eliminate the stigma and offer accurate information about it on campus.</p>\n<p>“By social stigma, I mean that within spaces, people have made HIV a social taboo,” Cropper said. “People should know that HIV is not a death sentence and that there are people living with HIV who are living healthy lives.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting informed is the most important factor for ensuring the longevity of students with or without AIDS. – First-year economics major Derrick Duren</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies major and QSU co-chair Roger Gonzalez said the event provides an opportunity for the university to support victims of HIV/AIDS in addition to participating in the annual AIDS walk.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara has an annual AIDS walk, but UCSB doesn’t have anything to do with it so it’s important especially for college students because it’s important for us to be aware of it on our campus and help out those who do have HIV or AIDS,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year economics major Derrick Duren, the campus benefits from events like the HIV/AIDS Awareness Week because it supports community members who struggle with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.</p>\n<p>“This AIDS Awareness Week will be an amazing way to enlighten our student body to the reality of living with STIs,” Duren said. “Getting informed is the most important factor for ensuring the longevity of students with or without AIDS.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-60158\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Eric Lichtblau details his findings in the investigation of the Nazis sponsored by the U.S. government after World War 2. <em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter in the Washington bureau of <em>New York Times</em> Eric Lichtblau spoke in Corwin Pavilion Monday night about how America became a safe haven for Hitler’s men in 1969 during the Cold War’s Operation Paperclip.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau presented recently discovered documents that discussed how Nazis were used as spies and scientists by the U.S. military and intelligence services in order to aid the race against the Soviet Union to reach the moon in 1969 via Operation Paperclip. The talk ended with a free book signing in honor of Litchtblau’s latest book entitled <em>The Nazis Next Door</em>, which took place at the entrance of Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>According to Lichblau, despite the American populous’ opposition to aiding Nazis, U.S. intelligence agencies undertook various secret efforts to protect them once they got to American soil.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that Nazis in America were paid with commodities for their work during what he called a “horribly difficult truth” in American history.</p>\n<p>“They were perceived as lazy, filthy, thieves, liars and double agents,” Lichtblau said. “But, they were still used by the U.S. in times of war and were offered packs of cigarettes and alcohol in return.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969 – Pulitzer Prize-winner Eric Lichtblau</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lichtblau, the living conditions of Nazis in America were “shameful” because they were “easily” allowed to live in the U.S. while their Jewish victims “horribly” suffered in concentration camps.</p>\n<p>“The ease of allowing Nazis in America, in my view, is shameful and is a really untold period in postwar history as thousands of Nazis came to America after the war,” Lichtblau said. “It was horribly easy for them to come and horribly difficult for the liberation of Jews in America. I cringe at this sight.”</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that although Nazi scientists aided American scientists in developing technology to go the moon in 1969, their cooperation with the government is considered “horrible.”</p>\n<p>“Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969,” Lichtblau said, “Without them, we realistically might not have entered the moon in 1969,”</p>\n<p>Litchblau also said that there were a few “good” spies that helped the U.S. perform tasks that they could not accomplish on their own.</p>\n<p>“There were some good Nazi spies that translated documents, control zones of Europe, intercepting cables, and doing other tasks that the U.S. could not do themselves,” Litchblau said, “Some of these were anti-Soviet spies whom were rewarded.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S. I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong. – First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Litchblau, the anticommunist sentiments shared by the U.S. and Nazis in America allowed Americans to channel anticommunist Nazi sentiment into work.</p>\n<p>“Anticommunists sentiments were behind the Nazi achievements because the U.S. was against communism and this helped,” Litchblau said. “There was a notion that nobody hated the Soviets more than the Nazis and the U.S. wanted to put this hatred to work.”</p>\n<p>First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim said he was alarmed that Nazis were secretly protected by the American government and that the actions of the intelligence agencies “feels gross.”</p>\n<p>“I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S.,” Jim said. “I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Ashley Miller however said Lichtblau’s talk changed her previously held perspectives on Nazis.</p>\n<p>“Currently knowing that Nazis aided Americans with scientific and spy-related achievements, it helps me to see them as a little less worse than I previously thought of them,” Miller said. “It is mind-blowing to have my perspective change.”</p>\n<p>Psychology professor Kristen Macuga said she was “quite shocked” to learn about Operation Paperclip, since she grew up in the post Pearl Harbor-era where the U.S. was portrayed as heroic in the post-World War II historical narrative.</p>\n<p>“It is quite shocking to know this,” Macuga said. “I was born weeks after Pearl Harbor in a place that made it seem that Americans were heroes who freed Jews from concentration camps. It is shocking to know that we allowed Nazis to aid us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60168\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60168\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/","id":2929,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2928,2927,2926],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Groups that were partially funded included Sigma Chi Omega, Raices De Mi Tierra, Dance Marathon, the Hong Kong Student Association, Alpha Kappa Psi, Theta Nu Kappa and the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega requested funding for $5,800 and received $2,669 for their 17th annual Multicultural Show Feb 21 in Campbell Hall. According to committee member Nadia Blant, Campbell Hall is an expensive venue to fund, therefore the committee deferred on funding the entire event.</p>\n<p>“I think the venue is super expensive and because they are multicultural, there is a lot of places they could go,” Blant said, “I think we need to cut if we are going to make all these events work, so I would fund the venue but not the performing actors.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Raices De Mi Tierra received $12,000 from their requested $15,200, while Dance Marathon requested $4,350 and received $4,150 when the committee decided not to give them $200 in material costs for the event on Feb 28 at Pavilion Gym. Dance Marathon Chair Sean Thompson, who asked for funding from the committee, said Dance Marathon is “the largest collegiate charity in the nation and is present in over 250 campuses nationwide.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB. – Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam</p></blockquote>\n<p>“We work through Children’s Miracle Network, which is a network of hospitals that are children’s hospitals and our local chapter is Santa Barbara’s Cottage Children’s Hospital, so all of the proceeds through our Dance Marathon event go to them,” Thompson said, “My favorite part is that we bring the kids from the hospital too, so you get to meet them, dance with them and play with them.”</p>\n<p>The Hong Kong Student Association asked for $3,970 and received $1,120 for the annual Lunar New Year festival on Feb. 12 at Storke Plaza and are expecting about 200 people. According to Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam, the event’s purpose is to “emulate the festival atmosphere of a traditional Asian Lunar New Year festival by bringing UCSB our cultural foods, performances, music, games and activities.”</p>\n<p>“Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB,” Tam said.</p>\n<p>Alpha Kappa Psi received $242 from their requested $282, the $40 difference due to the committee’s inability to fund water bottles for a Coffee and Donuts event on Feb 26 in the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge.</p>\n<p>“We are hosting a professional development night open to all students.

According to IVFP officials, deputies began notifying I.V. residents and property managers in November to make residents aware of the rule change come Feb. 15. The purpose of the new citations, according to the policy, will be to increase pedestrian visibility on the sidewalks and therefore increase their safety by keeping them out of the street.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the high population density in I.V. causes residents to park illegally on sidewalks to make room for more cars.</p>\n<p>“Rising costs make people want more roommates, which means more cars,” Plastino said. “They’re trying to slam more cars into a driveway that wasn’t designed that way.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties. If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk? – First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, the practice of parking on the sidewalk forces pedestrians out into the street and into the path of oncoming traffic. Citations will also be issued to allow pedestrians with physical limitations safe use of the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Third-year biochemistry major Sam Perez said he has not ever seen law enforcement officers try to keep people out of the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen I.V. Foot Patrol, or any law enforcement for that matter, make an effort to keep students out of the street here,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said the law wasn’t enforced in the past because I.V. lacked a complete sidewalk network.</p>\n<p>“You go over to Goleta and you’re not going to see a whole bunch of people just standing in the middle of the road, because they have sidewalks there,” Plastino said. “So the thought was: If you’re a pedestrian and you’re walking down DP, you need to be on the sidewalk; you can’t be in the roadway.”</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph said the enforcement does not make sense because parties tend to keep people off sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties,” Joseph said, “If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear. – IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino</p></blockquote>\n<p>Plastino said California law states that cars cannot park in a way that blocks sidewalks and that now that DP has a sidewalk running its full length, IVFP can enforce the law correctly.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that people start realizing that the sidewalks are there now, and sidewalks can be utilized for pedestrian use,” Plastino said. “If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear.”</p>\n<p>First-year biopsychology major Adam Chukhman said it would be hard to keep everyone off the street even with the new restrictions because people simply don’t want to walk on the sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“The reason people walk on the street isn’t the lack of good sidewalks,” Chukhman said, “it’s the lack of want to walk on the sidewalk.”</p>\n<p>First-year chemical engineering major, John Stair said the he does not think citations would keep people from walking in the street.</p>\n<p>“It’s clear that they want people to stay off the street and stay on the sidewalk, but that’s just never going to happen,” Stair said.</p>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, I.V. will need more funding to be able to complete sidewalk installation along El Nido, Trigo, Seville and Madrid roads, as well as the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>A panel of professors, public officials and graduate students spoke at an event titled <em>Charlie Hebdo: Defending Freedom of Speech and Fighting Islamophobia in France</em> Thursday evening in Buchanan Hall to discuss the ramifications of the terrorist attacks against the French satirical magazine <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> in Paris in early January.</p>\n<p>Sponsored by the French and Italian Department and the Arab Student Group on campus, the event included discussion on the social consequences of freedom of speech, the importance of interfaith dialogue and the political relationship between the West and the Greater Middle East. About 150 students, faculty and campus community members attended, with several audience members participating in a Q&amp;A session later in the evening that resulted in controversial debate.</p>\n<p>French Council General of Los Angeles Axel Cruau led a brief moment of silence to commemorate the 12 people killed in the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> shootings after speaking of the “heroism” displayed during follow up attacks on a Jewish supermarket days later.</p>\n<p>“We also saw in those moments of darkness, heroism, especially in the Kosher market,” Cruau said, “One of the employees, his name is Lassana Bathily, he is Muslim. He came from Mali. He saved hostages.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We may agree or disagree with its editorial policies, but just please remember, silence is the end of democracy. – Visiting Assistant Professor of French Studies Aude Jehan</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cruau said the millions of French people who gathered in unity rallies across the country “did the right thing” by protesting peacefully.</p>\n<p>“All over France, almost 4 million people gave the best answer possible to those terrorist attacks — they stood up and marched,” Cruau said. “They stood up and marched in a show of dignity, of brotherhood, to proclaim their commitment to freedom and to say a resolute ‘no’ to terrorism, to intolerance, to anti-Semitism, to racism.”</p>\n<p>Global studies professor Jan Nederveen Pieterse said geopolitical conflict was the catalyst for the events that unfolded at <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>.</p>\n<p>“Abu Grahib, Fallujah and Israel’s wars in Gaza, mentioned as motivation by the attackers in Paris, were cruel and extreme,” Pieterse said, “and extremists in the region and outside the region have responded in extreme ways, and both are unpardonable.”</p>\n<p>During the event, a slide show of some of <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>’s most controversial cartoons was shown, including one image showing a Nazi SS officer kissing a Hasidic Jew. Visiting Assistant Professor of French Studies Aude Jehan said the cartoon was made to criticize homophobic Nazi ideology and not to defame Jews or homosexuals.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a show of disrespect, but rather it shows a way to resist,” Jehan said. “Never did the publication ever call for any sort of violence.”</p>\n<p>Jehan said even if people are opposed to the content published in <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>, it is freedom of speech should be protected.</p>\n<p>“We may agree or disagree with its editorial policies, but just please remember, silence is the end of democracy,” Jehan said.</p>\n<p>Political Science graduate student Shyam Sriram said despite finding the caricatures of the prophet Mohammed “to be a form of Islamophobia,” that he, “as a Muslim,” was not offended because the Muslim community has far more significant issues to confront regarding human rights violations worldwide.</p>\n<p>“Instead of focusing so much on the cartoons, why don’t we start treating women with respect and dignity, speaking out on child marriage, female circumcision, honor killings and human trafficking?” Sriram said. “How about having an honest conversation about depression, suicide, mental health and substance abuse?”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60039\" style=\"width: 476px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60039\"

<i>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Sriram said he does not feel that Muslims need to be “constantly apologetic” for the actions of extremists and that the perpetrators of the attacks in Paris are not representative of the Muslim community</p>\n<p>“I am proud to be Muslim … and I am ashamed that anyone would pretend to be Muslim and then carry out something so heinous in the name of Allah,” Sriram said.</p>\n<p>Professor of Religious Studies Kathleen Moore said the recent media depiction of a “Clash of Civilizations” has had deep ramifications for intercultural relations between the West and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“Often, unfortunately, when terrorist attacks like <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> occur, the same tired explanations are offered alongside a portrait of Islam and irrational radical Muslim rage contrasted with a rational, balanced pluralist and democratic West,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jessica Baker said the diversity of the event’s panel allowed for dynamic and constructive discourse on issues surrounding the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> incident in Paris.</p>\n<p>“Each different panelist teaches or has a different background and had a completely different perspective or something from history to introduce,” Baker said, “so I think if this school is going to open a dialogue about this, this is the best way to start it.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Primitivo Gonzalez said he it was refreshing to listen to people speak that have a personal connection to the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> events.</p>\n<p>“I’m really glad that we have the French Department faculty members here to give their piece on what they believe about <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> because we’re kind of stuck using American outlets, or BBC,” Gonzaez said. “It’s good to hear a human being that we can possibly relate to, from the local level.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are universal values, and they should be the norm everywhere. As a human being and citizen I hope you will agree with that. – French Council General of Los Angeles Axel Cruau</p></blockquote>\n<p>President of the Arab Student Group Nada Elshaari said it was exciting to see cooperation between two separate campus entities to facilitate a discussion on a current event.</p>\n<p>“Different student organization on campus are really acclimated to activism, so you get a lot of discussions like this all the time,” Elshaari said. “When an event like this roles around, where a student org and an academic department can work together, it’s just a good thing.”</p>\n<p>In a separate interview, Cruau said people across the globe should unite to protect freedom of speech in the wake of the attacks such as the incident at <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>.</p>\n<p>“We really hope freedom of the press will be defended worldwide, and that people will live up to their commitment,” Cruau said. “Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are universal values, and they should be the norm everywhere. As a human being and citizen I hope you will agree with that.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60121\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60121\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/","id":2930,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[2929,2928,2927],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":129,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
