Migratory birds travel some or all of this distance twice a year, in search of either suitable breeding areas or more food and hospitable climates.</p>\n<p>There are also many species of birds that live on UC Santa Barbara’s campus year-round due to the mild climate, such as mallards in the pool near Storke Tower, mockingbirds on the University Center lawn and American crows at the library.</p>\n<p>“Given the habitats we have here, no other major university campus in North America has as many bird species as UCSB,” said Steve Rothstein, research professor of ecology, evolution and marine biology. “If people are going to go birdwatching in Santa Barbara County, they will go out of their way to go to Campus Lagoon and Devereaux Slough.”</p>\n<p>Graduate student Devyn Orr teaches a vertebrae zoology laboratory, a class that takes students birdwatching throughout campus and Goleta. According to Orr, 495 of the 600 species of birds documented in California have been seen in Santa Barbara County, and 209 of them can be seen on campus.</p>\n<p>“That’s a third of all species documented in the state!” Orr said in an email. “Considering how small our campus is — 1.6 square miles — relative to all 163,696 square miles of California, we host an astounding diversity of species.”</p>\n<p>Orr said the bird species on campus include common species like mourning doves, western gulls, crows and mockingbirds, which tend to be comfortable living near people and live on campus all year.</p>\n<p>The migrating species can be small and drab, while others are bright and exotic, like western tanagers and blue grosbeaks. Shorebirds like snowy plovers scurry around on the beaches, while birds of prey like ospreys, white-tailed kites and northern harriers can often be seen in the skies over campus.</p>\n<p>The variety and number of bird species on campus has changed in the last 30 years, according to Rothstein.</p>\n<p>He said there were once many more large eucalyptus trees between the residence halls and Campus Lagoon where great blue herons nested, many of which have since been cut down. Rothstein said quail disappeared from the campus when much of the brush along sidewalks was cleared for safety purposes.</p>\n<p>However, Rothstein added that campus birds are not necessarily in trouble.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that there’s been a big decline in bird species,” he said. “Things have changed a bit, but there are some species that we see more of and some that we don’t see anymore. Overall, things have been holding pretty steady.”</p>\n<p>Birds can influence seed availability and insect abundance, and meat-eating birds can help regulate the other animals’ population or make sure they decompose quickly when they die. According to Orr, climate change, land conversion, non-native species and disease can threaten bird populations and can make it challenging for them to fully carry out their natural roles.</p>\n<p>“Their loss goes beyond aesthetics, and may indirectly impact our own health and well-being,” Orr said.</p>\n<p>Jasen Liu, first-year College of Creative Studies biology major, said he was surprised few people notice the number of birds on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s crazy how no one notices how many birds there are here, especially after the winter rains, when the colorful overwintering warblers feed en masse on bugs in the lawn or when large flocks of beautiful Cedar Waxwings fill the Ficus trees when they’re in fruit,” Liu said in an email. “So essentially I would want someone who knows nothing about birds on campus to know that well, there are a shit ton present and that it is always worth it to look skywards.”</p>\n<p>Rothstein has taught a vertebrate zoology course for 41 years and said past students have approached him at birdwatcher gatherings to tell him what a profound impact the course had on them. Rothstein said people are drawn to birdwatching because, like humans, birds sense the world primarily through vision and hearing.</p>\n<p>“Unlike most mammals, we don’t have a good olfactory sense,” Rothstein said. “If we were like most mammals, we wouldn’t go birdwatching — we would go mammal sniffing.”</p>\n<p>Amanda Orens, third-year zoology major who has taken Rothstein’s class, said she thinks students would benefit from noticing the birds on campus and would understand why their presence at UCSB is so unique.</p>\n<p>“It’s when students stop seeing all of the birds on campus as just birds and see how each species is so different that the beauty of their specialization on certain habitats becomes that much more fascinating,” Orens said in an email.</p><div

This figure is an increase from the previous budget of $5 million per year for undocumented student support.</p>\n<p>The $8.4 million will be divided among three programs that are all part of the University’s Undocumented Students Initiative, which Napolitano began within weeks of assuming the presidency in fall 2013, according to a press release from her office.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the money — $5 million — will fund UC’s DREAM Loan Program, which makes student loans available to undocumented students, who are not eligible for federal financial aid.</p>\n<p>The repaid loans fund organizations designed to aid undocumented students, such as UC Santa Barbara’s Undocumented Student Services and Dream Scholars.</p>\n<p>The additional money will fund miscellaneous financial aid programs ($2.5 million a year), and UC legal services will receive the remaining $900,000 for the next three years.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

The graduation success rate takes into account student-athletes who leave UCSB in good standing or graduate elsewhere.</p>\n<p>UCSB already has many of the policies called for in Newsom’s proposal, which would require that athletes who sustain career-ending injuries be able to retain their scholarships until graduation.</p>\n<p>The plan would also prevent coaches from having the authority to deny or admit student-athletes and limit practice time to no more than 20 hours a week.</p>\n<p>Additionally, administrations on UC campuses would have increased involvement in athletic departments and student-athletes would be required to meet with academic counselors regularly if the plan passes.</p>\n<p>Bill Mahoney, UCSB associate athletics director of communications, said each team decides if student-athletes keep their scholarships after sustaining career-ending injuries. He said the UCSB athletics department does not currently mandate this decision for all teams.</p>\n<p>Mahoney also said UCSB coaches have no say in admissions decisions for student-athletes. Freshman student-athletes are required to meet with academic counselors and each team requires its student-athletes to attend study halls on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The athletics department abides by the NCAA rule limiting team practices to a maximum of 20 hours per week, according to Mahoney. Practices can exceed this limit, he said, only when school is not in session.</p>\n<p>While he recognized that many UC campuses are currently implementing many of the proposed policies, Newsom said the UC system should “lead the nation in reform” with his 14-point plan.</p>\n<p>“A lot of this is already being done, so it’s nice to codify it,” Newsom said.<br>\nGabe Vincent, a guard on UCSB’s basketball team and second-year religious studies major, said he and other student-athletes struggle to balance school and sports despite many of these policies aimed at upholding athletes’ academic performance.</p>\n<p>Vincent said he often worries that he will not graduate in four years, especially since he feels forced by his schedule to take only 12 or 13 units each quarter.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s definitely a worry,” Vincent said. “You’re expected to put the same amount of work and same amount of time [into school], but there’s a big block of your day that’s just taken out.”</p><div

eight of its residence halls.</p>\n<p>Over 98 percent of current freshmen live in residence halls, and the university hopes to make more housing available for all students as part of an <a href=\"http://ucop.edu/student-housing-initiative/\">initiative</a> authored by the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) in January.</p>\n<p>This year, all continuing students were able to apply for residency in Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and San Nicholas halls, which have traditionally housed freshman students. The five residence halls, along with Manzanita Village and Santa Catalina Hall will be increasing the amount of triple rooms for the next academic year.</p>\n<p>According to the UCSB residence hall contract for the upcoming academic year, Santa Catalina Hall will convert the highest number of rooms, beginning fall 2016 with 975 students living in triples. Santa Catalina Hall currently has 157 triple spaces, according to Mario Muñoz, associate director of Resident Placement &amp; Assignment Services.</p>\n<p>During a UC Regents meeting on Tuesday, chief financial officer Nathan Brostrom presented strategies to expedite the development of student housing, mentioning UCSB’s increased triples as an example of a campus-specific housing solution.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s enrollment has decreased after hitting its peak in 2014, students in an undergraduate population of 20,607 still struggle to find housing on campus and in Isla Vista. According to the report, over 500 students are on UCSB’s housing waitlist, with almost 15,000 students on waitlists UC-wide.</p>\n<p>UCOP’s housing initiative aims to introduce 14,000 new beds across all UC campuses by 2020 and approximately 3,800 spaces have been created since January.</p>\n<p>“The UC has housed over 34,000 students in the past year,” Bergstrom said, “Given the size and scope of this initiative, there is no one-size-fits-all model.”</p>\n<p>Nivi Lakshminarayanan, incoming first-year pre-psychology and brain sciences major, selected her first choices for housing as Santa Cruz and Anacapa Hall.</p>\n<p>“I think it’ll definitely be different, since right now I just live in my own room at my house,” she said. “I always imagined living in a double whenever I thought of college so this is definitely a change.”</p>\n<p>Many freshmen, such as Thomas Crimmel, incoming first-year geography major, select their housing based on affordability.</p>\n<p>“I was originally considering a double, but the extra 2,000 dollars a year that came along with that double definitely encouraged me to seek out a third roommate.”</p>\n<p>Housing contracts for continuing students were due in early February, and Housing &amp; Residential Services will begin deciding spaces for students who have enrolled after the freshman contract deadline on May 15.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

id=\"caption-attachment-70557\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Del Playa” seems to some a mistranslation of “to the beach,” which is “de la playa” in Spanish. <em>McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Fernanda Cerrato, a second-year political science major, moved into her apartment on Cordoba Road in September 2015, she could not help but notice the seemingly incorrect</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Spanish in many of the surrounding street names—“Del Playa” appeared to her an incorrect version of “de la playa,” which means “to the beach” in Spanish.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cerrato was born in Sonora, Mexico, and moved to a Mexican-American neighborhood of Oxnard, Calif. at 14. She now notices when people pronounce “El Colegio” with a hard “g” instead of the “h” sound used by native Spanish-speakers.</span></p>\n<p>“Everyone knew how to pronounce things in Spanish” in Oxnard, Cerrato said. “People here don’t try whatsoever to pronounce the names correctly.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bad Spanish seems to be abundant in Isla Vista’s street names, and historians say that these mistranslated titles are the work of I.V.’s earliest developers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landowners Pauline and John Ilharreguy built and named the four major streets that run parallel to the bluffs — Del Playa Drive, Sabado Tarde Road, Trigo Road and Pasado Road — in 1925.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spanish street names and “Isla Vista” were intended to keep with the Spanish colonial theme then in use by much of Santa Barbara as it rebuilt itself following the 1925 earthquake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several I.V. historians agree that the Ilharreguys were probably not good at Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista” is Spanish for Island View, but is not grammatically correct, and “Sabado Tarde” was supposed to mean “Saturday afternoon,” but Spanish-speakers typically say “Sabado por la tarde.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historians also find “Pasado” to be an odd choice. Had the Ilharreguys chosen “Pasada,” the name would have meant “passage,” but the “o” at the end changed the meaning to “overripe” or “spoiled.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether Santa Barbara County officials noticed the Spanish mistranslations, the Board of Supervisors approved and accepted the names of Isla Vista’s streets in November 1925.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three months later, attorneys Alfred W. Robertson and James R. Thompson built three long roads adjacent to the bluffs, two of which joined in a loop on the east side of Isla Vista. They named these streets “Embarcadero Del Mar” and “Embarcadero Del Norte,” meaning “Ocean Wharf” and “North Wharf.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attorneys set aside the inside of the loop for an athletic park, and they extended the four parallel roads built by the Ilharreguys. Most of the streets on the east end of I.V. kept their original names, except Pasado Road, which was renamed “Sevilla” and later became Seville Road.</span></p>\n<p>Robertson and Thompson also named the streets that crossed Embarcadero Del Mar and Embarcadero Del Norte: Cervantes Road, El Greco Road, Picasso Road, Segovia Road, Cordoba Road, Madrid Road and Seville Road. The developers named these streets after prominent Spanish artists and cities, but the streets only existed on paper at the time.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harriet and Brenda Moody, the daughters of building contractor Elmer Moody, developed a tract of land from the Ilharreguy property to Coal Oil Point, submitting a map to the county in April 1926.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite much of the planning that took place in the 1920s between these various landowners, much of Isla Vista looked as though it had never been developed by the early 1940s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historian Jennifer Hildreth Strand noted in her 1987</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">master’s thesis at UC Santa Barbara that Isla Vista was covered with bean fields, a place where “goats wandered” and “roosters crowed.”</span></p>\n<p>The streets that are now Abrego Road and Sueno Road appeared unnamed in a 1944 map of Isla Vista, when a U.S. Marine Corps base was located in place of UCSB.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the establishment of the university, developers began consulting many of the plans laid out by the Ilharreguys, Robertson and Thompson and the Moody sisters in the 1920s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county formed an Assessment District in 1960 to pave and construct much of these roads. By 1968, a map of Isla Vista indicated the newly added Camino Majorca, Fortuna Road, Fortuna Lane and Estero Road. Abrego Road and Sueno Road appeared as named streets on this map.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sueno Road seems to have referred to “dream” in Spanish, but the current spelling omits the “ñ” used in Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cerrato said it does not surprise her at all that historic developers named many of Isla Vista’s streets with little knowledge of the Spanish language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a white community, so this is expected,” Cerrato said.</span></p>\n<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">A

<em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The decision to replace Nicoletti’s with Starbucks this fall was made largely due to concern about the finances of the University Center, which is running a near $750,000 deficit since July 2015.</p>\n<p>The UCen’s Governance Board heard presentations from three coffee companies — The Coffee Bean, Peet’s and Starbucks — for the purpose of converting Nicoletti’s into “a national brand,” according to meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>“The UCen is struggling financially,” Travis Taylor, a fourth-year sociology major and voting member of the Governance Board, said, adding that replacing Nicoletti’s is part of an effort by the UCen to reduce its $745,753 deficit.</p>\n<p>“The main factor was the revenue,” Taylor said. “That’s why we even looked into changing Nicoletti’s into a different store in the first place.”</p>\n<p>Nicoletti’s will close at the end of July, leaving at least a three-month gap until Starbucks is scheduled to open on Nov. 10, according to minutes from a Governance Board meeting in April.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70517\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a

id=\"caption-attachment-70517\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Starbucks in Isla Vista (above) will be joined by a Starbucks on campus in the fall. <em>Alex Nagase / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Jillian Stout-Blackman, third-year sociology and global studies double major and barista at Nicoletti’s, said she first found out about Starbucks in the UCen by reading the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“I was just kind of shocked and confused and I still am because no one really knows what’s going on,” Stout-Blackman said. “It’s just weird that the employees aren’t being told what’s going on.”</p>\n<p>While Stout-Blackman said she rarely drinks Starbucks coffee, she said she would be excited to work at Starbucks because she has heard good things from her friends who work at other Starbucks locations.</p>\n<p>UCen officials say current Nicoletti’s workers will have priority in applying to work at the new Starbucks location, although they will need to go through Starbucks training.</p>\n<p>Peerless, the coffee roast served at Nicoletti’s, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will still be available at other coffee locations like The Arbor, and UCen Dining Services Director Sue Hawkins said coffee carts at the Student Resource Building and Humanities and Social Sciences Building will still be branded as “Nic’s.”</span></p>\n<p>The UCen will have to pay to renovate the new Starbucks location, but Samantha Moon, fourth-year statistics major who also votes on the board, said Starbucks is poised to make substantially more money than Nicoletti’s, although she and other officials declined to specify Nicoletti’s yearly revenue.</p>\n<p>“I don’t agree with commercialization,” Moon said. “But what it comes down to is we need to fix the financial situation of the UCen and this is the best way to do it.”</p>\n<p>Taylor said Starbucks generates, on average, about $1.1 million in revenue per store on California campuses, which he said is “hundreds of thousands of dollars” higher than the other companies’ proposals.</p>\n<p>Taylor and Moon are hopeful this money will help turn around the UCen’s declining financial situation, which they say is partially the result of services like Amazon which have vastly reduced the UCSB Bookstore’s textbook revenue.</p>\n<p>“The UCen should get a lot more foot traffic,” Taylor said. “People should come here more often and Starbucks is a great move in that direction.”</p>\n<p>Taylor said he has worked as a student employee since his first year at UCSB and is personally invested in the success of the UCen.</p>\n<p>“I want to see this building do well because I’m attached to it,” Taylor said. “This is a huge part of the UCSB campus and I think it’s not utilized as best as it could be by students. I hope Starbucks changes that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, May 5, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-70680\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The University of California launched the UC Smoke and Tobacco-Free Student Fellowship on Monday to fund research projects that focus on reducing the effect of tobacco products on UC campuses.</p>\n<p>California governor Jerry Brown signed a bill into law Tuesday that raises the smoking age in California to 21. Building upon the new legislation and the campus-wide Smoke Free and Tobacco Free Policy of 2014, the UC system is looking to combat tobacco on campuses.</p>\n<p>Following an application process, the UC will select four students, undergraduate or graduate, to receive $12,000 fellowships to fund their research projects regarding the reduction of health effects from campus tobacco use. These students will have one year to complete and present their research and, from there, evaluators will decide if the projects are feasible enough to implement on campus.</p>\n<p>According to Michael Takahara, chair of the UCSB Smoke and Tobacco-Free Steering Committee, the fellowship program was approved by UC President Napolitano at a meeting in February.</p>\n<p>“All of the UC campuses met with President Napolitano on Feb. 1 of this year,” Takahara said. “This was one of the recommendations and she approved it, so we’re very grateful to the Office of the President for doing that.”</p>\n<p>Associate Director of the UCSB Smoke and Tobacco-Free Steering Committee Jon Cook said he supports the fellowship program because it will educate students on the negative effects tobacco products have on the campus environment.</p>\n<p>“I will support the program as it works to educate smokers about the impacts of smoking on the campus,” Cook said in an email. “Grounds staff, as well as our PathPoint litter crew spend many hours collecting cigarette butts on campus. We have also had several garbage can fires from cigarettes being discarded improperly.”</p>\n<p>Shanni Tal, undergraduate representative of the steering committee and fourth-year psychology major, said the inclusion of student ideas through the fellowship program will help promote a smoke and tobacco-free campus.</p>\n<p>“We definitely can benefit greatly from more student-lead initiatives,” Tal said in an email. “I think this program will allow students to gain experience in the field of public health and can continue to promote a more holistically healthy environment for our community.”</p>\n<p>“Students are a great voice because students actually see what’s going on,” Takahara said. “It’s great when you have somebody who’s close to this issue being able to address it, because of that proximity … and matching that with a passionate faculty member is just something that’s wonderful.”</p>\n<p>The research possibilities are diverse, Takahara said, and allow for students and faculty members to collaborate on topics they are passionate about while simultaneously benefiting the campus environment.</p>\n<p>“They could have a project that looks at ‘what is the impact of tobacco on our environment and how can we reduce that?’ Or, they could look at ‘How can we design something that’s feasible to be more effective in our enforcement [of the smoke-free policy]’,” Takahara said.</p>\n<p>“Depending on where the student’s interest is, and their faculty member who’s supporting them, they can almost address any of these issues that they’re really passionate about and, hopefully, make a difference that will not only affect our campus, but other campuses as well.”</p>\n<p>Applications for the fellowships are now open, and can be accessed <a

id=\"caption-attachment-70664\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Nagase / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As UCSB continues to increase development each year, it is required to undertake restoration projects to mitigate the ecological impact of construction.</p>\n<p>Lisa Stratton, director of ecosystem management at Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration, has been working there since 2005, analyzing impacts of development projects, writing grants for restoration funding and communicating with officials on campus about mitigation efforts.</p>\n<p>According to Stratton, the university carries out the restoration projects because of policies included in the Coastal Act and the Clean Water Act.</p>\n<p>“Generally the goal of the Coastal Commission is to preserve and avoid impacts,” Stratton wrote in an email on Wednesday. “If that cannot be avoided, then minimize impacts and as a final, least desired alternative, impact the resource and do restoration somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 2015 Princeton Review ranking as the No. 1 Green College amongst public universities stands as a “point of pride” on the school website, and the recent construction of Manzanita Village won the Santa Barbara Sustainability Award in 2005.</p>\n<p>When the university plans to develop and potentially damage the environment of an area, they must reserve an equal area for mitigation purposes, as explained in Section 30607.1 of the California Coastal Act. “Where any dike and fill development is permitted in wetlands […] mitigation measures shall include, at a minimum, either acquisition of equivalent areas of equal or greater biological productivity or opening up equivalent areas to tidal action.”</p>\n<p>For the university, the ‘“equivalent areas of equal or greater biological productivity’” are handed over to CCBER for mitigation. Apart from the Manzanita Village and Lagoon Park, current CCBER management areas include the San Clemente wetland, the lot 38 bioswale, North Bluff and the Campus Lagoon.</p>\n<p>“Manzanita impacted a very small amount of wetland habitat and created a six-acre restoration area as mitigation along the bluff and lagoon edges,” Stratton says. Past projects, on the other hand, have not been so gentle. “North Campus Faculty housing worked around a bunch over very low quality wetlands and graded them and protected them with reduced, 25-foot buffers within the housing development plus did some mitigation on South Parcel.”</p>\n<p>This kind of environmental degradation does not go without consequences. “A total of about 25 acres of restoration is happening because of faculty housing,” Stratton adds.</p>\n<p>Manzanita’s six acres and North Campus Faculty housing’s 25, coupled with six acres of mitigation from San Clemente and three from San Joaquin, constitutes the mitigation aspect of CCBER’s restoration work on campus, according to Stratton. The total comes to about 40 acres.</p>\n<p>For Stratton, the job takes an optimistic turn in light of the positive educational and environmental change she and her colleagues create. “CCBER manages about 250 of campus’s 1000 acres, and integrates hundreds of students in our work each year as employees, interns and volunteers who help with research and restoration.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this

Housing Tenants’ Association argued in a statement Tuesday that the rent increase scheduled to begin this summer is unfair, due to what it says are subpar living conditions.</p>\n<p>On Monday, UCSB Housing and Residential Services (H&amp;RS) proposed a 12.2 percent rent increase for the West Campus Family Student Housing and a three percent rent increase at Storke Family Student Housing beginning July 1.</p>\n<p>In response to the proposed increases, the Tenants’ Association called the rent hikes “unfair,” due to what it says are poor living conditions at the residences and the extended construction of university-owned housing. The Tenants’ Association is calling upon the university, Residential Services and the Office of the President (UCOP) to end all future rent increases.</p>\n<p>Martin Shumaker, Director of Business and Financial Planning at H&amp;RS, said family student housing rent increases three percent each year, according to the department’s long-term rent plan. These increases correspond to operating costs such as labor costs and utilities, Shumaker said.</p>\n<p>Shumaker said the Tenants’ Association initially requested, in March 2014, that the university freeze rent for West Campus during the two-year construction of the Sierra Madre apartments. He said the university and the Tenants’ Association both agreed to this proposal, with a stipulation that the rates raise to fit the long-term plan at the end of the two-year period.</p>\n<p>Now that construction for Sierra Madre apartments is complete, the proposed 9.2 percent rent increase for West Campus Family Student Housing makes up for the two years of frozen rent, according to H&amp;RS officials. Combined with the annual three percent increase, this will amount to a 12.2 percent increase.</p>\n<p>Jessica Parfrey, Tenants’ Association Board president and a West Campus resident, said the Tenants’ Association’s goal is to encourage the housing department to improve the living quality at family student housing, not to “shame” the university.</p>\n<p>“There’s all this investment going on around us and no significant money being put into our living conditions, other than getting things up to code, which in my opinion is not an improvement to the amenities,” said Parfrey, third-year environmental studies and biological anthropology double major.</p>\n<p>“The three percent is standard … it happens not just in family housing; it happens in all of our residential units,” said Jessica Fougere, placement service manager of housing and residential services. “So there’s always a percentage increase; because everything goes up in cost each year, the cost of anybody living anywhere goes up.”</p>\n<p>Residents of university-owned housing have voiced concern over the rent increase and explained that issues such as unsanitary living conditions, outdated plumbing and inadequate kitchenware should invalidate higher costs for student families.</p>\n<p>“It infuriates me to think us students who come here with our families . . . have to live in these conditions, whether we like it or not, because it’s all that’s available to us in the affordable housing shortage of [Isla Vista] and larger Santa Barbara area,” said Jessica Foster, a fifth-year environmental studies major and West Campus resident, in an email.</p>\n<p>“West Campus is a half-dilapidated, subpar housing complex for student families,” said Brian Griffith, a graduate student who lives on West Campus. “We have lead-based paint in our homes. We have dirty water . . . We have, and have had, construction all around us for several years … If anything, these deteriorating living conditions deserve a rent decrease. So the least housing can do is freeze our rental rates as they are.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A featured image initially showed West Campus Faculty Housing, it now shows West Campus Family Housing.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 5, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

place to ensure workers’ safety, recounting the collapse of an eight-story building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>\n<p>“Workers complained about the conditions, but nothing was done,” Ito said. “Then, just one day, there was a huge crack in the building that led to a huge catastrophe.”</p>\n<p>Andrew Gabriel Pragin used the rally as a call to action to get more UCSB students to register to vote and voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is a beautiful place that a lot of people take for granted,” Pragin said. “I encourage you all to get more involved.”</p>\n<p>Milner-Brage saw that her work with the union was the most effective way to help students succeed in their programs and to assess whether they are being fairly compensated.</p>\n<p>“International Workers’ Day in the U.S. gets really downplayed and isn’t really well understood by the general public, so the hope with this event is to draw attention to workers’ rights on our own campus,” Milner-Brage said. “Students are workers, too.”</p>\n<p>Field Representative for the University Council-American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Marcelino Sepulveda closed the event by calling the rally a reclaiming of the labor movement.</p>\n<p>“Just know that you stand in solidarity with movements across this country — movements that are rising up to change the system … to take the power back into the people’s hands,” Sepulveda said. “The future is yours. Thank you for being awake and aware … this is the most important work that we have to do: Fight for democracy.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

However, this will not lead to abandoning meat altogether anytime soon. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Veganism is trending in both the food industry and in student requests for more vegan options on the menu, and the dining commons have heeded the call.</p>\n<p>Dining Services Dietitian Danielle Kemp said the increased popularity of plant-based foods has been relatively recent.</p>\n<p>“It’s been in the last few years, but it becomes more and more apparent,” she said in an interview on Tuesday. “I keep getting more stuff in magazines and from manufacturers about products that they’re making.”</p>\n<p>Vegan and vegetarian options have greatly increased within the past seven years, starting with the student-led push for Green Monday in 2009, a couple of years before Kemp started working with UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There was a need from the students for vegan and vegetarian options that probably happened before my time,” she said, adding that this was followed by another push from within the administration itself.</p>\n<p>A few years after the launching of Green Monday, the executive chef of the dining commons headed the development of more vegan and vegetarian entrée options. In one summer, he developed a menu and started tastings for the management staff, creating much of what the dining commons offer today.</p>\n<p>“We offer a vegan and a vegetarian entrée at each dining commons,” Kemp said. “So there are available options, usually all the time.”</p>\n<p>However, the options are never provided at all the commons for any given meal.</p>\n<p>“A student may have to go to a different dining common to find a vegan option,” she said. “So they have to kind of figure out where they need to go depending on who’s serving what.”</p>\n<p>Kemp said although there are not always entrée options available, the design of the menu allows for more flexibility.</p>\n<p>“There are other staples like baked potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice and beans that are offered all the time,” she said. “So you can be pretty creative.”</p>\n<p>Several other sources of inspiration for the food at the dining commons include conferences, magazines and food conventions. These sources serve as tools to keep the staff up to date on health discoveries, new recipes and new products.</p>\n<p>“I do think the plant-based [trend] has been growing,” she said of the current patterns within the food industry.</p>\n<p>Kemp said she is pleased about the trend and about its influence in the dining commons.</p>\n<p>“As a dietitian, you want to incorporate more plant-based foods into your diet,” Kemp said.</p>\n<p>She is sure to add that it is all about balance, and while they are providing more options for vegans, the dining commons will not be abandoning meat anytime soon.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t say we’re trying to move away from meat,” Kemp said. “We’re trying to give education on why incorporating more plant-based foods into your diet is good.”</p>\n<p><em>A

believe noise, drugs and alcohol are problems in Isla Vista. <em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Middle school and high school students convened Tuesday in Isla Vista, asking community leaders to acknowledge the need for a safe, peaceful community conducive to their busy schedules.</p>\n<p>About 35 teenage students from schools throughout Santa Barbara County presented findings from their survey of 200 I.V. residents indicating that Isla Vistans are overwhelmingly concerned about alcohol, drugs and noise in the community.</p>\n<p>For several weeks, the students split into groups and canvassed I.V., asking 200 residents — almost half of which were college students — what they found problematic in the area.</p>\n<p>Of the 200 residents surveyed, 88.5 percent said alcohol is a problem in I.V., 84 percent said drugs are a problem and 85 percent said noise is an issue on the weekends.</p>\n<p>“Some of my nights when I’m in Isla Vista doing my homework, it can be really noisy,” said one 15-year-old who presented some of the findings Tuesday. “I am a student, too.”</p>\n<p>Named “I’m a Student, Too!,” the event sought to remind UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students that there are younger students in I.V. who attend middle schools and high schools in the county.</p>\n<p>In addition to the 200 residents surveyed, the students also asked 100 locals for their favorite thing about I.V., recording responses including the beach, the warm weather, Freebirds and the Children’s Park. Nearly 80 percent of participants said they love living in I.V.</p>\n<p>The students spoke to a crowd of about 45 in the St. George Family Youth Center (formerly the I.V.

She said the noise is the most difficult part of living in I.V., adding that she often sees people smoking and drinking at a park near her house, although the problem is improving.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I’m not able to go outside to enjoy the park,” she said. “I hope it gets better. It’s gotten way better in the last few years.”</p>\n<p>Maria, a 13-year-old student at Goleta Valley Junior High, said she enjoys the beaches and getting food with friends in I.V., but gets annoyed by the noise from parties.</p>\n<p>“On weekends or holidays — Halloween or Deltopia — it gets really loud, but other days I like living here,” she said, adding that the noise “is frustrating and sometimes keeps me from sleeping.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70477\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70477\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/","id":4607,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[4606,4605,4604],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":92,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
