Senate through a resolution authored by Letters and Science Senator Olivia Campos (above) and Off-Campus Senator Tianna White. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I</span>da Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app was introduced to the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate through a resolution authored by Letters and Science Senator Olivia Campos and Off-Campus Senator Tianna White; however, it was Sir who first proposed the idea during her presidential campaign in the Spring Quarter 2019 election.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re keeping it simple,” Sir said to the Nexus, explaining that ideally, the app will have two main features: a “feed” with all Office of Student Life (OSL) organizations and A.S. events </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">similar to other social media apps, with reminders that can be customized to each student </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a notification system that would inform students of free food available on campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is, for example, a “catered event on campus with lots of leftover food” the app would then alert students, Sir explained. Users can also input their food preferences into the app and indicate any food allergies they might have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is gonna be the hook that brings people in,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, who has spoken to the Nexus several times regarding the project, said her goal is to bring “A.S. out of the dark ages” with the app, which would contain all A.S. and OSL-related sources in one place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos and White’s resolution echoed several of Sir’s points, stating A.S. resources “are in need of being updated and more readily available to the student body.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The student body does not have a cohesive source of information regarding Associated Students and the Office of Student Life events and meetings,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos said that Sir initially approached the Senate a few weeks ago, looking for the senators’ support for her project. Campos and White then offered to write the resolution in support of the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The app] follows closely with a lot of things we hoped to accomplish as a 70th Senate,” Campos said to the Nexus. She added that she believes the app will make it easier for students to see the programs and resources available to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Senate’s meeting on Wednesday night, College of Engineering Senator Diana Reyes Carrillo brought up her concerns about the app, pointing out that creating it would be “time consuming” and that it is “naive” to start the process of creating an app if there “hasn’t been research if students want one.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes Carrillo abstained from the final vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hiring of a developer would be handled by A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez, according to the resolution. During Senate, Internal Vice President Alli Adam explained that a “significant portion” of the app has already been built by UCSB Information Technology (I.T.) and that a software developer would bring the “final touch.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that Márquez plans to hire a developer within two months but does not know how long it will take the hired developer to finish the work started by I.T. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

morning, when his charges were dropped to two misdemeanor charges of stalking and vandalism. </span><em>Sophia Lovell / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third-year student, Dante Linden, is suspended indefinitely until a Title IX investigation is completed, according to Alexis — the student that reported that Linden was stalking her, who the Nexus is referring to with her first name only to protect her privacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she was informed about his suspension by the Office of Student Conduct. When asked about Linden’s status as a student, university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the university was “prohibited by law and policy from discussing the specifics of this case.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fall 2019 was Linden’s first quarter at UCSB, according to student verification records. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linden was being held on a $150,000 bail at the Santa Barbara County Jail until his arraignment on Tuesday morning, when his charges were dropped to two misdemeanor charges of stalking and vandalism. His bail was also reduced to $2,500, which he posted, and he was subsequently released Tuesday evening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judicial officer in the case, Judge Clifford R. Anderson III, made Linden’s bail contingent on his compliance with a criminal protective order that was filed the same day, which orders Linden not to contact or come within 150 yards of Alexis. Alexis said she also requested a no-contact order through the Office of Student Conduct on campus on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, Alexis said she first met Linden on Tinder at the beginning of the school year and “hooked up” with him approximately three times over the course of a week and a half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t think it was a big deal, and [he] wasn’t even the only person I was seeing or anything like that,” she said. “After that, he was just kind of weird, and not really my type … so I just cut him off, like I just ghosted him, like you do in that situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when Linden’s behavior became unstable, and he began to send her threatening and vulgar messages, Alexis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’d be like, ‘Fuck you, you’re with another guy’ or something. And I was just like, okay, [I] blocked [him] on Snapchat, like that’s easy,” she said. “And then … he was on my Instagram, saying, ‘Why did you block me?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After blocking Linden on multiple platforms, Alexis said he then began texting her, asking her to come over, what she was doing and if he could come over to her place, she said. Initially, Alexis didn’t respond, but said she eventually told Linden: “Dude, I don’t feel the same way about you; I’m talking to someone else so, yeah, leave me alone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though she later blocked him on iMessage, Alexis said the block didn’t transfer over to her laptop, where he continued to harass her.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He sent me … like 25 texts, [a] message poem thing saying, ‘I like the way your eyes moved.’ Like ‘Oh my dear Alexis.’ Like really weird stuff,” she said. “This Friday, I was talking to my friend on FaceTime and I get this random FaceTime call …  and I answer it and it’s him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she immediately ended the call, but Linden kept calling and texting her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that point I was like, stop talking to me, you’re stalking me, I’m going to report it. And he was like, ‘Alright, do it, I don’t care. Tell the feds, I don’t care,’ just kind of making a joke about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that night, while Alexis was out of town, Linden allegedly came to her room in San Rafael Hall and starting loudly knocking on her suite’s door at around midnight, according to her roommates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had [either] cut himself prior — or was cutting himself then — and wrote his name in blood on my door,” Alexis said. “And then he was scratching his nails in my door, like his name and then my name.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, Alexis’ roommates found her name and his name written on the door together in a red substance that looked like blood; Alexis provided the Nexus with a picture of the door.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They sent me a picture ‘cause I was [out of town],” Alexis said. “I saw it and I automatically had a panic attack, like I was freaking out, I was shaking, I was crying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minutes after hearing what Linden had done, Alexis made a phone call to the UCSB Police Department to report what had happened. Linden was subsequently arrested with a warrant the next afternoon near the Santa Ynez apartments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis also spoke to a San Rafael resident assistant, Dallana Jimenez, who advised her through the next steps. Jimenez also reported the incident to San Rafael Assistant Resident Director Jesse Rodriguez, who later informed Alexis in an email that he had filed a Clery Act report and Title IX report, “as is required of [his] job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to a question about why the university had not sent out an alert to the student body when notified of the incident, Estrada said in an email that “</span><b>Timely Warnings</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are issued when certain crimes (see</span> <a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/sites/www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/clery-act-crime-definitions.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act Crime Definitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) that occurred on UCSB-associated property (see</span> <a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/sites/www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/clery-act-geography.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act Geography</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) are considered a serious or continuing threat to the campus community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The decision to issue a Timely Warning is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the facts surrounding the Clery Act crime, including, but not limited to, such factors as: the nature of the crime, the serious or continuing threat to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts,” Estrada said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days following Linden’s arrest, Alexis consulted the Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E) to learn more about the resources and services available to her in dealing with the aftermath of experiencing a stalker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she also consulted with Victims Advocates in the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s office, who aided her in working out the legal end of her situation. She also said the university had offered to move her into a different dorm, but that she declined the offer, telling the Nexus that it “doesn’t do anything — if he wanted to find me, he could.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis, who said she “almost didn’t go to the C.A.R.E office,” walked in after those close to her helped change her mind; she was immediately connected with an advocate to help talk her through her situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following her appointment, Alexis said her advocate was “super helpful,” encouraging her to explore all possible options and recommending that she take her situation to the attention of the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[C.A.R.E. staff] were all really, really friendly. [My advocate] was really helpful with me. She’s helping me get an attorney [and] do this whole process.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When consulting survivors involved in situations involving legal matters, C.A.R.E assumes the role of a “liaison,” providing them with the support to take their situation to the police or Title IX through “informed decisions” facilitated by C.A.R.E, according to C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The criminal justice system is really complicated … [and] the campus reporting system is pretty complicated,” which makes dealing with harassment and stalking particularly difficult, Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A major function of our role is that liaison role, especially around following up from these entities to get updates: ‘So what’s the status of this person’s case? What are the next steps? When can they expect to hear from you again?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s really where our expertise and understanding of trauma comes into play and being able to understand how processes … re-victimize and can re-traumatize. So sometimes C.A.R.E’s role is to promote and help things happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E operates on the basis of “services,” which Conway defines as “any interaction between a client and an advocate.” A service could be as simple as a short meeting, Conway said, or more extensive — such as going to accompany a survivor for “restraining order paperwork” or an interview at the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In respects to stalking, Conway said the “threat of fear” is a lot more common in survivors, especially in situations involving a high “volume” of harassment, which can be difficult to shake off when “peace and security” is all they want.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The elements that make stalking stick out a little bit differently than the other forms of violence that we serve is around the electronic component of it,” Conway said. “All they want is the behavior to stop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the pervasiveness of stalking through texting and social media, Conway said that it’s easy for people to feel violated when stalkers find a way to circumvent their boundaries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My whole family is obviously freaking the fuck out,” Alexis said. “I called my mom crying, like, can you imagine, can you imagine?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can you imagine your daughter calling you, telling you [that] someone wrote in blood on her door? Like a stalker? It’s crazy,” she said. “[My parents] were really scared, and they kind of want me to come home and it’s crazy that that’s even an option, like that’s what I have to do [to feel safe], go home.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

[Tuesday’s] report by the NCAA Committee on Infractions is the result of an investigation that was conducted cooperatively by the NCAA enforcement staff and the university,” Bill Mahoney, associate athletics director of communications, said in a statement on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Santa Barbara is disappointed that the violations happened. The University is committed to learning from the process and continuing to promote student-athlete welfare and competition with integrity as core values of the university’s athletics department.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the track program, a former head coach, who was with the program for over 30 years and is not named in the decision, was found to have violated restrictions on “countable athletically related activities,” otherwise known as CARA. The only head coach who was with UCSB during this time was the former Head Coach Pete Dolan, according to UCSB’s website. Dolan was fired from the position in June 2018 and later filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the decision, the head coach expected student athletes to “log their training activity” during “summer months outside of the playing season and the required weekly day off during the season</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">w</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hich is prohibited under NCAA rules, according to the decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He actively monitored these logs, provided feedback on the student-athletes’ training, and in some instances admonished or otherwise disciplined student-athletes who did not complete their logs,” the decision states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the head coach was actively involved in the logs, and the training activity was “not initiated or requested solely by the student-athletes,” the NCAA considered his activities “impermissible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the men’s water polo team, the head water polo coach “impermissibly facilitated housing for one of the student-athletes who wanted to come to Santa Barbara prior to his enrollment and compete on a local water polo club team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head water polo coach during that time was Wolf Wigo, who is currently employed by the university, according to UCSB’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NCAA committee found that this led to other restricted recruiting inducements, including free meals and transportation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the head water polo coach and the assistant water polo coach were found to have improperly compensated two international student-athletes, who are not named in the decision, with “a monthly stipend that equaled the exact amount of their rent and transferred the payment directly to the student-athletes’ landlord.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two student-athletes were employed at a water polo club co-owned by the head water polo coach and the assistant water polo coach, and were paid “significantly higher” rates compared to the hourly rates of other student-athletes working in similar positions at the club, according to the decision. The two student-athletes were also found to have been occasionally paid for “work not actually performed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Tuesday’s decision, the head track coach involved is now subject to a one-year show-cause order, which follows him to any NCAA institution that he may be employed by or affiliated with between Nov. 5, 2019 and Nov. 4, 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Should the head track coach become employed in an athletically related position at an NCAA member institution during the one-year show-cause period, the head track coach shall be suspended from 30 percent of the season’s contests,” the decision writes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the NCAA decision, the head and assistant water polo coaches are subject to two-year and one-year show-cause orders respectively, which prohibit them from a number of coaching duties during their show-cause order time periods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head water polo coach, who was found to be “personally involved in arranging a recruiting inducement and providing extra benefits in the form of improper compensation and pay for work not performed,” is prohibited from all off-campus recruiting activities during this two-year period, which is applied to any NCAA-affiliated institution that they may be employed by during the period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head coach is also suspended from the first 30% of the season’s contests during the first year of the show-cause period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The provisions of this suspension require that the head water polo coach not be present in the facility where contests are held and have no contact or communication with men’s water polo coaching staff members or student-athletes during the suspension dates,” the decision read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The prohibition includes all coaching activities for the period of time that begins at 12:01 a.m. on the day of the contest and ends at 11:59 p.m. that day. During that period, the head coach may not participate in any coaching activities, including, but not limited to, team travel, practice, video study, recruiting and team meetings.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the results of any contests during this suspension will not count for the head coach’s coaching record.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the assistant water polo coach’s show-cause period, they are to be suspended from 30% of the season’s contests, a suspension that will be served after the head water polo coach’s  suspension from the first 30% of the contests is served. The provisions of the assistant coach’s show-cause period are the same as the head coach’s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the penalties on the coaches, UCSB is placed on probation for two years, beginning Nov. 5, 2019, and ending Nov. 4, 2021, and is required to pay a fine of $5,000 “plus one percent of each of the budgets for the men’s water polo, men’s cross country and women’s cross country programs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track and men’s water polo programs are also required to put limitations on their recruiting visits and reduce the scholarships they give out, based on previous self-imposed restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of the penalties listed in the decision are self-imposed, including the men’s water polo team abstaining from participating in post-season conference and NCAA tournament competition during the 2018 season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since two student-athletes involved in the water polo program violations are now considered ineligible, UCSB is required to vacate all “regular season and conference tournament records and participation in which the two ineligible student-athletes competed from the time they became ineligible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Further, UCSB’s records regarding its men’s water polo program, as well as the records of the head men’s water polo coach, shall reflect the vacated records,” the decision read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the other self-imposed restrictions, which occurred while the NCAA investigation was occuring, included the men’s water polo coaching staff being barred from recruiting communication with prospective international student-athletes from April 1, 2018, through Dec. 31, 2018, other than the student-athletes who had already verbally committed to or been signed by UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, with the track program, “UCSB reduced CARA by four hours per week for cross country student-athletes and track and field student-athletes who are also on the cross country squad list.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also required track program athletes to take two days off per week from CARA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During UCSB’s probation period, the university is required to “develop and implement a comprehensive educational program on NCAA legislation to instruct coaches, the faculty athletics representative, all athletics department personnel and all institutional staff members with responsibility for recruiting and certification legislation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, they must submit a report to the NCAA committee by Jan. 15, 2020, informing them of their implementation plan and schedule. They must also file annual compliance reports by Aug. 30 of each year of probation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Particular emphasis shall be placed on rules education and monitoring related to CARA and student-athlete employment,” according to the decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All student-athletes prospects must also be informed of UCSB’s probation status, and UCSB must “publicize specific and understandable information” about the infractions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once UCSB submits its final compliance report, and before the probation period is concluded, Chancellor Yang must also send a letter to the NCAA “affirming that UCSB’s current athletics policies and practices conform to all requirements of NCAA regulations.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omar Hernandez contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-91085\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Aly Witmer and Hannah Appel / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case — Department of Homeland Security, et al. v. Regents of the University of California, et al. — has worked its way through the federal court system and is a combination of the University of California (UC) case as well as similar DACA cases in the District of Columbia and New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was created by an executive order under former President Barack Obama in 2012. The program provides two-year repeated deferments from deportation and a work permit to individuals who arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB74r7NE0A7btCgQX8od_5u0oogA\">website</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legal battle began in September 2017 when acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607871000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDw312g5cu8l9yoc1brbCBOrktxw\">announced</a> the Trump administration was ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just three days after the decision to end DACA was announced, the UC filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, becoming the “first university board to sue the government,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-filing-amicus-briefs-support-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607874000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcVJLBEAIOAKsdIDfspxkSgAjUuw\">press release</a> from the UC Office of the President (UCOP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit puts UC President Janet Napolitano in a unique position. As president, her office is leading the fight nationwide to protect DACA — the signature legislation she helped create in 2012 as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security for the Obama administration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Neither I, nor the University of California, take the step of suing the federal government lightly, especially not the very agency that I led,” Napolitano said. “To arbitrarily and capriciously end the DACA program, which benefits our country as a whole, is not only unlawful, it is contrary to our national values and bad policy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are nearly 700,000 DACA recipients currently in the program, which includes “approximately 1,700 UC students,” according to UCOP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC-DACA-Complaint.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607872000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbbp7en5OHiiYOlbelFwnekcqrXg\">lawsuit</a> alleges the Trump administration rescinded the program on “nothing more than unreasoned executive whim,” and that its removal is “unconstitutional, unjust, and unlawful.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal court granted an injunction to temporarily stop the Department of Homeland Security’s recission of DACA in January 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an unusual attempt, President Trump tried to bypass the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s hearing of the case, moving directly to the U.S. Supreme Court — but the justices denied his appeal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case went on as scheduled to the Ninth Circuit, and in November of 2018, the court ruled in favor of the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last June, the Supreme Court announced it would hear the DACA case in November 2019, beginning oral arguments this upcoming Tuesday, with expectations to have a decision in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case presents two specific questions: whether it is up to the courts to decide DACA’s fate, and if so, whether the decision to rescind the DACA program was “arbitrary and capricious.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is no dispute that this decision has life-changing implications for nearly 700,000 DACA participants and their families,” the Regent’s briefing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/20190927151220415_18-587-Regents-Brief-for-Respondents.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607878000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEj-h4CmfaWS_4hT0IjEYZhwmfjMg\">reads</a>. “Yet the Acting Secretary provided only a single vague sentence of explanation for the decision that leaves basic questions unanswered.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-president-janet-napolitano-filing-supreme-court-brief-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzPIBYHwjcOkR8r6nf7IsxddiKjQ\">statement</a> released in September, Napolitano argued that the Trump administration acted illegally because it offered no “valid justification” for ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Five federal courts have considered this issue and found that the administration’s decision was arbitrary and capricious, and therefore unlawful,” Napolitano said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court briefing mentioned that the administration waited seven months to end the program and that Trump had previously indicated he “would allow DREAMers to stay.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Department of Homeland Security argued that DACA is illegal because it is a violation of immigration law and was enacted not through Congress, but as an executive order under former President Obama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[DACA] was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,” said former acting Secretary of Homeland Security Duke in memorandum announcing DACA’s recission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the past month, UCOP began a system-wide campaign in support of DACA, including a social media campaign where prominent UC leaders and national politicians have given reasons for why they stand with DACA recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign also includes an online <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actnow.io/embed/widget/app/vwOv7u9?parentPage%3Dd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNpdHlvZmNhbGlmb3JuaWEuZWR1L2RhY2EtYnVpbGQ%253D%26frameId%3Dj1ild&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607880000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKYXoHlNlEl8qhWsyHHYOGX-2YYA\">pledge</a> that, as of Nov. 6, totals over 10,000 signatures. The organization Home is Here organized <a href=\"https://unitedwedream.org/protect-daca-join-a-homeishere-action-on-nov-12/\">rallies</a> for Nov. 8 and 12 on the steps of the Supreme Court and nationwide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Department of Homeland Security, DACA recipients would lose authorization to work or complete their education. Besides the court case, UC leaders are working with Congress to create bipartisan legislation providing long-term legal protections for DACA recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Supreme Court does not disclose dates for its decisions, but a ruling must be made before the end of its yearly term in June 2020. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Thomas Anderle, according to Unander, who advised the plaintiffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander, who has been with the Legal Resource Center since 2003, said that across the 18 cases, the total amount sought from the management company was $24,215. Of that, the plaintiffs received $13,785 back in money initially put into security deposits and $1,200 in “bad faith” charges — meaning the plaintiffs proved the management company had acted in violation of an agreement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander emphasized that from her perspective, the owners of Isla Vista Luxury Living hadn’t acted in a malicious manner </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they just “clearly didn’t have a handle on the law the way they thought they did,” and that these cases were “a real education for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this landlord learned a lot in the three days we were in court,” she said. “They didn’t consider that they were abusing the tenants’ deposits. They really felt they were entitled to take what they took.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 12 properties listed on the Isla Vista Luxury Living website: 760 Embarcadero Del Norte, 6656 Picasso, 6659 Abrego , 6599 Madrid, 6565 Segovia, 6629 Sabado Tarde, 910 Camino Pescadero, 897 Camino Del Sur, 6578 Trigo, 6510 Sabado Tarde, 6508 Seville and 6517 El Greco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Luxury Living was created in July 2018, according to California business records. Its owners are Bijan Moshayedi and his father, Mike, who currently resides in Newport Beach; according to Unander and several of the tenants who spoke to the Nexus, a man named Keenan Duran serves as the properties’ manager. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, it was during Spring Quarter 2019 and the beginning of summer that the Isla Vista Tenants Union saw an uptick in the number of people coming in. While the union typically sees an increase when leases end, she noticed that a large number of people were complaining about the same landlord: Isla Vista Luxury Living. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One tenant, Tyler Wells, created a Facebook group to help keep track of all the complaints; as of Thursday, the group has 92 members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past several months, tenants have posted complaints and concerns about I.V. Luxury Living to the group, including duplicate charges, not receiving receipts for work done, charges for what they believed to be normal wear and tear, alleged excess charges for painting and carpet cleaning, among others </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one plaintiff posted about a $120 billing charge he received for a broken toilet paper holder, and another said they were charged $45 to replace a lightbulb. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One plaintiff and member of the Facebook group, Natalie Mazmanian in the case of Mazmanian v. Isla Vista Luxury Living, told the Nexus that, among other charges she later disputed, she had been charged for a water filter in her apartment at 760 Embarcadero Del Norte </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a water filter that had never existed in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was more the principles than it was money, honestly,” Mazmanian told the Nexus. “It was a year [under their] management, and all we ever did was have problems … [Duran] had no sort of management skills coming into this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mazmanian was also charged $559 for a cleaning fee, $90 to replace two lights in the living room and for water damage for kitchen cabinets </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">water damage, she said, that was caused by the absence of a water filter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, the Moshayedis’ first property was acquired when Bijan was a student at UC Santa Barbara in 2009. Bijan’s name is attached to at least nine properties in the Santa Barbara area, according to Santa Barbara clerk recorder records. Mike’s is attached to at least one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada confirmed that someone with the name Bijan Moshayedi attended UCSB between Fall Quarter 2007 and Summer 2011. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bijan Moshayedi and Duran did not respond to requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, the Moshayedis created Isla Vista Luxury Living after splitting from its former management company, Meridian Group Real Estate, during the summer of 2018.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deedy Hedrick, a property supervisor for Meridian who managed the Moshayedis’ properties from 2014 to summer 2018, also testified in support of some of the plaintiffs, according to Unander. Hedrick testified in one case that the amount the plaintiffs were charged for cleaning was double than what was typically charged for “extra heavy cleaning,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the eight cases that went to trial, all received money back, although the amounts awarded varied. But in two cases </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pena et al v. Isla Vista Luxury Living and McBride et al v. Isla Vista Luxury Living </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judge Anderle found that the management company had acted in bad faith and awarded the plaintiffs the full security deposits plus additional compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Court spent hours on this case trying to ferret out what and why the events occurred,” Judge Anderle wrote in his decision in Pena v. Isla Vista Luxury Living. He stated that the management company had “vastly overcharged in this case” and that the plaintiffs did “everything that could be expected of tenants.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Plaintiffs] did a thorough job of documenting the move-in and move-out. On the other hand the Luxury Living documentation was cursory at best and irresponsible at worst,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pena, a Santa Barbara City College student who asked to be referred to only by her last name, explained that when she and her partner first moved into their apartment at 6565 Segovia, it was managed by Meridian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But once Isla Vista Luxury Living took over, she said the manager, Duran repeatedly ignored her requests for routine maintenance, even one request for him to fix the “staples or nails” coming out of the carpet. When it did come time to move out, the company did not return any of her deposit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she and her partner “took pictures of everything” and “had every [communication with Duran] in text,” which she said is likely why she was awarded the full security deposit plus additional compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In McBride v. Isla Vista Luxury Living, Judge Anderle awarded the plaintiffs their full security deposit back, as well as an additional $314, in part because Duran had “told the plaintiffs there were ‘no problems’ … leading them to conclude they would get their security deposit back.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judge added that there was nothing in the move-out report “that reflects any viable issues.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelsey McBride, a class of 2019 graduate, told the Nexus that when she moved out of her apartment, her and her roommates “cleaned for two days,” adding that “it was in better condition that when we moved in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But after they moved out, even though Duran had told McBride </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with her mother as a witness </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that her whole security deposit would be returned, they only received three quarters of what they had been told. They were also charged hundreds of dollars for carpet cleaning and painting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did nothing wrong,” McBride said. “They owed us money. We took action to get that money rightfully returned to us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of money settled by plaintiffs out of court was not ava</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ilable.

The California Public Employment Relations Board has already obtained “sufficient evidence” to call for a “formal complaint” against the UC, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to AFSCME, previously undisclosed documents reveal that the UC, in some instances, allegedly amended contracts in secret after establishing a “contractual relationship” with vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, “UC’s initial 2016 contract with Lyon’s Security at UC Office of the President’s UCPath Center in Riverside required the vendor to pay their contractors UC’s </span><a href=\"https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/fairwage/faq.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[$15 an hour]</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> minimum wage. UC amended the contract in 2018 to exempt Lyon’s Security from this requirement,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/22/workers-at-some-uc-campuses-say-they-dont-earn-fair-wages/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mercury News reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a UC Los Angeles food service worker — who logged over 106 hours in two weeks — was paid under two names to avoid receiving overtime pay; the employee’s base pay was $10.50 an hour, nearly five dollars below the UC’s minimum wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a 2017 California State Auditor’s report that was critical of the UC’s “flawed” and “ignored” policies surrounding outsourcing and competitive bidding, the UC allegedly amended its protocols “to require all University locations to either allow existing contracts to expire after 10 years or submit them to renewed competitive bidding,” the document read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After 10 years, then, if UC wished to contract out work for more time, UC is supposed to put out a Request for Proposals (RFP), notify AFSCME and justify to the Union why it seeks to outsource the work for the additional period of time,” the document continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the complaint alleged that the university instead granted itself “exemptions” from its own amended policies and extended its existing contracts in secret. This allegedly occurred in secret “at least 28 times” from 2009-2019 at UCLA, when the university added an extra 17 “patient care technical titles” to its contract with AMN Healthcare, a healthcare management service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSMCE also alleged that the UC has spent more money on outsourcing — which has increased by “as much as 52% since 2016” — and has poached union employees’ prospects for employment, opting to instead hire lower wage non-contract workers to do the same jobs, according to a separate press release from AFSCME. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In analyses published by State Legislative committees considering reforms to University contracting practices, UC said it spent just over $345 million in 2016 to outsource jobs normally performed by AFSCME 3299 represented UC employees,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In August of 2019, UC notified state legislators that it now spends $523 million on these same services—a growth rate in outsourcing that is roughly three times larger than its direct employment growth for the same jobs,” the press release continued.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When contract renewals are on the table, AFSCME said it is the UC’s duty to first determine whether “[the contract] exists to save money solely on the basis of the contractor’s lower wages and benefits, and if so, to bring that work back in house.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of approving such contracts, AFSCME said the UC allegedly goes about filling those positions secretly, leaving contract employees in a “contingent” status, which keeps them at arm’s length from the benefits and wages of full-time employment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allegedly occurred at UC San Francisco, where 62 contracted employees working for Allied Barton, a security service, applied for “career positions” at UCSF, according to the document. Only 11 positions were filled despite many Allied Barton employees “applying to open positions two or more times,” the document read. AFSCME alleged this is a result of UCSF’s decision to keep workers retained to a contingent status.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the recent complaints and strike announcement, Andrew Gordon, spokesperson for the UC Office of the President (UCOP), said in an email that the UC finds that “AFSCME leaders have shown little flexibility on their unreasonable wage demands,” even after announcing its sixth strike since negotiations began in spring 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME leader’s contracting claims and continual strike activity are attempts to gain leverage in negotiations. UC’s agreements with AFSCME protect employees from displacement due to contracting and no employee can be terminated as a result of a sub-contracting decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In fact, the number of AFSCME-represented employees has actually increased systemwide by double digits over the past five years. The number of service workers has grown 16.8 percent, while the number of patient care workers has jumped 27.9 percent,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to UCOP’s stance, AFSCME finds that the UC’s treatment of its employees warrants a reaction that goes beyond the bargaining table — “the picket lines.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is so troubling about UC’s continuing illegal conduct is that it’s becoming even more prevalent,” Kathryn Lybarger, AFSCME president, said. “These complaints detail UC’s continuing systematic and often secretive efforts to replace its own employees with lower wage contractors.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Senate’s statement was posted on the A.S. Senate Facebook page on Nov. 1. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been three allegations of sexual assault brought against Sigma Pi; the first two were reported by the Nexus on </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oct. 24</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while the third was reported by the university through a timely warning sent out on Oct. 28. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura was the one who first brought up the recent allegations to the Senate during the Wednesday night meeting, emphasizing the importance of making survivors of sexual assault aware of the resources available to them through A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate then went into a working group to write a draft of the statement, which was later posted on Facebook alongside a note encouraging attendance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a town hall hosted by Students Against Sexual Assault on Nov. 14.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement condemns “unsafe spaces” and “any student organization that perpetuates the harassment and abuse of any person”; it also calls for the UCSB administration to respond to “environments that enable sexual violence.” The statement did not name any particular organization or environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its statement, the Senate added that it believes these allegations are not isolated incidents and are instead “a reflection of a greater culture that allows sexual violence to continue.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This harmful culture needs to be addressed and stopped,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Vice President Alli Adam echoed similar points in a statement to the Nexus, stating A.S. “[doesn’t] condone what’s going on in our own community and [has] no problem standing up to fellow community members and confronting this unfortunate culture.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also mentioned that the Senate emphasized the need to demonstrate support rather than simply listing resources for survivors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Something that [the senators] brought up that I thought was really powerful is they didn’t want to just list resources because students kind of feel like that’s redirecting the issue, but [the senators] all were willing to make themselves available as well. So I thought that was a really unique perspective to take, and I’m proud of that,” Adam said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement released by the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) parallels the Senate’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one should have to spend their nights out in fear. It’s on us to take a deep look at the culture that enabled this incident, and correct it,” Board President Spencer Brandt said in the statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kristie Nguyen, board director for the I.V. CSD, the problem doesn’t lie within Greek life as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some social media posts have </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said, but with the individual.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to see [people] blaming the Greek community for recreating this culture because this culture has already been prevalent throughout society. It’s a huge epidemic,” Nguyen said in a phone call with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you look into it, a lot of people in the Greek community – like fraternities – don’t condone that kind of behavior. It was more of an individual choice to make those disgusting decisions to do that to people. We shouldn’t be blaming anyone but the people who have done what they did.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD’s statement was sent out on Oct. 24 — prior to the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB to all students on Oct. 28.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said he was “incredibly frustrated and disgusted” by the alleged crime in the timely warning sent out on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that under all the scrutiny that the university is providing [Sigma Pi] right now, there was another incident, really speaks to the institutional problem, a problem with the culture,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement also lists a variety of resources for survivors of sexual assault offered by the I.V. CSD and UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t just stand by without doing something. While we’re already providing services like our interpersonal violence and sexual education and prevention program along with the survivor resource center, we also just want to continue to make it clear what our values are and how we will support survivors,” I.V. CSD Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will believe survivors and we will stand with that.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The GSA also plans to use part of its own budget to finalize said renovations, with the total cost estimated to slightly exceed $100,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Space really is a commodity on this campus,” Sorin said. “We were hoping… to reclaim [the lounge] publicly as ours, to demonstrate to the broader UCSB community that [it] is for grad students. We really don’t have anywhere else on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other renovations, the GSA intends to replace all the furniture in the lounge and patio, Sorin said, adding that accessibility for all students was considered, as the current furniture limits flexibility within the space. She said the intent with the new furniture is to make every student feel comfortable and welcome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GSA Lounge will be open 24/7, but students will need to check out a keycard from the GSA to open the locked door, according to Sorin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lounge will also be receiving four egg chairs — spherical chairs with an overhead visor — courtesy of UCSB Health and Wellness, which has a budget set aside for graduate students. The chairs will be placed into a new relaxation room, formerly an infrequently used conference room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sorin, the last renovations to the lounge were made prior to Lubach’s appointment as advisor — over 14 years ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The lounge is] a real hodgepodge, we couldn’t tell you where any of it came from,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renovations began in the middle of August and are planned to be completed by the end of fall quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just excited to get it finished… really we just want grad students to feel like they have a place on campus where they are welcome constantly anytime, day or night, and that they can get support, even if that’s just kicking back on the couch,” Sorin said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Sweeney said that it is highly unlikely that union members would reject the contract, but if they did, the union would need to re-negotiate a contract with the UC. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeney added that the contract will increase researchers’ job security by extending appointment times to at least a year for each researcher. Before the contract, researchers could receive appointments lasting as short as a month, reducing their ability to plan projects effectively, according to Sweeney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC agreed to “longer term appointments, equity and salary scale smoothing adjustments for those lower on the salary scales, [and] strict merit review deadlines” Holbrook said in an email.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal was a multi-year agreement that recognizes the significant contributions academic researchers make to UC’s academic mission, and that’s what we’ve achieved,” said Peter Chester, the UC’s executive director of labor relations, in a press release.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the UC now requires “just cause” in order to terminate a researcher in the middle of their appointment, according to Sweeney, meaning that the UC must provide warnings and a fair investigation of a researcher’s conduct before firing a researcher. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union was unable to secure comprehensive paid parental leave during the negotiations, but now employees may accrue sick and vacation days in order to use them consecutively as a substitution for parental leave, according to Sweeney. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Before this contract, you were only able to use those sick days in very limited ways. It had to be either you were sick or a family member was sick. Under the [new] contract, you can use them to take care of a baby,” Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Paid parental leave increases employee satisfaction, increases retention of women at the university, increases productivity. The costs of it are basically negligible because people end up staying longer. We think it’s really a win-win to expand this.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a joint committee between the union and the university will explore options to fund paid parental leave and create bridge funding, according to Holbrook. Bridge funding is a form of financing meant to cover immediate, short-term concerns until a method for longer-term funding is found. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While ARU and UAW 5810 settled their contracts relatively amicably with the university, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, which represents UC health care and service workers, is striking and will hold a walkout on Nov. 13 due to allegations of violations of state labor laws.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People form[ed] a union because they felt that, as researchers, they could do better work if they had more workplace protections,” Sweeney said. “Better working conditions leads to better research.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/","id":1943,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1942,1941,1940],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Real Talk Program Returns to Dorms for Second Year","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dorms_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dorms_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Real Talk program works toward creating spaces open for free-flowing discussions on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, race and gender.

While the Multicultural Awareness Program appointed coordinators in each residence hall to facilitate discussion programs, the Real Talk program will instead work toward creating spaces open for free-flowing discussions on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, race and gender, rather than keeping the focus on education-based programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duane “Deejay” Johnson, chair of the Real Talk program, explained that the Multicultural Awareness program was created in the 1980s, and in the past few years, staff noticed there was “lack of knowledge” regarding marginalized groups in the older program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, in 2019, people… have access to more knowledge surrounding race, sexuality, etc,” Johnson said. He added that Real Talk took inspiration from other programs such as Jada Pinkett Smith’s Red Table Talk, a Facebook Watch show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Johnson, the Real Talk program was established as a way for students to comfortably talk about different topics such as “race and [the] social norms of living in this society.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is designed to not ignore the educational component of teaching students in the residence halls about multiculturalism, but instead, give students the opportunity to talk about their own experiences, teach each other and create open dialogues surrounding different topics that affect all of our everyday lives,” James Forrester, a student leadership program advisor, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forrester views the Real Talk program as a chance for students to hold meaningful conversations that spark new perspectives “using key communication skills.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Assistant Resident Directors supervise each residence hall’s individual program and each have their own goals for it, according to Felipe Recinos Quant, Manzanita Village’s assistant resident director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My main goal is for RTs to become bigger in attendance. Of course, quality over quantity but I would love for discussions about social justice to continue to grow,” Recinos Quant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want there to continue to be a safe space available for the Manzi community to have discussions on social justice issues that are at times somewhat taboo to talk about.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first year of the Real Talk program was focused on tackling the “-isms” — such as racism, sexism and ableism, according to Johnson. But Johnson found that the program still felt constricting —  the point was for the conversations to be free-flowing. Now, facilitators are trained not to give their personal opinions, but instead to guide conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Real Talk has a motto: they do the before, during and the continuing. Before consists of checking themselves — are they able to deliver this, are they able to educate on this topic, do they hold personal biases?” Johnson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During the session [the facilitators] set ground rules and look for signs in the audience of anger, discomfort, frustration. The continuing involves continuously asking questions and reminding the group of the facts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facilitators are trained before beginning their programs and have separate planning sessions to research and plan for their upcoming Real Talks, according to Forrester. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though there are many components to this program and its predecessor, the overall intention remains the same, Johnson said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My hope is that students attend, engage — even with those who have different ideas in these spaces and talk these things out and hear these things out. Real Talk provides a space to ask questions and feel supported in the presence of their peers.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-87302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Deltopia (pictured in 2019) is typically a break-all-the-rules block party. Ludicity’s proposal would provide an alternative festival to Deltopia. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial proposal of a festival led many UC Santa Barbara students and community members to believe that Lucidity’s event would completely shut down Deltopia, as expressed at the town hall. However, members of Lucidity’s board of directors negated these rumors and expressed its hopes that the alternative festival would develop a more positive, fun-filled environment that would help channel the Deltopia crowds into a safer space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not invested in doing this if people don’t want it,” Lucidity Director Ron Glover said. “We were asked to come and we decided we’d give it a shot… we don’t have a magic wand, but we’ve been successful at what we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has faced pushback from both sides of the community around its involvement in the event. Some UCSB students have expressed concern over parting with their beloved Deltopia tradition, while other Isla Vista residents present at the town hall noted they would prefer to abolish the event entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was [an] overwhelming response that students don’t want to see it rebranded,” Lucidity Founder and Marketing Director Jonah Gabriel Haas said. “It comes from an idea that this is going to change or take away their beloved Deltopia party, and that’s not what we’re trying to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/lucidity-festival-budget-reduced-by-20000-following-district-concerns/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> its proposed Deltopia festival budget by $20,000, leaving it with a $159,850 price tag in order to get the program underway, which places special emphasis on harm reduction and collaboration with the community. This includes the unique concept of “Guardians,” a specially trained group of people dedicated to de-escalating situations to reduce the need for law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Guardian team would serve as a buffer between students and law enforcement so that the vast majority of things, whether they be medical or conflicts, can be de-escalated, mediated and taken care of before escalating to law enforcement,” Haas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the town hall, many concerned community members placed an emphasis on their fear of outsiders coming into I.V. and wreaking havoc with no sense of personal responsibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haas noted that Lucidity’s goal is “to make the event awesome enough for crowds to come off Del Playa, but not so awesome that we attract huge out-of-town crowds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team hopes to accomplish this by enlisting local artists to play at two different stages in Anisq’Oyo’ Park and People’s Park, which will hopefully encourage students to enjoy the music without drawing in outsiders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity also explained its hopes for a more family-friendly event in the future. However, the team acknowledged that since this is the first iteration of the event, they wanted to prioritize the age range that the original Deltopia appealed to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiyomi Morrison, UCSB’s A.S. Program Board commissioner, expressed her fears that Lucidity’s event would take away from the Program Board’s Warm Up event, which aims to act as a safe space that provides live music, drinks, snacks and other necessities to potentially inebriated students after Deltopia. She explained that after Deltopia and a Lucidity Festival, students might be too tired to attend the school-sanctioned nighttime event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also raised concern regarding the price tag, which the I.V. Community Services District explained would be covered by the district and other organizations who could potentially support the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree that I think trying stuff is important and you won’t know… but it’s a $159,000 try,” Morrison said. “Can you justify spending that much on this event, rather than medical tents, drug testing, water or food that could help Deltopia in another way?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Lucidity returned to the point made at the beginning of the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If this works, it works, and we couldn’t ask for anything better,” Glover said. “If it doesn’t, we won’t do it again… instead of not trying, and saying what if it doesn’t work, well, what if it does?”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">panel was made up of leaders from Food and Water Action, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mixteco/Indígena Community Organizing Project (MICOP), the Community Environmental Council (CEC) and Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy (CAUSE). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the groups are members of the C3JN and are specialists on specific local economic and social climate concerns; C3JN</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a group that has been working together for two years to achieve more transactional climate action. Ana Rosa Rizo-Centino, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senior Central Coast organizer for Food and Water Action, said that C3JN is a blueprint for what other areas can be doing to best address climate challenges. It focuses on how whole community involvement produces the most effective results. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After making presentations about their organizations, community climate leaders opened up the floor to take questions from the audience and discuss community climate concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening centered around the importance of community collaboration to achieve a Green New Deal suited to the Central Coast; Vanessa Terán, policy and communications associate for MICOP, emphasized that “it’s going to take all of us to build the movement that we want to see and the change we want to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent Montecito mudslides and Thomas Fire, which devastated areas of Santa Barbara County, were big topics of discussion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These events put our work in greater perspective,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sigrid Wright, the CEO and executive director for the CEC said</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, referencing working on climate policies in the face of natural disasters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Pellow, director of the environmental studies department at UCSB, said the Green New Deal will look different for various solutions depending on areas’ geographic and economic dynamics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Santa Barbara area, this involves reducing emissions, creating sustainable local jobs and revolutionizing transportation systems, according to Pellow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wright added that the close proximity of Santa Barbara’s highways and train systems to the ocean makes them particularly vulnerable to climate effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Much of our critical infrastructure is at risk,” Wright said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron Gray, transportation and climate manager for the CEC, further explained that “40% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation systems.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that greenhouse gas emissions need to be decreased in order to significantly reduce climate change; in the Santa Barbara area, this would mean changing the number of electric cars, moving jobs closer to where people live and improving public transportation to reduce congestion along Highway 101.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students were curious about how they could take action themselves.

This is a demonstration to SUPPORT and STAND with survivors,” the organizers wrote Wednesday night on the Intersectional Feminists’ </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B4RWA8ZJUbB/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary event organizers, Eli Diaz, Alana Ulloa and Kyremina Youssef, began planning the event on Monday, starting with two organizations and eventually growing to 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They originally planned to publish a list of demands for the university on Thursday morning that students would have been able to sign on to support at the demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In place of a list of demands, the organizers instead presented attendees with a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScm7FZrdK3bFI_U12QGWji2mt1M6z6JK5dWMR9wMv1uyo_J6A/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Form</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that asked people their name and affiliation with UCSB or Isla Vista. The form also prompted them to answer the question, “What demands would you like to see be enacted on campus and in Isla Vista?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really want to make sure these demands are representative of what the student collective wants,” Ulloa said, adding that they would most likely release the demands in about a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of Thursday’s demonstration, the petition had received over 800 signatures, according to Diaz, who said they “don’t plan on closing [the petition] off anytime soon.” Despite not having a list of demands prepared at the Thursday protest, Diaz found “it’s better to get the input from the wider student populace before we finalize that list.”</span></p>\n<p><b>“</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because of the volume of feedback that we’ve gotten, especially from the Google Form, we definitely want to take an appropriate amount of time to really comb through that and really take the time to incorporate that into whatever list gets made,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dozens of students, some affiliated with participating organizations and some on their own, held up signs and talked to those walking through the Arbor about signing the petition through a QR code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For second-year student Hannah Ezell, the decision to sign the petition was a simple one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s just important for everyone to participate … it’s yes or no; it’s a pretty clear answer of what needs to be happening, so I did it without question,” Ezell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If getting involved in an organization isn’t for you, just talk to your friends about it and learn about what other people’s takes are on it. The more you know, I think the more you can grow and the more you can teach other people from what you have learned.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year economics major Devin Dohrmann also decided to join in solidarity, saying that he believed a misogynistic society is at fault for the recent events in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more male voices which you have, I feel, the more likely other men are to listen to you, because the people who are committing these rapes are already being conditioned by a really misogynistic society to not listen to women,” Dohrmann said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organizers also emphasized the importance of creating an activist coalition through the demonstration. Over 15 organizations signed up to collaborate with Intersectional Feminists, including campus resources such as Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) and student-led groups like Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For SASA, it was important to use the demonstration as a way to share resources that are available to survivors to help them navigate what they can do after being sexually assaulted, according to Francisco Trejo, a fourth-year biology major manning SASA’s table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Intersectional Feminists has taken the lead on putting together the demands, SASA has been figuring out “how much is actually feasible for the administration to implement,” Trejo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two weeks ago, SASA met with several administrators to discuss the university’s response to the latest allegations of sexual assault, according to Trejo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re always in the process of figuring out what more we can ask of [the university] to do for the student body and how we can more effectively communicate with them,” he added. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90929\" style=\"width: 1830px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img

Multipurpose Room of the Student Resource Building to address students’ concerns about the recent reports of sexual assault. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA is also partnering with C.A.R.E. to create a new prevention education curriculum, according to C.A.R.E.’s Assistant Director of Prevention Education Sven Rundman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been working with SASA to develop curriculum that we’re launching this year for all campus organizations … [and] also for Greek life as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planned Parenthood Generation Action, an on-campus organization that functions as a political arm of Planned Parenthood, was another student group that set up a table at Thursday’s demonstration with the intention of providing students with information about resources in the area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a survivor, I want to show the resources that helped me at Planned Parenthood when I needed that support,” said Megan Ashley, third-year vocal performance major who represented Planned Parenthood Generation Action at Thursday’s demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joan Hartmann, third district supervisor for Santa Barbara County and a representative of Isla Vista and UCSB, was originally only on campus to meet with Planned Parenthood Generation Action when she learned about the demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m here because I want to stand with survivors and highlight the importance of this issue,” Hartmann said. “This is unacceptable, and we really need to change people’s minds about what it means to be a man in our society.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann also applauded quick organization of the demonstration by Diaz, Ulloa and Youssef, and the large coalition of campus organizations that had come together in just a few days. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This really speaks to one, the organizational abilities of those who put this together and two, how serious everyone takes [allegations of sexual assault] on campus,” Hartmann said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann said she was also excited by the fact that the petition in circulation wasn’t just a set of demands, but an invitation for students to provide their input on what changes needed to be made. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the beginning of a discussion to pull together ideas,” she said. “I want to be part of the discussion, and I want to be part of the answer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt ‘19, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, noted that it seemed as if the university was back where it was several years ago, when students held a </span><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office with a list of demands to reform the way the university addressed sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The frustration is palpable, to still be here three years later,” he said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In between now and then, we’ve had the #MeToo movement, which has brought a lot of issues of sexual violence and harassment into the national context,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Echoing Hartmann’s points, Brandt applauded the efforts of the students who put together the demonstration and the efforts of those who have pushed for conversations about addressing sexual violence on campus and in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that what’s really important is that students are the ones who are leading this movement,” he said. “Students have come together and said ‘enough is enough’ before, and I think that’s what needs to happen again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the local politicians present at Thursday’s demonstration, several university administrators attended the event to show their support, including Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, and Katya Armistead, dean of student life, who co-signed an email sent to all UCSB students Wednesday night regarding the recent sexual assaults and university communications with students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took us a long time to get that statement out, and quite honestly, that hurts my heart,” Armistead said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the concerns she has heard from students were that the university hadn’t been communicating enough with students and that the administrators were planning on continuing to send emails to students explaining the situation and what the university was doing in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Student Affairs administration will be holding a town hall next Wednesday, Nov. 6, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Multipurpose Room of the Student Resource Building to address students’ concerns about the recent reports of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef emphasized that she hopes the conversation around sexual assault will continue with administrators after the demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is something we want to keep in discussion with UC admin and just keeping it in discussion from now on. This is just the start, and we want to keep doing things as well,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the demonstration can be seen <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/in-photos-protect-survivors-not-frats-students-hold-demonstration-following-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
