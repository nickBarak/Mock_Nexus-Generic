The measure needed a two-thirds majority in order to pass.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting in June, I.V. property owners will be taxed $28.75 per household bedroom and 7.185 cents per square foot of commercial space annually for the next 10 years. The revenue will go toward The Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD), the special district that maintains I.V. parks and infrastructure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

“backlog of deferred maintenance” in I.V.’s parks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pegeen Soutar, the IVRPD board chair, told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:

District.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Measure O passed Tuesday night, Soutar said the special tax adds “a nice amount of money” for IVRPD to “do improvements that will directly affect everyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is wonderful, and it’s really wonderful for Isla Vista, too,” she said. “In the end, it’s this funding that will really help create community in Isla Vista.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county elections office will be continuing to count late mail-in ballots for the next few days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m pretty darn sure they’re all going to be ‘yes,’” Soutar said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

(SBSO) responded to a report of battery near Highway 101 in the Arroyo Quemada area west of Refugio State Beach on April 15.</p>\n<p>A 63-year-old Santa Paula resident was sitting in a parked car near Refugio State Beach at approximately 1 p.m. when a male suspect attacked him with a guitar, police said.</p>\n<p>Police said the suspect allegedly attacked the elderly man because he believed he was homosexual. The male suspect shouted homophobic slurs during the attack, police said, and the victim was hospitalized with a “traumatic injury.”</p>\n<p>Police spoke to the victim when they arrived on scene and launched a several-week-long investigation to identify and locate the suspect thereafter.</p>\n<p>Police ultimately identified the suspect as Daniel Joseph Garcia, a 19-year-old I.V. resident. After obtaining a court warrant, SBSO deputies searched Garcia’s I.V. residence but were unable to locate him.</p>\n<p>Deputies then obtained an arrest warrant and found that Garcia was in custody in Monterey County. Several hours after the elderly man was attacked on April 15, California Highway Patrol arrested Garcia in Monterey County on unrelated charge of assault with a deadly weapon and driving under the influence.</p>\n<p>Police said on Friday that they plan to transport Garcia to Santa Barbara County to face charges after the disposition of his Monterey County charges.</p><div

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza, a UC San Diego alum, last came to UCSB nearly 10 years ago when she worked for the University of California Student Association.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting the tone for an intersectional conversation about social justice, Garza welcomed the full auditorium by asking the audience to acknowledge that they were standing on land once occupied by Chumash indigenous people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then expressed her support for the list of demands from the Black Student Union, Black Student Engagement program and Black Resource Committee, which includes ensuring that black students make up more than 5 percent of the university’s student population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also supported the idea to hire two full-time black psychologists on campus and spoke of the psychological effects of controversial speakers invited to the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Emotional wellness is important for everybody, not just black students,” she said, “but certainly in a campus environment, where I hear there was just a speaker here talking about the lies and division of Black Lives Matter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Shapiro spoke at Campbell Hall in February for his event titled “Lies, Prejudice, and Division: The Legacy of the #BLM Movement,” which was later named “The Regressive Left, ‘Social Justice’ and #BlackLivesMatter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said narratives of history impact our present and future. She said “this country is powered by the engine of amnesia” because historical aspects are often “conveniently” left out in conversation about BLM.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza went on to say that the nation has a history of racially prejudiced “laws, policies and practices,” which she said are “deliberately designed to rob some of power in favor of giving others power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that of the “two million people locked up … one million of those people” are African American. She said they are not incarcerated because they are “inherently criminal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is not liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican; this is just what is,” she said. “It’s because there are laws that disproportionately target black people for things that all people do, but not all people get put in cages for their lives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This July will mark the four-year anniversary of BLM, and Garza said she wanted to make it clear that it is not just a movement for black lives, “but a movement to save all of our lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said there are misunderstandings of the movement that distract from its message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black Lives Matter started as a love note to black people, but it is a demand and a call to action,” Garza said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77388\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77388\" data-attachment-id=\"77388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/alicia-garza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alicia Garza-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77388\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said this movement began in generations prior to hers and is now a continuation of a long legacy of struggle in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also outlined three “myths” of BLM: the notions that it is anti-police, anti-white and black supremacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said the movement is not anti-police, but, rather, it is against the perpetuation of cycles of violence. She said she believes the cycle will end when someone is courageous enough to say that the institutions and systems in place “are not working.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also said the allegation that BLM is a black supremacy group “just doesn’t make sense.” The activist group does not want to perpetuate the same systems that oppress people but, rather, to transform the powers that operate those systems, Garza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Dolan, associate director at the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity and one of the organizers for the event, said BLM week is about “coalition building.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolan said they believe the event was an effective way to bring people together and “center the Black Lives Matter movement on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabiola Pérez, a fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she thought Garza made “all these issues human” and spoke about them in realistic terms.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like a lot of the stuff we see is so out there and it feels so far away, when in reality it’s very immediate and very close,” Pérez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said she wanted the audience to leave thinking about “the ways we want to create movement and the ways we establish power.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the U.S. needs “really courageous white people” to realize white supremacy does exist, adding that economic struggles are national concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “White folks need this movement,” she said. “They’re being fed a lie, too.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCOP allegedly removed campus statements that were critical of UCOP, sending more positive, edited versions to the state auditor’s office instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor questions in the report whether the office will make a “genuine effort to change” because of such an interference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because the Office of the President inappropriately inserted itself into the survey process, auditing standards prohibit us from drawing conclusions based on the survey results,” the report read. “As a result, the Office of the President missed an opportunity to receive feedback from its key stakeholders, and it demonstrated an unwillingness to receive constructive feedback.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A letter dated April 5 sent from UC President Janet Napolitano to State Auditor Elaine Howle addressed these claims. Napolitano said the report “fundamentally and unfairly mischaracterizes UCOP’s budget practices,” but she said UCOP welcomes the input and finds the recommendations “helpful.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the audit, UCOP Budget Director Eva Goode told the state auditor that UCOP can use the discretionary funds for any project within UCOP or any of the campuses. The state auditor said, however, that this contradicts a 2006 policy passed by the Regents prohibiting UCOP from spending any funding until the Regents approve a budget each year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor said UCOP believed disclosing these funds was unnecessary since Regents had approved the spending in previous years. However, the state auditor said there was no evidence provided to dispute the agency’s claims.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit also calls this into question because administrative expenses have increased by $80 million from 2012 to 2016, an increase of 28 percent in four years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit also states UCOP provided little information about the budget and that the information available is sometimes misleading, which the state auditor said makes it “difficult, if not impossible” for the Regents and state legislature to understand the budget and operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor’s office analyzed 10 executive positions and found they were paid a total of $3.7 million, over $700,000 more than the combined salaries of comparable state executives. The senior vice president for governmental relations was paid $130,000 more than the top three highest paid employees in similar state positions, the state auditor reported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the audit, UCOP uses salary survey data coming almost entirely from the private sector to determine salaries, but this is much higher than typical for state employees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor said UCOP defended the increased salaries by stating the higher education environment necessitates higher pay, but the state auditor’s office found this insufficient with regard to administrative staff like financial analysts who have similar tasks regardless of who they work for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor also alleged employee benefits within the UC are significantly higher than standard, with UCOP spending at least $21.6 million from 2011 to 2016 on employee benefits. Such benefits are not typical within the public sector, the state auditor said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The office also spent over $2 million on business meetings and entertainment expenses over five years, according to the audit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the extent of the concerns identified, the state auditor’s office recommends significant reforms including reallocating savings to campuses, setting targets for reduced salaries and implementing practices for budgeting ensuring accountability and purposeful use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano’s letter addresses many areas of the draft which she believes misrepresent UCOP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She first said the $175 million figure the audit quoted was actually $38 million of available and uncommitted reserve. She also said $175 million is an inaccurate figure, since $5 million of that amount is not UCOP-related “balance fund data.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano further broke down the $170 million figure, saying that $83 million of it is restricted and $87 million of it is unrestricted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $83 million of restricted funds support a “range of programs and initiatives,” Napolitano said. These include support for the UC Washington Center, UC health and lab research grant programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the $87 million of unrestricted funds, $49 million are already committed to various programs including but not limited to support for UC Merced, law students and the creation of a new medical school.

According to Deputy Chief of Staff Maya Halthore, 60-70 students applied and 40 were able to go to Washington D.C. with USSA in March to lobby for Pell Grant expansion and protection, increased financial aid and DACA protection for undocumented students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her term, Nayak also focused on mental health through Chai Talks and a S.T.E.M. mental health panel.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“In terms of Chai Talks, I think it’s important to have a space on campus where students can speak on islamophobia, parental pressure, just things South Asian students, things that are related to their communities specifically, and I think that has been something that has not been spoken of or vocally emphasized” Nayak said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also takes pride in her S.T.E.M. mental health panel, which just started this quarter. She described it as a “working group” that meets every quarter to ensure that students within S.T.E.M. programs are aware of mental health resources.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I did what I wanted to do,” Nayak said, but she still wishes she could have done more regarding tracking legislation and voter registration.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Having a lot more internal communication with other entities that are already doing voter reg. is very important, and I could have improved on that,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also said that she wished she had further increased student outreach to ensure that different students and “young student leaders” are applying to attend various conferences instead of the same people going multiple times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kristin Hsu, the EVPSA chief of staff, also believes there are things that could have been done better.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Not everyone’s perfect, and I think Neha knows she’s not perfect,” said Hsu. “I think we could have done more outreach; we could have perhaps recruited more student leaders within the office; we could have gotten more staff members in the office … I think as long as you are constantly trying and making those efforts to do that outreach and go to meetings, to advertise whatever opportunities you have, you are doing your job.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s hard, because EVPSA is such a broad scope,” Nayak said. For the future, she hopes that the next EVPSA can create an easily accessible bill tracker to make students aware of legislation that may affect them.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite the setbacks, she is leaving behind a positive legacy with her staff.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I loved working with Neha. Obviously, entering EVPSA, there were bumps in the road with all of us, but Neha consistently served as a positive force within the office, being encouraging and present,” said Halthore.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As a graduating senior, Nayak looks toward a future away from politics, likely in marketing. She said, “maybe in the way future, [she’ll] run for office, for, like, state congress, but not anytime soon, that’s for sure.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite her reluctance to go into politics, she believes her experience working within A.S. and as EVPSA will guide her in her life.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“That’s something I’ll take for the rest of my life: just the knowledge of knowing how to be involved in these different communities, help these communities on campus, attend board meetings all across the state, fly to D.C. to advocate for issues that are so important to students and are essentially the lifeline of students. That has been such a growing experience for me. I wouldn’t trade it for anything else for my senior year.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She parted with some advice for future EVPSAs:</p>\n<p>“There will be ups and downs, but learn from the failures and learn from your experiences because that’s what makes you a better elected official, and in the end, you’re there for the students. You chose to run because you wanted to help UCSB students; keep that in mind when things get hard.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The student group UC Santa Barbara Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) released a resolution this Sunday calling for Associated Students to divest from companies that contribute to what SJP calls an occupation of Palestine.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The resolution calls for the university to examine and promptly disinvest from its assets that provide support for “occupying” Palestinian territories, building a wall in a highly disputed area, the West Bank, or developing Israeli settlements on “annexed” territories.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">SJP called for A.S., UCSB and the Regents to divest from Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard in particular, though it said these are not the only companies contributing to Palestinian oppression, and the UC should divest from any of its assets profiting from such actions.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The resolution was released on the night of Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel. Critics believed the resolution’s timing was purposefully malicious. SJP released a statement on their Facebook page denouncing the implication that the post was anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The proposal was endorsed by 25 other student organizations including the A.S. Student Commission on Racial Equality, El Congreso and the Student Activist Network.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Anumita Kaur, SJP member and fourth-year sociology major, sponsored the resolution, which she said SJP plans to place on the A.S. Senate agenda next week.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said the student organization had two goals in creating the resolution, the first being the “tangible ask” of demanding UCSB and the UC system to remove funds from corporations that allegedly assist in violence against the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said the resolution was also meant to be a way for the UC system to be held accountable and to focus on making ethical investments at all times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said the organization’s second goal was to educate people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A lot of people can’t even point to where Palestine is on the map, and it’s so important that people understand that this is a violence occurring on our globe,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In an accompanying press release made public on Sunday, SJP said its resolution “is in no way intended to alienate students on campus; it is intended to create a critical dialogue about regimes participating in human rights violations.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The statement added that students were critical to social movements in the past and that UCSB must answer its duty as a top-level institution.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Students have historically been at the forefront of social justice movements, from the Civil Rights Movement to South African Apartheid, student power has been an integral part of progress and change,” the statement read.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Belonging to a top tier research institution, it is our duty to combat racism, patriarchy, homophobia, transphobia, imperialism, colonization and global inequality. We cannot exceptionalize Israel.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sunday’s resolution and press release are part of a years-long student effort to call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a “nonviolent movement that was called for by Palestinian Civil Society in 2005 in response to Israel’s disregard for international law,” as the statement describes it.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said she believes if people were more understanding of SJP’s perspective, they might have less “volatile opinions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think the biggest thing to understand about this movement and this resolution is that it’s really just premised on love; it’s premised on, you know, a desire for global humanity,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“All it is in its inherent nature is asking the university to remove funds from American corporations that assist in violence against a people.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77403\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77403\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/","id":2392,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2391,2390,2389],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: I.V.

First Friday to backyard concerts, free vegan food, tree planting and more. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>FIRST FRIDAY</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ever wondered which bands are blasting rock music from Lot 22? Now’s your chance to get up close and personal with one of the bands, The Mallards, who will be performing at I.V.’s First Friday in Anisq’Oyo’ Park at 6 p.m. This event was originally scheduled for April 7 but was postponed due to inclement weather.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>COMEDY DEAL</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In need of some laughs? On the hunt for a good deal? Why not both? This Friday, Improvability will be hosting a “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” themed show, and tickets are buy one, get one free when you say the secret code word: bogo. There are two shows; the first is at 8 p.m. and the late-night show is at 10 p.m. Tickets to the first show are $3, $2 for the late night show. As always, those who go to the earlier show can stay for the late-night show free of charge. Organizers urge the audience to arrive at 7:45 p.m. to ensure they get a seat.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>MORE MUSIC</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If The Mallards didn’t quench your thirst for live music, have no fear. Get ready for a night with Crimes New Roman (The Lipsticks), “sweaty math punk” courtesy of Pookie, alt rock, emo, pop punk from the Six Sevens and “punk/indie/whatever” from Lawn Chairs, who will be kicking off their West Coast tour this Friday. The event will run from 9 p.m. to midnight at 6769 Del Playa Dr.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>TO SPEAK FOR THE TREES</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Your Children’s Trees will be planting and maintaining a coastal oak forest at Coal Oil Point Reserve from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday. Organizers advise that interested volunteers bring water and sun protection and wear closed-toe shoes and long pants that they don’t mind getting dirty. Biking to the reserve is also recommended. Your Children’s Trees is a student-run environmental organization that hopes to improve coastal runoff and the environment of Santa Barbara by planting trees to create a healthier ecosystem.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>ROCK ‘N’ ROLL</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Need more rock ‘n’ roll in your life? Look no further: The Crash Landings and Savage Henry will be performing “tasteful and respectable” rock ‘n’ roll for alumni weekend this Saturday at 9:30 p.m. on 938 Camino Corto.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>…EVEN MORE MUSIC?</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If rock ‘n’ roll isn’t punk enough for you, fear not. Punk and metal bands RabbitFoot and Samsara will be hosting a “djentlemanly” face-off this Saturday at 991 Camino Lindo. Samsara will be going on at 9:30 p.m. to perform “earsplitting” covers of “Riptide” and “Purple Rain.” RabbitFoot will be following directly after at 10:30 p.m. for a “br00tal demonstration of speed and girth.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>MEATLESS SUNDAY</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe that corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food waste. Those interested in cooking can email organizers at <i>foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com.</i> The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77402\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/vista-point-i-v-goings-on-and-freebies-this-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77402\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/vista-point-i-v-goings-on-and-freebies-this-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/vista-point-i-v-goings-on-and-freebies-this-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/vista-point-i-v-goings-on-and-freebies-this-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/vista-point-i-v-goings-on-and-freebies-this-week/","id":4427,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4426,4425,4424],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LIVE: A.S.

She said despite being “tough” and “blunt,” her emotional involvement in many issues guided her in the advocacy for students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“When I was running, my goal was to be the person that listened, and I actually feel like I did that,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her term, Ampaw communicated with other students who did not always share her</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I was definitely forced to shut up a lot, [and] I was forced to listen,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Ampaw, her biggest accomplishment was “opening the space” of the S.A.G. to women of color.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As the first black woman in the position, I didn’t realize how big of an impact that would be and how I would be able to be a strong voice for those communities and the diaspora,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I know I could have been a much stronger voice, and I would say that’s one of my biggest regrets, but I feel like I was able to pave a way,” she added.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">When running for the position, Ampaw’s platform included increasing student awareness of the A.S. budget and creating a counselor in OSA for students accused of plagiarism.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said while she was unable to push A.S. budget transparency as much as she had wanted, she did improve the visibility of OSA finances.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Students have been able to come to me and ask me what I am doing with my money, and I am able to tell them very transparently and honestly,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said her plan to create a counselor for students accused of plagiarism was ultimately carried out by the Office of Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said prior to starting her term as S.A.G., she thought she would be “fighting alone” on behalf of students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I thought it was going to be me against A.S.,” Ampaw said. “Sometimes it was definitely me versus A.S. … but in a lot of moments, I realized that my staff had my back.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw’s staff included Catt Phan, her deputy chief of staff and a third-year global studies major. Phan said she loved working with Ampaw because she “never [lost] humor and resilience and compassion.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I have had a lot of faith in Josephine,” Phan said, “not only as a person but as someone who is in an exec position for the student government. Josephine just wants to serve the students.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Phan, the large OSA staff was “a lot to handle,” and it was oftentimes difficult to get the entire staff together for meetings. Phan said, however, the OSA office is “very sensitive” due to the types of student cases it addresses, and believes Ampaw was an experienced and qualified person to serve as S.A.G.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said she has personally changed throughout her term as S.A.G., having become more of an introvert and now finding less solace being with other people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I used to find so much rest from being around other people, but since being in this office, I find so much peace in being alone,” Ampaw said. “I thought I’d be a lot better being around other people.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said her term as S.A.G. has inspired her to become a social worker in the future. Additionally, after she graduates, Ampaw will travel to Colorado for a fellowship with AmeriCorps where she will help students who struggled in traditional school with their public speaking skills.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Looking toward next year, Ampaw said the next elected S.A.G. cannot be swayed by partisanship and must stay true to the nonpartisan nature of the office.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I also expect this person to have goals and to have aspirations for this office and really be able to express those to the entire association and entire campus,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said she is “really grateful” for the opportunity to have served as S.A.G. and wants to remind current A.S. candidates they hold an important place on campus.</p>\n<p>“For the people who are running, I would just want to say to them that the work is hard, but the work is totally worth it in the end,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77400\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77400\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/","id":3957,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3956,3955,3954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: Internal Vice President Natalie Jordan","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2017-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-27-at-3.54.24-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-27-at-3.54.24-PM.png?resize=608%2C579&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus has compiled profiles of our current elected officials to reflect on their past year in office.

Fellowship Program and changing the dynamic of the senate through the implementation of i&gt;clickers in the voting process.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said IVP is “kind of a silent, behind-the-scenes job” because the primary functions of the position are to run senate meetings, maintain the internal functions of the association and work on its own projects.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She is most proud of her work to expand the A.S. Fellowship, which allows students to become fellows to A.S. senators and executives and learn about the inner workings of the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, 100 students applied to be fellows and 66 were chosen. She added that many fellows are running for A.S. positions in this election.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is what I wanted it to be,” Jordan said. “I wanted it to be somewhere people could actually learn about the internal functions of the association before diving into a role.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her campaign for IVP, Jordan stressed her interest in working with freshmen to increase their engagement with A.S. While she does not know how to gauge the effectiveness of her efforts, Jordan said she tabled in residence halls and reached out to freshmen in the Summer Start Program and during Week of Welcome. She hopes the work she did encouraged freshmen to join A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her time as IVP, Jordan was charged with leading senate meetings, which at times could become disorderly when senators disagreed on issues or when controversial topics were discussed at public forum.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In November, the senate moved its meeting into Corwin Pavilion from its normal Flying A Room in the UCen as it planned to vote on a resolution that would allow conservative orator Ben Shapiro to speak on campus. The meeting lasted six hours, and the senate voted to approve the resolution.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, she was able to maintain a stable climate during the meeting because she established agreements and rules everyone had to adhere to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also said while public forums can cause tensions to run high and extend senate meetings, she thinks it is “really beautiful” when so many students come to voice their concerns to the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The biggest part about that is when someone comes to talk to the senators, I think as an exec or as a senator, people forget that these people are taking time out of their day-to-day schedules to come and speak,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Whatever they’re talking about is a part of their reality, so in a situation where a senate meeting goes for six hours, it’s not something people can see as something bad, but in reality more students are engaged in the issues,” she added.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nushi Yapabandara, a third-year philosophy major, ran against Jordan for IVP in the A.S. election last spring. She said she “commends” Jordan for the way she has handled the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara said she hopes next year’s IVP is “able to maintain the level of strictness and discipline and respect that Natalie has … made a standard in senate meetings.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said many unexpected projects arose during her term that were not on her campaign platform, including the creation of an A.S. orientation program, which acts as a guide to those first introduced to the association, as well as the projects that fellows in the fellowship program took on themselves.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She was most excited about the designation of an A.S. liaison from Counseling and Psychological Services to be available with students who work within A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, A.S. is a “lifestyle” and students make choices and sacrifices based on their involvement in the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A lot of students, because of how taxing it can be, were experiencing a lot of mental health stresses,” Jordan said. “And I can totally understand that; I’ve been there.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said the designated liaison has done group sessions with the senate, attends senate meetings and has been involved in the current elections by checking in with the candidates’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also reflected on the projects she hoped to do but was unable to complete, including bringing food trucks in the Arbor during finals week and using i&gt;clickers during senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, university administrations halted the plan for food trucks. She said when she realized her i&gt;clicker plan would not work, she altered the goal to eventually attain a more permanent space for senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The IVP said that at the beginning of her term, she was “so bad at delegating,” which posed a learning curve for her as she settled into IVP.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’m kind of a controlling person and I want things to go my way … because I think sometimes I understand the greater picture, and it’s very naive of me to think that and I realize that,” Jordan said. “Sometimes I realize that instead of controlling a situation, it’s better to let others take a shot at it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara, who worked as Jordan’s director of programming during Fall Quarter, said she recognized Jordan’s struggle to give other staff members tasks as she “gunned through” and tried to do everything herself.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Yapabandara, this hindered Jordan’s ability to complete all the projects she wanted to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like she could have been a lot more transparent and accessible to everyone,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said that after her time as IVP, she has realized that the position is “experiential learning.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“No matter how much preparation you’ve had before or experience with this community, there’s really no way to learn how to manage an association of over 800 students overnight,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, the next elected IVP needs to focus on preserving a stable environment at senate meetings. She attributes her ability to handle the senate to the fact that she was an independent executive and “never had to play any games with anyone.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think the next IVP needs to make sure they’re maintaining an unbiased viewpoint and also [make] sure that they’re really checking in with everyone and maintaining a really positive climate,” Jordan said. “You can only do so much, but trying at least matters.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As her time as IVP comes to an end and A.S. election season is almost over, Jordan said she loved the chance to be a “change-maker” in the association and now understands more about herself and her capabilities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sleep is way overrated,” Jordan said. “Four hours a night is the slumber of champions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said after her term is complete, she will continue her position as vice president of the Isla Vista Community Service District as well as her full-time job as the senior event coordinator at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77393\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77393\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/","id":3955,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3954,3953,3952],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: A.S.

Senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In April 2016, the two senators reached out to Lyft, a rideshare app that allows users to hail a taxi on demand, and were able to secure a partnership with the company. A month later, A.S. Senate passed a resolution to allocate $40,000 to the alternative transportation program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Applications opened for the first time in September to enroll 20 disabled students for free Lyft rides between home and campus. Hechler’s office named the program “Gaucho Rides.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The pilot program shut down in the third week of Winter Quarter, and the <i>Nexus</i> is currently verifying the causal factors. Meanwhile, Hechler said his office is developing a “backup plan” in which students can receive rides without the use of codes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Office of the A.S. President will most likely re-launch Gaucho Rides later this week, Hechler said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> in September that, depending on how the program ran in the next two quarters, he and other advocates would consider pushing for a lock-in fee for it. This week’s A.S. Elections ballot does not include such a measure.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s next platform item — sexual assault reform — has resurfaced intermittently throughout his political career.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The issue arose in April 2015 during an A.S. candidate forum when Hechler was running for a seat on A.S. Senate. An anonymous audience member asked the candidates how they plan to address campus sexual assault, and Hechler answered in response that he intended to extend sexual assault prevention training to the Greek community.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like the Greek community is such a strong and compassionate group that will rally around anything,” he said in 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler incorporated the same policy into his platform when running for president last year, calling it “one of the bigger parts of [his] platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said on Monday that this year, he spearheaded a campaign to have fraternities and sororities learn how to prevent sexual assault through the Green Dot Bystander Intervention Program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The program was funded by Hechler’s office and solicited approximately 120 men and women from IFC and the Collegiate Panhellenic Council (CPC).</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alejandra Melgoza, who vied against Hechler in 2016, said she is yet to see Hechler involved in any of the monthly conversations with university administration concerning sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also said Hechler has not yet released a statement about Sexual Assault Awareness Month or attended any events hosted by Take Back the Night, a student group dedicated to preventing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As President, he was also unable to keep his own senators who ran on a platform of sexual assault accountable,” Melgoza said in an email. “Sexual assault is not an issue that can be put on a platform to earn political capital. It affects many students personally, including myself.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said he has often sent representatives from his office to various meetings addressing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also promised in April 2016 to lead the push in A.S. for a CSD in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He and Ashcon Minoiefar, the A.S. external vice president of local affairs, worked closely together to gather volunteers for Yes on E&amp;F, a campaign which sought to establish the CSD through Measure E and fund the CSD with a special tax through Measure F.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As it turns out, voters in November overwhelmingly approved Measure E, thus creating the CSD, but did not pass Measure F, taking away the CSD’s main funding source.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fourth and final part of Hechler’s presidential campaign platform was to provide to students the least expensive course reader materials through a partnership with A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It was, like, a long process because at first we didn’t how to do it,” he said on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s office began work on this plan early on, sending out emails en masse to every professor at the university. The emails asked that faculty primarily use A.S. Publications instead of Alternative Digital Printing, the private printing business in the UCen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">His office later opted to contact academic department heads instead. He said some departments, such as the political science and environmental studies departments, responded positively. Others did not reply at all, he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The goal at the end of the day was to create a bank through Pubs where, I guess, professors could upload their things and students wouldn’t even have to buy it. It would just be on the internet; you know, environmentally friendly,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said David Miller, the A.S. Publications staff member who died in March, told him that his office more than doubled the amount of course readers published through A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The plan to increase student use of A.S. Publications “died out,” Hechler said, after Miller passed away.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also took up a few other projects outside of his platform items, including an initiative to expand the A.S. Food Bank and a push to give priority registration to ROTC students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Breanna Jones, the A.S. Food Bank committee chair, told the <i>Nexus</i> in early April that Hechler advocated strongly to university administration for the expansion of the A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[He] really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened,” she said in April.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Senate passed a bill earlier this month to give priority registration to ROTC students, and the resolution now awaits approval from the Academic Senate. Senator Alex Giolito, who introduced the bill alongside senator Riley Hobson, said two weeks ago that Hechler “brought this all together by reaching out to ROTC students first.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This year I’ve really tried to hold the senators accountable in ways that I never thought I would have to,” Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Melgoza said she found Hechler’s platform items to be “inherently hollow” and “lacked substance,” saying he had “no personal connection to anything on his platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She added that she never viewed Hechler as “someone with conviction” when they both served on A.S. Senate, and she said her views have not changed since.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There were other senators who I definitely disagreed with at the table but I still admired their dedication to their beliefs,” Melgoza said in an email. “Hechler on the other hand was constantly passive.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Arielle Kronovet, Hechler’s chief of staff, said Hechler’s kindness can often be mistaken for passivity and that he is actually “firm to his beliefs.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“He’s serious about leaving this school a better place, and I’ve seen him doing this throughout the year,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Talia Stringfellow, the A.S. president’s deputy chief of staff, said she found Hechler to be more decisive and communicative than his predecessor Villarreal, whom she worked for as an A.S. fellow the year before.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sometimes [Villarreal] changed his mind and was not a big communicator,” she said. “Communication has been a huge, sweet [and] influential part of why I think Austin’s such a good president.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler will finish his term in the next few weeks, handing the presidency to whomever students elect Thursday night. In the meantime, Hechler said, he is applying for jobs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s funny because I bet everyone thinks, ‘Oh you have a nice title; you’re going to find a job easily.’ It’s not that easy. It’s really not,” he said. “Honestly I had no idea you had to apply to jobs so early.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler looks to receive his degree in political science in June. Wherever he ends up in the next few years, he said, he wants to continue in public service.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I really just want to give back to communities,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been so privileged to have so many great opportunities in my life, and I want to give that back to people wherever I am.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/","id":3953,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3952,3951,3950],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":76,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
