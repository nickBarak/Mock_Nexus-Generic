Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers and organizers spoke out against some of the Indian government’s practices, such as the lockdown of the region of Kashmir, the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and violence against people protesting these acts, actions which they deemed representative of “state-sponsored facism,” according to the event’s Facebook page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event drew over 100 attendees and featured chants led by graduate student and organizer Pratik Raghu</span><b>, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speeches from students and faculty members, a recitation of a revolutionary Urdu poem by organizer and first-year graduate student Tannishtha Bhattacharjee and a strategizing session to discuss ways in which people can support the protests in India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was organized by Raghu, Bhattacharjee, third-year English graduate student Somak Mukherjee, graduate student Surojit Kayal and first-year film and media studies graduate student Pujita, who asked to be referred to by her first name due to privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the teach-in, third-year College of Creative Studies biology major and speaker Salman Sadakkadulla from the UCSB Muslim Student Association criticized the process required to prove citizenship under the NRC, which declared 1.9 million applicants from the northeastern state of Assam </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> many of whom are Muslims and Bengali Hindus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to be stateless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Imagine waking up tomorrow, in I.V.,” Sadakkadulla said. “Imagine waking up without carrying your wallet. Imagine being stopped by [the] I.V. Foot Patrol and being asked to show your birth certificate. You don’t have that? Well, do you have your Social Security card? No? Well, if you don’t have that, do you have your driver’s license? No, you forgot it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants also handed out informational documents, stating that the CAA, which passed in December 2019, “when combined with the NRC, could lead to Indian Muslims, transgender people, adivasis, poor people, dalits, women, those not having land — everyone without documents — being declared stateless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CAA provides a path to citizenship for undocumented Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian refugees escaping religious persecution in countries neighboring India. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opponents to the act argue that it does not give eligibility to Muslims nor religious minorities from all countries that neighbor India, such as Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Christian Tamils from Sri Lanka, according to the Economic Times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pujita, the initial organizer for the teach-in, said in an interview that detention centers built for stateless people in Assam share similarities with migrant detention centers in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The United States of America and Trump and Modi are constantly built on their politics of illegal immigration,” Pujita said. “Words like ‘border patrol,’ ‘detention camps,’ ‘the wall’ — these words that move around here are similar concepts and similar words that are being mobilized [in India] as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the chants from the teach-in elaborated on that comparison: “From Assam to El Paso, detention camps have got to go.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pujita was initially mobilized to put on the teach-in after the attacks on </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_University,_Delhi\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jawaharlal Nehru University</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (JNU) in New Delhi on Jan. 5, in which 50 masked people, later identified as members of the right-wing Hindu Raksha Dal, beat students and faculty with iron rods and acid bottles, vandalizing property and “specifically targeting Muslim and Kashmiri students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It was] an act of unprecedented terror that happened on campus,” Pujita said. “I spent six years there and all my political upbringing has been [from there], and I endow all my life and existence to that campus. So that was at once feeling helpless, being away, but also wanting to do things here and tell people what’s going on back home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers from the teach-in drew parallels between the situation in India and authoritarianism across the world. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92462\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"165692605\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92485\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92462\" data-attachment-id=\"92462\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/graduate-students-hold-teach-in-at-storke-tower-to-protest-indian-prime-minister-modis-administration/india-protest_kaiyi-yang_online_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"India Protest_Kaiyi Yang_ONLINE_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-92462\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The teach-in at UCSB was an urgent call-to-action for people to care about “these oppressed millions who have taken to the streets” in India. </span><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year English major Rachel Andrews, a student speaker from UCSB’s Students for Justice in Palestine, compared the military occupation of the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir  to the occupation of Palestine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kashmir is considered the most militarized zone in the world. Excessive force is used by the army, even on children, and there are extreme restrictions,” Andrews said. “For example, Kashmir has a curfew, and in a similar way, Palestinians are not able to move freely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Article 370, which granted semi-autonomous status to Kashmir and Jammu, a Hindu-majority state, was revoked in August 2019, subjecting the two states to greater Indian influence and control. Following the revocation, the Indian government stationed tens of thousands of troops in Kashmir, suspended telecommunications and banned public movements, according to CNBC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year global studies and philosophy major Alia Reynolds, another student speaker from UCSB’s Students for Justice in Palestine, warned that the same pattern of “danger, hatred and persecution” will continue to spread across the world and the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we do not engage in the advocacy, policy, prevention, restructurement and revolution that is available to us now, we will fall into the same pattern,” Reynolds stressed. “If we do not fight for the rights and lives of those around the world who are currently being denied those rights or tortured or killed for fighting for them, who will fight for us when our time comes?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers expressed hope through the multidimensional student movement emerging out of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s exertion of authoritarian power. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bishnupriya Ghosh, chair of the global studies department, expressed hope for the college students across India that have been launching protests at their universities, most recently after the passage of the CAA in December, and fighting to reestablish India as a secular, democratic republic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As the attacks on the universities have continued, [at] many universities, there’s been a broad coalition, visibly between Muslims, between Dalits [and] between women and students,” Ghosh said in her speech. “It’s a coalition which is extraordinary because it goes across ethnic and linguistic grounds, religious borders, castes and generations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Raghu, the teach-in at UCSB was an urgent call-to-action for people to care about “these oppressed millions who have taken to the streets” in India. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve felt a keen sense of desperation over the past few weeks … over the past few years, really, as authoritarianism has gained momentum in India,” Raghu said. “And I’ve tried to use that sense of desperation to bring others into the struggle.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yang in 1998. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1998 demands called for the establishment of an LGBTQ+ resource center as well as a building in which to house the newly created organization and were meant to address the needs of LGBTQ+ students and provide more services and education, in addition to a space on campus for LGBTQ+ students. These demands ultimately resulted in the creation of the RCSGD in October 1999.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017 demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> called for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to be separate from the jurisdiction of the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department (WGSE) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stating that their umbrella organization did not treat them fairly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the RCSGD’s programming budget to be doubled and for the designation of a freestanding building for the RCSGD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the demands called for a proper investigation into the circumstances surrounding Muro’s termination; the RCSGD and the WGSE disagreed about the extent of police presence during Muro’s firing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately, the RCSGD was removed from underneath the umbrella of the WGSE, and its programming budget was doubled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwayne Mosbey, the programming coordinator of the RCSGD, said the center has seen an almost sixfold increase in growth between Spring 2019 and Fall 2019. In addition, event attendance has doubled in the same timeframe across 72 programs, which he pointed to as a sign of the program’s expansion.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey also discussed the RCSGD’s work in expanding its reach through collaborations with 22 various services and organizations, including Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), C</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ampus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) and the MultiCultural Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What this implies is that our center now has connections all throughout campus. So for students who find some of these services that are inaccessible on their own, we’re able to connect them with those resources,” Mosbey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now two years later, with the majority of the 2017 demands met by the university, the largest and most costly demand is the last one left: the designation of a free-standing building for the RCSGD, which is currently housed in the Student Resource Building (SRB).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This was one demand put on the list that we discussed with students at the time was going to take a while and [there] would be a much longer process [to it] than the other ones,” said Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion centered around how the RCSGD could go about either repurposing a building on campus, constructing a new building, creating multiple centers in various places in order to spread services across campus or even designate a location outside the bounds of the university in order to better serve members of the wider Goleta and Santa Barbara community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead suggested constructing a building to serve the aggregate needs of several organizations on campus. The Black Student Union has been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calling for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a freestanding center for Black students on campus for over 50 years; in March 2019, Yang agreed to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the creation of the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/inaugural-director-of-the-office-of-black-student-development-hired-fulfilling-bsu-demand/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of Black Student Development</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and to make the standalone building a priority in campus planning efforts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have several groups, like the Office of Black Student Development, the Monarch Lounge; we’d like them to have some really nice space and then [it’d] probably be more cost effective to have another SRB for these groups.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead also discussed the possibility of establishing a location off-campus to serve as the RCSGD building, as well as potentially partnering with the Pacific Pride Foundation, an organization that provides “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provides services to the HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ+ communities of Santa Barbara County,” according to its </span><a href=\"https://pacificpridefoundation.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leets, the RCSGD director, said the center could also establish temporary spaces on campus, which could be used by the RCSGD to provide better accessibility to students living in the Chi-5 residence halls and the eastern ends of campus, near the engineering building, for example. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know when I first got here, we had been talking about Isla Vista as where we needed more space, but I’ve noticed that here we seem to have some claim on this side of campus [near the SRB]. But I wonder about the middle of campus where Chi-5 is, and then the other side of campus,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, where the engineering buildings are, I went there for the first time this summer. So like a year into my job here, I had never been over to that side of campus. I think we’re trying to think about how we can have temporary space in those places.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexia Duran, a second-year undeclared student, suggested that the RCSGD allow students to have 24/7 access to the center “just for it to be a more accessible space for students,” citing the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“El Centro is open 24/7 and I’ve been there at 3 a.m. and I see people… [who] don’t have a house and students sometimes have to sleep on the couch. Having a space that would provide that for LGBTQ people would be necessary,” Duran said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said the RCSGD could also be moved into a number of soon-to-be-vacated sites closer to the center of campus, allowing for greater accessibility and interconnectedness with the Chi-5 dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a couple years down the road, but the university is in the process of moving some of the offices that are in the center of campus, and don’t need to be on the center of campus, off-campus. And that’s going to create some more space,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, several attendees objected to that idea, arguing that the buildings in that portion of campus were both old and in an undesirable state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You look at the Monarch Lounge, like it’s a pretty poor excuse for how we serve undocumented students. It’s a glorified portable, and relocating the RCSGD towards the center of campus will be probably within that space,” said Esmeralda Quintero, a third-year political science and sociology double major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said that feasibility will be considered in the decision, but that support from students will be the deciding factor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not moving the RCSGD at all without student support,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we have an exact plan? No. However, things are moving because of new development that’s happening. And so starting to identify our needs now will serve us well so that we can slide in and start moving towards a space that is going to be open in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The program’s goal is to attract diverse students of all areas of study. Students will graduate and work two to five years in their respective field and will return to UC Berkeley to complete their MBA. The Accelerated Access program estimates that it will enroll roughly 15 students a year. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCLA: Parent to plead guilty for involvement in admissions scandal at UCLA (<em><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/29/parent-to-plead-guilty-for-involvement-in-admissions-scandal/\">Daily Bruin</a>)</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xiaoning Sui, a parent who allegedly paid William Singer — the ringleader of the college admissions scandal — in order for her son to be admitted to UC Los Angeles as a soccer recruit, accepted a plea deal on Wednesday and is expected to plead guilty to federal program robbery. Upon her arrest in September, Sui was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud. After receiving $400,000 from Sui, Singer then paid UCLA men’s soccer coach Jorge Salcedo $100,000 to list her son as a soccer recruit, who was later admitted to the school on an athletic scholarship. </span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz: UCSC misses 2020 zero waste goal (<em><a href=\"https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/01/24/ucsc-misses-2020-zero-waste-goal/\">City on a Hill Press</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under a shared goal throughout the UC system to recycle or compost 90% of all solid waste at each UC campus by 2020, UC Santa Cruz reported that it missed that goal by 40% this year, as the university managed to only divert just over half its solid waste by the beginning of the new year.

The committee has also held forums at UC Davis and UC Los Angeles, as well as meetings with UC union leaders and UC health officials. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students, staff and faculty took to the floor to share the characteristics they are looking for in a president, along with policies they hope the new president will implement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next president needs to be an ally for immigrant students and underrepresented students of color,” Valerie Johnson, a representative from the UC Student Association, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students at the town hall were also vocal about their desires for the incoming president to focus on campus sustainability policies, including the possibility of creating a UC Green New Deal to address climate change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have an institutional responsibility to act collectively and use our resources to reduce harm and bring about sustainability and justice in our UC communities,” Sarah Bancroft, a third-year student at UC Berkeley, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley faculty and staff were also present to voice their concerns to the committee on a number of issues, including food insecurity, affordable housing and diversity and resource allocation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As staff, we’re really concerned about the issues of equity and inclusion that this new president would bring,” Brian Light, a delegate from Council of UC Staff Assemblies, said. “We’d love to see if a new president could champion some ideas to help the complexities that staff are increasingly seeing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berkeley faculty held their own town hall last November to discuss ideas to bring to the Special Committee. Michael Burawoy, a sociology professor at UC Berkeley, reported that staff wanted a president who interacted more with students, staff and faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to emphasize the importance of the new president understanding the actual campuses, and the relationships between the administration, the Senate faculty, lecturers, challenges graduate students face and the implications all this has for undergraduates,” Burawoy said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, the Special Committee will spend the next four months reviewing potential candidates and communicating with students and faculty from UC campuses. The Special Committee’s candidate recommendation for the presidential seat is expected in May.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299 (AFSCME 3299) patient care and service workers have been without a contract for just under two years — reaching an agreement with the UC is a “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">testament to our members’ commitment,” AFSCME President Kathryn Lybarger said in a press release sent out by the union. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This has been a long and hard process that required both sides to seek common ground and work in good faith,” Lybarger said. “But it has brought important issues to light about the growing problem of income inequality, the fight for what’s left of America’s middle class and how large public institutions can uplift the communities they serve.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC similarly welcomed an agreement with the union. The contracts were “achieved through the hard work and good faith efforts of the AFSCME and UC negotiating teams,” UC Board of Regents Chair John A. Pérez said in a press release sent out Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the contracts “provide hardworking UC employees with the benefits and protections they deserve, and it moves UC closer to being the kind of employer we need to be.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The terms of the contract for patient care workers include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 6% across the board increase plus an experience-based increase; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A one-time $500 payment to per diem and limited employees who worked at least 400 hours in 2019; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual 3% across-the-board increases between 2021 and 2024;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual 2% experience-based increases between 2020 and 2024; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A one-time payment of $3,000 for all eligible full-time employees; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second one-time payment of $1,000 for all eligible full-time employees in 2021; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A one-time payment of $1,000 for employees who have or will achieve 20 years of service for the UC while the contract is active. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contract, along with directing that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new employees receive the same pension benefits as current AFSCME-represented employees,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also continues to prohibit layoffs as “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a result of subcontracting decisions and creates career employment opportunities at UC by placing additional restrictions on UC’s ability to contract out service unit work.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The road to coming to an agreement was not smooth — AFSCME workers went on strike several times during the contract negotiations, most recently in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/ucs-largest-union-strikes-for-the-third-time-this-year/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">November 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over alleged unfair labor practices.

This set number of swipes expires at the end of each week and cannot be used for the weeks following. In Ferguson and Mitchell’s resolution, the two argue that meal swipes should expire at the end of each quarter, rather than each week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal, as detailed in the resolution, would allow meal swipes to be used throughout the quarter rather than expire each Sunday after dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In order to make full use of student meal plans, there needs to be amendments to how meal plan swipes can be used, by whom, and when they expire,” the resolution reads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states that students with 17 meal swipes per week or fewer should be able to swipe guests into the dining commons with their own meal swipes, rather than be charged a $12 fee for each guest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the UCSB Housing </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/dining/offcampus-mealplan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a standard 14 meals per week costs $1,532 per quarter. Students who choose to live in the dorms are mandated to buy a meal plan, the cost of which is added in with their housing expenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a lower-income, first-generation, queer college student, I understand the struggles of not knowing when your next meal may come sometimes. I couldn’t afford a meal plan this year because of how expensive they are,” Ferguson said in Wednesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution supports several other modifications to the current meal plan rules, namely removing the cap on how many meals students may donate to the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank each week, which is currently at a maximum of three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the resolution, the A.S. Food Bank had already been working with Executive Director of Campus Dining Jill Horst to try to implement a policy to allow students to donate more of their meal swipes per week, according to Eric Nava, the Food Bank’s student coordinator and fourth-year religious studies major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been working with Jill to try to raise this cap for about three years now and the process has been very stagnant,” Nava said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nava said the A.S. Food Bank staff supports the resolution and is hopeful that the added support of the Senate position can help them meet their goals in raising or abolishing the current donation cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The issue isn’t just about accessibility, but also about waste, specifically a waste of money. When something is paid for, it should remain in the system and be reused for students who need those swipes,” said Soha Sadeghinejad, the student sponsor of the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this isn’t the first time meal rollovers have been discussed. Ferguson referred to similar demands made in 2006, when a survey showing support for meal rollover was presented to the UCSB Dining Services director, the Housing &amp; Residential Services executive director and the Residential Housing Association president, citing a previous </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2006-04-04/survey-results-heat-up-debate-over-possible-meal-rollover-system/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> article.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In 2006, On-Campus Senator Nathaniel Wood-Wilde presented a survey to RHA showing that a majority of students supported a meal swipe rollover policy. The RHA were ‘considering the implementation of rollovers in student meal plans’ and were ‘definitely interested to see what works best for students,’” Ferguson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Food insecurity is no joke; it’s a big issue on college campuses, and this resolution is another step in the right direction. Students desperately want change, and through advocacy and support we can make that change a reality,” Sadeghinejad said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 28, 5:23 p.m.] </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/","id":3368,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[3367,3366,3365],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No Reported Cases of Coronavirus on Campus, Student Health Says","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The email comes after several UCSB students posted on the UCSB subreddit, r/UCSantaBarbara, late Sunday night with rumors about the virus.

roughly 200 students gathered under Storke Tower at 8 p.m. to mourn the loss of Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News of Bryant’s death sent ripples of emotion throughout the United States and the rest of the world. An icon to many, fans paid tribute to Bryant and his legacy by holding vigils all over the world, but most prominently at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, home to Bryant’s 20-year tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers, The New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/kobe-bryant-la-california.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Santa Barbara, about an hour and a half away from the crash site, an outpour of roughly 200 students gathered under Storke Tower at 8 p.m. to mourn the loss of Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university was also home to Bryant’s basketball camp, the </span><a href=\"http://www.youth-basketball-camps.com/camps/kobe-bryant-basketball-camp/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kobe Basketball Academy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which ran for eight years at the Thunderdome and was designed to help kids hone their basketball skills, </span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/kobe_bryant_impact_inspiration_santa_barbara_county_basketball_20200126\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noozhawk reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the center of the vigil rested a picture of Bryant and his daughter, a bouquet of flowers and a poster inscribed “RIP #24 MAMBA.” Bryant’s numbers — 8 and 24 — glimmered off the jerseys of students facing the candlelight, while shades of purple and gold draped the crowd from the many who sported Lakers attire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously, if you came out, Kobe meant a lot to you,” Nasrat Hamid, a fourth-year chemistry major and the event’s organizer, said to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s kind of crazy how someone I’m sure most of us have never met before had such a huge impact on our lives. It’s kind of silly when you think about it — I’ve never met this guy but here I am crying my eyes out because he just passed away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid organized the event earlier that same day after emailing Chancellor Henry T. Yang for permission to hold the vigil, and Yang helped provide Hamid with microphones for the event. After getting permission, Hamid’s sister, Nishat Hamid, said they used social media to let students know an event in Bryant’s honor would be taking place that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid spoke to the crowd first, leaving the microphone open for students who wanted to share their favorite memories about Bryant, the impact he had on their lives and what they’ll remember most about him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As students spoke through the tears, those in the crowd banded together, arms wrapped around one another as they mourned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student who took the mic saw Bryant’s death as an opportunity to look back and resolve the negativities in life that weren’t worth the frustration they caused. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you have any conflict with anyone, maybe just resolve it and say ‘I love you,’ even in  a friendly way. It’s what Kobe would have wanted,” the student said. “I love that man, and even though I don’t know anyone here, I love you all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just keep powering through [your] own lives and look around and love those near [you] because we are not guaranteed a tomorrow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the minutes leading up to the moment of silence at 8:24 p.m. — to honor both of Bryant’s jersey numbers — one student put his phone next to the microphone to play Lil Wayne’s “Kobe Bryant” after asking the crowd if they’d like to hear the song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few minutes of silence, students resumed speaking to the crowd as others began to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student recalled how an introduction to basketball — and later, a passion for it — came from Bryant, who inspired them to pick up a ball after watching him on television. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m having fun. Kobe taught me how to love the game,” the student said. “I have this Kobe poster in my room and now I can’t look at it all that much anymore, just because it hurts that much.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never got to watch Kobe live, I never got to meet him in person,” the student added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, I will never get the chance to.”</span></p>\n<p>[<em>Correction Jan. 28, 8:33 a.m.]: In a previous version of this article, Nishat Hamid’s name was misspelled.

The bill will require a two-thirds vote from the student body during the upcoming spring elections to be implemented; if it passes, the seats will be added to the 72nd Senate for the 2021-2022 school year, not the incoming 71st Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, the bill was written with the intention of replacing one off-campus senator seat with one international student seat to ensure Associated Students (A.S.) Senate remained at an odd number. Keeping the Senate at even numbers would give the internal vice president a significant amount of power if a tie-breaking vote was held, a concern that both Ferguson and Swanson expressed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the bill was amended during the Senate’s Jan. 22 meeting to increase the number of international student senator seats from one to two, instead of removing an off-campus senator seat.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Based off of the statistics I was hearing, I didn’t understand why we were only adding one senator and decreasing representation for other students,” Kimia Hadidi, the off-campus senator who proposed amending the bill, said during the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was amended and passed after a lengthy discussion in which some senators, such as On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman, expressed concern over the potential decrease in off-campus senators. He further discussed how the bill could possibly open the doors to other groups on campus asking for Senate seats designated specifically for them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus after the meeting, Foreman expressed worry that “the Flying A Room can only fit so many people,” and that if more seats were to be added, the Senate should find a way to restructure itself as to ensure that it can still logistically function with a larger governing body.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the Senate is composed of: five on-campus senator seats, 12 off-campus senator seats, six representatives at large, one university-owned housing representative and a transfer student senator.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant amount of support for the bill came from international student groups, such as the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA). According to the UCSB 2018-19 campus profile, 12% of all UCSB undergraduates are international students, and 73% of international students at UCSB are from China. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All UCSB undergraduates, including international students, pay student fees which go toward funding for entities such as A.S. For the 2018-19 school year, UCSB undergraduates each paid </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/cost-of-attendance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,854</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in these student fees, according to the UCSB Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships; in the same school year, the A.S. Senate received just under </span><a href=\"https://budget.as.ucsb.edu/files/2018/05/budget18-19.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$12.5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> million in student fees. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Creating an international student senator [seat] can definitely allow us to have a say in how the money is distributed and make sure that our money is used well and fairly,” Hanrui Feng, vice president of the CSSA, said during the meeting.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An international student has never sat on the A.S. Senate at UCSB, but the bill notes that other UCs, such as UC Los Angeles and UC San Diego, have “equivalent” roles for international students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My hope is that this will contribute to expanding crucial opportunities for international students in A.S.,” said Charles Neumann, the internal chair of the A.S. Global Gaucho Commission and one of the bill’s 20 student sponsors. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann added that he considers an international student senator crucial to “breaking down social barriers between international students and domestics, and a path forward in addressing these previously overlooked crucial interests.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

policies. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion around Title IX — a federal law banning discrimination on the basis of sex in federally-funded educational institutes — focused on cases of sexual misconduct and violence on UC campuses and what the UC Title IX offices have done to address the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After reviewing what the UC Title IX office has done over the past six years, a panel of individuals working in the UC Systemwide Title IX department and on specific campuses took questions from the UC Regents.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Student complaints have increased significantly since we put the [Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment] policy in place in 2016, and [the state auditor] connected that increase to better training and student outreach and improved reporting processes,” said Suzanne Taylor, the UC systemwide Title IX director.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This increase in reports is really an encouraging reflection,” she added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight:

400;\">policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the UC’s rule system regarding cases of sexual misconduct and defines what is considered sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the roughly 30-minute presentation and discussion, the topic of “innocent until proven guilty” was brought up by Chair of the Universitywide Academic Senate Kum-Kum Bhavnani. The UC Regents are currently being </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-05/former-uc-graduate-student-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-regents-claiming-lack-of-due-process-in-title-ix-proceedings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sued</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a class action lawsuit by plaintiffs who allege their due process rights were violated by the university during investigations into allegations of sexual misconduct against them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara has faced at least three Title IX lawsuits in which the judge sided with the student in their appeal against the university’s decision to either suspend orexpel the student following alleged Title IX violations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucsb-student-exonerated-from-relationship-violence-charges-after-629-days/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exonerated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and his suspension was reversed after 629 days in October 2018; in another</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/sb-superior-court-reverses-ucsb-students-suspension-for-sexual-assault/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which UCSB lost also in October 2018, the judge called the case “noticeably absent [of] even a semblance of due process.” In a third case in August 2018, UCSB was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held in contempt of court</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the expelled student was allowed to return to UCSB.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the discussion, Bhavnani questioned how the rights of the accused are balanced within a larger context of “moral panic over sexual violence.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our question is whether someone violated our policy and that’s different from a criminal inquiry,” Taylor responded to Bhavnani. “We have a process that allows for a thorough, neutral and impartial investigation.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. Department of Education is considering rolling back some of the previous administration’s rules regarding how universities address sexual misconduct allegations — such as narrowing the definition of sexual assault and allowing universities to operate on a preponderance of evidence standard or a “clear and convincing” evidence standard — a move which UC President Janet Napolitano denounced in a Washington Post </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/janet-napolitano-dont-let-the-trump-administration-undermine-title-ix/2018/12/04/6c91f316-f7fc-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">op-ed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December 2018.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel of Title IX officials repeatedly called for additional funding over the duration of the discussion.

Rock the Vote SB initially “wholeheartedly attempted to work with them to bring our operation into compliance,” he said, but was asked by the national organization in December to “drop our affiliation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB then “immediately ceased operation[s],” Howe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe added that the Student Activist Network’s allegations –– which included that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote in I.V. by encouraging online voter registration, telling people their car insurance would go up if they voted in Isla Vista and that the group encouraged people to vote at home instead of in I.V. ––  were “misleading and unverified.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations of voter suppression not only relate to Rock the Vote but also alleged ties to Bruce Porter, a candidate running for the third district seat in the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors March election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said that in August 2019, he responded to a post on the Rock the Vote SB website that stated the group was hiring. He then was “introduced to and met briefly with Bruce Porter,” who “mentioned his intention was to create a non-partisan voter registration group in Isla Vista.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a letter Porter sent to his supporters on Jan. 15, which was obtained by the Nexus, Porter discussed Rock the Vote’s alleged intent to cause low voter turnout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Congressman Salud] Carbajal and [Supervisor Joann] Hartmann went all out to crush the nonpartisan voter registration effort in Isla Vista and shotgun accusations of voter suppression,” Porter wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, Rock the Vote has done a fabulous job of providing truthful and objective voter registration education to students. The result: far more students chose to register back home and there are 1400 fewer students registered to vote in IV this year, compared to this point in 2016, even though the student population has significantly increased.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe told his staff in an email sent on Jan. 15 that operations were “on hold for the moment” due to “local political issues.” Howe told them in the email to refrain from wearing their T-shirts and doing any branding and to delete all social media accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers were left without a clear reason why all operations had ended out of nowhere as Howe instructed staff to tell current and potential volunteers “the schedule is full and no more volunteers are needed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple Rock the Vote SB volunteers spoke to the Nexus, saying they had no idea that the organization was illegitimate until this week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a post on Free and For Sale that was basically just trashing Rock the Vote for all these allegations,” said Sean Price, a first-year pre-biology major. “At first I didn’t believe it, but then I found out that the website was gone, Facebook was gone; I haven’t checked their Instagram, but I’m sure that’s gone too. I didn’t hear anything from them when this all happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second-year volunteer, who asked not to be named, said that they tried to reach out about changing their shift day for winter quarter and never heard back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I did get was an email about there’s been stuff going on this week with tabling. So I had no idea basically what was going on until I read an article on Facebook about that it could potentially be a fraudulent organization … they stopped tabling, and then just nothing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Student Activist Network raised three separate allegations against Rock the Vote SB accusing them of voter suppression in Isla Vista. The group alleges that Rock the Vote gave out voter registration cards at the Arbor instead of filling out physical forms, that they told people their car insurance costs would increase if they registered to vote in I.V. and that they encouraged people to vote at their home addresses in other parts of the state instead of in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers who spoke to the Nexus confirmed that official registration forms were “rarely” provided for tabling in favor of voter registration cards that directed people to the Rock the Vote SB website, which has since been shut down, to register to vote on their own time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the eyes of the Student Activist Network, handing out cards makes it less likely for students to register to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have tabled many times at the Arbor and I know that students are often walking by very, very quickly. They often take things that are handed to them and then immediately throw them away,” Brennan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best way to actually get somebody signed up to vote is to actually ask them to come over to your table and fill out the form. That is the only way that you could actually guarantee that the people who you have actually gotten to bring over to your booth are actually going to follow through … We only complicate the process when we ask people to go online to fill out forms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said in a statement that Rock the Vote SB encouraged online registration but “ALWAYS carried hardcopies of voter registration cards for those who preferred that method which we found to be rare because Gen Z generally is a digital culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One second-year volunteer, who requested their name not be used, said they were confused about why voter registration forms were not the norm but didn’t deeply question the practice because they believed Rock the Vote SB to be a legitimate organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel really frustrated because in retrospect looking back, things were sort of red flags,” they said. They added that they were made familiar with the organization through a UCSB honors mail listserv. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just never assumed that through an honors mail listserv that an actual, illegitimate thing could be presented to us students,” they said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another allegation raised by the Student Activist Network was that Rock the Vote SB told students that their car insurance rates would go up if they registered to vote in I.V., which they heard from multiple students who Rock the Vote SB volunteers had spoken with, but Howe rejected that claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have never heard of the concept of car insurance rates getting raised nor did anything remotely close to that ever get discussed with my team,” Howe said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This claim is the most bizarre of them all. It is so obviously unbelievable it waves a red </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flag as to how low the people spreading these dishonest statements will go for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their own political gain.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No volunteers that the Nexus spoke with had ever heard of discussions about car insurance rates increasing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final issue raised by the Student Activist Network is that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“dissuading people from registering in IV on the grounds that other elections in the Bay, LA, and San Diego are more contested,” according to its Facebook post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the backside of the Rock the Vote SB online voting card obtained by the Nexus, the card reads that “It’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Choice Where to Register,” whether that be at home or school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The card’s wording did not raise alarms for Price until this past week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are three places on the card: Los Angeles, San Diego and Bay Area issues, but nothing in Santa Barbara, like no reason to vote in Santa Barbara, and then there’s websites to each place about those issues,” Price said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It basically just said vote where you think your opinion matters more, like where you’ll make a difference, which is basically what I told people and what I thought was being advertised by them, but now I’ve heard that it’s not.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no further information from Howe or Rock the Vote SB in general, student volunteers for Rock the Vote SB have been left confused about where the organization stands and remain frustrated by new information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything looked very legit and no interactions that I had with anyone were bad. They were all just pretty straightforward. I was just to get my volunteer hours, so that’s really frustrating for someone who was trying to have volunteers actually make a difference and register people to vote and that’s important to me,” one volunteer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t help beating myself up, like why didn’t I, like, think this was a bigger issue at the time?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I’m waiting for more information to come to light because I feel very taken advantage of,” Price said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I figured I was doing something to help voter registration and improve community involvement. And if that’s the opposite of what was happening, then that’s the exact opposite of why I joined this.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Tower to the Arbor. <em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students are informally calling for a similar cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), although advocacy group UCSB 4 COLA stressed that Wednesday’s action was just the first step in a larger COLA movement and not a formal strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students at UCSC have been on strike since Dec. 9, 2019 and have been calling for a COLA of $1,412 per month </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/campaign-timeline/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since September</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The “sick-out” on Wednesday was planned to coincide with a UC Regents meeting, in which the UCSC strikers planned to address the UC Office of the President directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Wednesday demonstration focused on the parallels between the challenges faced by UCSB and UCSC graduate students, such as steep housing costs, and the high number of students at both schools who are considered “rent-burdened,” meaning that they pay more than 30% of their income toward rent. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the UCSB Graduate Student Association took an informal poll of roughly 600 graduate students and found that respondents, on average, spent 48% of their $2,091.98 monthly income on rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers said that the “sick-out” was meant to draw attention to the COLA movement and gather support from graduate and undergraduate students who may not be aware of the movement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s people [here] from [the Graduate Student Association] …  but this is really a separate movement that grad students have started,” said Emily, one of the organizers of Wednesday’s event who declined to give her last name. She explained that the group was mostly composed of union members from UAW 2865.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Similar to Santa Cruz, this is grad students coming up, standing up and saying, ‘What we’re dealing with now is unacceptable,’ and so we’re really following their lead on that,” Emily added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to calling in sick on Wednesday, close to 150 graduate students and supporters marched from Storke Tower to the Arbor, chanting, “C-O-L-A, we need fair pay!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once in the Arbor, several graduate students spoke to the crowd and to students who stopped to watch the demonstration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of you may be wondering why grad students are rallying today … it’s because of the immense hardships that we’re facing. We can choose to keep our heads down and go on with business as usual. Or we can speak up about these hardships,” Rammy Salem, a graduate student in the psychological and brain sciences department, said to the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of us are homeless. Some of us skip meals. Some of us have to work multiple jobs and still work paycheck-to-paycheck,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of us think the cost of living is way too expensive — that ain’t right. So if you agree that grad students deserve to live dignified lives, support the movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers called for the support of undergraduate students, staff and faculty as well, stressing that “it’s not just grad students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pratik Raghu, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Global Studies, said to the crowd that he was at the demonstration because he knew he was just “one serious medical accident away from potentially losing [his] apartment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all out here because we know that we are past the point of asking nicely. Asking nicely doesn’t do shit,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So let’s be a little less nice to the university — in fact, let’s be a lot less nice in making these demands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raghu said in an interview afterwards that he was “nothing more than a participant” in the demonstration, although he felt compelled to speak to the crowd in the Arbor because he is an international student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would hope that we can continue to show strength in numbers as we did on this particular occasion, and I hope that we can come up with a collective program of action that can help us maintain that strength in numbers,” Raghu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other international graduate students spoke to the Nexus about the restrictions they face due to their visas and how that can impact their ability to support themselves throughout the year. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan Tudisco — an international graduate student in the comparative literature department — said that international students in particular are struggling because their visas do not allow them to work for any employer other than the university, excluding a select few </span><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international student work programs. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If UCSB decides not to employ me over the summer, I cannot work somewhere else,” they said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Kagan-Moore, a graduate student in the Department of History of Art and Architecture, said that graduate students as a whole struggle over the summer when there are fewer teaching appointments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve had a couple of health issues that essentially bankrupted me this summer,” Kagan-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because we make so little as instructors of record and as TAs, that has had an extraordinarily deleterious effect on my ability to do my own research and my ability to serve my students. It is a holistic problem and the amount of labor that we render to this institution should be compensated,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Wednesday’s demonstration, organizers said they plan to regroup to begin drafting demands.

So that is the last thing we’re going to do,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t know the victims’ stories. And if they did, people forget about them,” said Lexi Lunchick, a senior film and media studies major and the documentary’s producer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although they’re now confident in the film’s direction, with a bulk of its interviews already completed, Leingang said that he and Lunchick initially struggled over the summer to conceive a pitch for their Fall Quarter 2019 film class, which, if selected, would extend their class into Winter Quarter 2020 for the filming of the movie. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We weren’t really sure what we wanted to do, but we were still meeting frequently to talk, knowing that we wanted to pitch something,” Leingang said. “And then, this summer, we had a really bad string of mass shootings. There were three within a week — El Paso, Dayton and the [Gilroy] Garlic Festival right nearby.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it just kinda clicked that it was like, ‘Oh, this also happened here. Maybe this is something that needs to be told,’” he added. “That was kind of the spark.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the idea for a film in mind, Leingang, along with Lunchick, teamed up with fourth-year philosophy major and director of photography Alex Gorman, second-year film and media studies major and production manager Perris Burnley, second-year film and media studies major and editor Ily Logeais and third-year film and media studies major and sound mixer Aidan Mastrogiorgio to produce the documentary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before getting a chance to pitch the film, Leingang said he first had to enroll in a pitch session during fall quarter. To do so, he, alongside 27 other students with pitches, raced to send in their pitches when the submission portal went live.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whoever had the fastest computers — you’re in,” Lunchick said. “Only 13 [students] got into the actual pitch session, and in the first 60 seconds alone, there were, like, 23 applications,” Leingang added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leingang’s submission made it to the next round. Now flanked by his movie crew, Leingang said he competed against the 12 other teams in an on-stage pitching competition for four spots before a panel of judges that was comprised of industry professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If selected, Leingang said the team would have the opportunity to produce their movie during Winter Quarter 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pitches happened on a Friday and they said that [the results] would get posted midday Monday,” Lunchick said. “We were sitting in class in Pollock [Theater] and we were told it was going to be [released at 12 o’clock] but one of the judges was late giving their answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I got up to go to the bathroom to go see if it was posted and my professor yelled at me to sit down,” Leingang added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But soon after, Leingang and Lunchick saw a Facebook post from their film and media studies group chat that announced which four groups would go on to produce their films. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the people posted the picture of the names of the four that got picked. As soon as we got the notification, we quickly looked and then saw that ours was on there,” Lunchick said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Leingang and his team began planning out interviews shortly after the pitching competition, he said they faced a problem early on: They “had no credibility; we’re just a student film.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leingang said he reached out to Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead and graduate student Melissa Barthelemy, who is writing her dissertation on the Isla Vista tragedy, to help assemble sources. UCSB also aided him in contacting the victims’ parents, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the other crews started filming very quickly, which was panicking at the beginning,” Leingang said. “But once we started rolling, we had names on our film of people who are respected and people who have stories … we’ve had great success with almost everyone we’ve reached out to.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following pre-production, which took about five weeks, Leingang said the team then began filming in mid-November. By mid-February, Leingang said he aims to have all the filming completed in anticipation for its release sometime in March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While conducting interviews, Leingang said he and his team were always sensitive to the grief their subjects were experiencing but was surprised by how “open and willing” people were once the interview began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time, the very first thing they say to me is, ‘Thank you for doing this,’” Leingang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of our interviews was just talking about how it’s good to talk about [the tragedy] every once in a while,” he added. “People are finding it cathartic.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a broader sense, Leingang said the film’s narrative has been heavily shaped by what has been gathered through interviews: “very strong personal stories” that built an understanding of “what they experienced that night, what happened and what happened the next day.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the team conducted interviews — which included a mid-quarter trip to Kentucky — Leingang took note of a common thread expressed by many people who spoke on camera: “What a lot of our interviews have stressed so far is a call for sanity,” in that many people are still overcoming the shock associated with the tragedy.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Lunchick, filming the documentary has been a learning experience, in part because working on the film has exposed her to the changes in Isla Vista since the tragedy, such as the bushes planted at sorority Alpha Phi after two women lost their lives there.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that future generations of UCSB students are always going to be affected,” she said. “You never know if one other student walking by knew someone or their sibling that went here before knew someone.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar sense, Leingang said he came out of producing the film with a new sense of appreciation for life and how quickly things can change in the wake of tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve emphasized this the entire time; you don’t really think it’s going to happen to you or where you live and then to actually have it happen and to you,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We interviewed someone who was supposed to hang out with the girls that ended up being killed. They made a last-minute decision to do something else and if she would’ve continued hanging out with them, who knows what would’ve happened. Stuff like that, it’s eerie, and it sends chills down your spine.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the film makes its initial debut as a 30-minute final project for Leingang’s two-quarter film class, he and Lunchick said they hope to produce an extended version — an hour-long “documentary feature” —  to submit to film festivals in hopes of drawing more attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recalling all the hardships, memories and interviews experienced while producing the documentary, Lunchick said she finds herself returning to the time she and the team flew to Kentucky to interview Bob Weiss, who lost his daughter, Veronika, in the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Something that we realized while we were there is just how one decision of where you are at one point can just change everything for everyone,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there, Lunchick said she had the chance to flip through a photo album that Veronika Weiss had made before she died. Though they had never met, Lunchick said she felt a connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s hard to sometimes believe that such tragic events really happened,” she said. “And it’s moments like that that really stick out and once again feel surreal with it all and put it into perspective that this event was real.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Veronika touched this. We’re holding this book that’s hers.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of the article appeared on p.3 of the Jan. 23 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Courtesy of Dahlia Hylton</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last March, Chancellor Henry T. Yang </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promised</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to provide funding from his office for the creation of the office, the hiring of eight staff members — of which Hylton is the first — and $55,000 annually for programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the creation of the office, Yang said that the development of a Center for Black Student Development, which is meant to be a standalone building, would be “an important priority within campus planning.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the BSU demands team in February and fulfilled by Yang in March but were built upon over 50 years of activism from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton was selected after a national search by a committee comprised of members of the BSU demands team, as well as other campus leaders, according to Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Academic Support Systems Lupe Navarro-Garcia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton said she hadn’t heard about the demands before she saw the job announcement, but that she was aware of “some type of forward movement that was happening, as to why this office was being created.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I’m someone who literally stands on the shoulders of people who look like me, and to be able to be a vessel, if you will, for the amazing work that this institution has done,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students have played such a significant part in bringing this office together.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, a job posting by the Division of Student Affairs described the role of director as an individual who is both capable of overseeing and advising entities — such as the Black Resource Committee and Black Student Union (BSU) — while leading in strategic planning and participating in organizations from the local to national level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The search committee wanted someone that really understood the diversity within the Black community and really had a commitment to intersectional identities and making sure that everyone that set foot in the place where we have that space, or was interfacing with anyone with the office felt welcomed, seen and understood,” said Meridith Merchant, assistant director for Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion for Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and member of the search committee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia noted that Hylton has worked in various multicultural affairs offices at different campuses and at her most recent university, Lehigh University, grew the office from one person to a full staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the work that I have done, particularly within higher education, has been around diversity and inclusion,” Hylton added. “Even when I was cultivating those skills in undergrad and graduate, I just always gravitated towards a space like this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton noted that she has worked in advising offices, Educational Opportunity Program offices and admissions offices in addition to her work in multicultural spaces and said she’s looking forward to working with various offices at UCSB to help students in any way they need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to hold true to the demands that the students brought forth and however that actually manifests its ways, then we’ll actually do that,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Hylton said she’s focusing her time on learning what exactly the needs of the student are, and how she can help facilitate them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first few days, she said she spent time getting to know a lot of different people on campus and building relationships, which she described as key to a position like hers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been able to meet, in my opinion, with some really great, great allies, or potential allies, of the space, and everyone seems so excited, which has given me a lot of energy,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, she’s ready to get to work creating a strategic plan for the office and begin hiring other staff members.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia said they have already hired an assistant director who will begin Feb. 3, and are in the process of looking for an advocacy counselor and an administrative business officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As OBSD moves forward in filling positions, Merchant said “we have to be very intentional and thoughtful” in making future hires, as to meet the BSU demands and properly accommodate new employees as they arrive on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we have space in our suite here for the first tier [of hiring]?” Navarro-Garcia said. “And then we need to start thinking where are we moving to advance to the hiring of tier two and tier three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar sense, Merchant emphasized the need to continue developing OBSD’s infrastructure in an effort to make future employees feel they can perform their job to the fullest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Santa Barbara is not the most diverse place to be. UC Santa Barbara is diverse, but Santa Barbara as a whole [is not],” Merchant said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re inviting people to positions where they’re going to be supporting multicultural students, it’s important that there is the infrastructure, so that you can draw people that will feel supported and be able to continue to do the great work that they’re doing,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hylton, she’s looking forward to doing just that. In the future, she hopes to help create a space where Black students can seek “empowerment, education and inspiration,” while providing them with the resources they need to succeed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really important that UC Santa Barbara realizes that Blackness isn’t monolithic. There’s so many different variations as to who we are as individuals. And to have this office to a vessel or a conduit to helping people understand what those many different nuances of Blackness is going to be really important.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
