Morse argued against same-sex marriage by outlining values of heterosexual unions. Prior to the talk, members of the queer community chanted inside the lecture hall to protest the ideas to be presented by Morse.</p>\n<p>According to Morse, non-traditional marriage negatively affects how children connect to parents.</p>\n<p>“The marriage debate is really about children; all the other issues you hear about can be handled some other way than re-defining marriage,” Morse said. “If we’re going to re-define marriage, we’re somehow re-defining the institution that attaches one generation to another.”</p>\n<p>Morse said forms of “third-party reproduction” like surrogacy are “structural injustices,” because they separate children from their biological parents.</p>\n<p>“Kids need and deserve their own parents and same-sex marriage will enshrine into law the opposite. Same-sex marriage will require the law to say that it’s a myth that kids need their own mothers and fathers,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Anscombe Society president and third-year philosophy major Carlos Flores said the debate on same-sex marriage often lacks important arguments favoring heterosexual unions.</p>\n<p>“In particular, many who support same-sex marriage seem to have never heard the case for why same-sex marriage ought to not be accepted,” Flores said. “They have accepted straw men which they easily knock down.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, same-sex marriage “victimizes” people in unexpected ways.</p>\n<p>“I get that we’re going to have genderless marriage soon, but I just want to say there are going to unanticipated consequences,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Flores said while the talk revealed “worthwhile reasons” to oppose same-sex marriage, he doubts those in favor will change their mind.</p>\n<p>“Because people have very strong feelings on the topic of same-sex marriage, often due to personal struggles,” Flores said. “I think it is unrealistic to expect anyone firmly in support of same-sex marriage to change their mind.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and feminist studies double major Kevin Tang participated in the protest and said Morse’s argument ignores the importance of love in a family unit.</p>\n<p>“She cares so much about traditional family structures that I feel she leaves out the most important aspect of a true family, which is love and support, and I believe that our community is a family that provides exactly what her talk lacked,” Tang said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year earth science major Julian Consoli said he opposes same-sex marriage for religious reasons but did not feel Morse presented well-constructed arguments.</p>\n<p>“I think the basis for her arguments are in religion, in God — which I actually agree with — but I don’t think she was really able to present those really clearly. I was a little disappointed,” Consoli said.</p>\n<p>Consoli also said it is important for “liberal schools” that largely support gay marriage to consider other views.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we should hear other people’s opinions, so I think that’s very important so I did appreciate that. Instead of always butting heads, we should be able to come together and discuss these things,” Consoli said. “I think it’s civil of us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated A.S. Queer Commission protested outside the lecture hall where the event took place. Some of the students involved in the protest were members of the queer community, however were not protesting in affiliation with the commission. In addition, the protestors were not escorted out of the event by Community Service Officers (CSOs), but left on their own accord.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

will host the second annual Isla Vista Memorial Paddle Out on May 27 at 6 p.m. at the beach in front of the UCSB Lagoon and Manzanita Village to honor the lives lost on May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>Following the events of May 23 last year, approximately 3,000 students and I.V. community members attended Surf Team’s first annual paddle out. Students and I.V. community members on surfboards formed a circle about 50 yards offshore, while others remained on the beach. This year, UCSB Surf Team plans to host a similar ceremony, with nearly 3,000 identifying as attending on the event’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year communication major Stephanie Schechter said she expects 2,000–5,000 students to attend, with 1,000 paddling out to form the circle.</p>\n<p>“The reason we expect this turnout not only reflects on last year’s turnout, but also reflects on that this event is very positive,” Schechter said. “By having a really positive event, it might help people heal in a different way.”</p>\n<p>Paddle outs are a century-old Hawaiian tradition to honor the lives of those who have passed away, and they symbolize the belief that spirits continue to live in the ocean, according to Schechter.</p>\n<p>“In the modern sense, it’s kind of like closure,” Schechter said. “It’s sort of a way for the community to unite in remembrance for those who have passed — their spirits are moving on.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication and global studies double major Maggie Vlaco said she has attended many paddle outs, but the strength and unity of the participants in Surf Team’s paddle out in May 2014 was unique.</p>\n<p>“It was honestly one of the most incredible experiences I have been part of,” Vlaco said in an email. “There were so many different opinions and disagreements from people regarding the shootings and the events that happened, but the paddle out was something that we were all 100 percent unified and together on.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Alex Manrique said the event will be open to all community members, including those who prefer to remain on the beach.</p>\n<p>“I surf myself, but I get a really inclusive vibe from this event that’s open to anyone with or without a board,” Manrique said in an email. “I know Isla Vista isn’t this utopia it’s made out to be, but it definitely has its moments. This will definitely be one of those moments.”</p>\n<p>Manrique, a transfer student who did not attend UCSB last year, said the paddle out is a way to unite all attendees in remembrance and solidarity.</p>\n<p>“I’m participating in this paddle out to commemorate those that were lost to last year’s tragedy,” Manrique said in an email. “I feel that anyone who attends, whether they live here or not, is there for the same reason, and that’s to show solidarity.”</p>\n<p>Surf Team plans to provide lifeguards and safety personnel and asks attendees to bring boards, floats, kayaks and wetsuits to the paddle out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/","id":4675,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4674,4673,4672],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Discuss Misconceptions, University Involvement","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista community members met in the I.V.

Clinic Building to discuss Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) during the weekly stakeholders’ meeting.</p>\n<p>Williams proposed AB 3 in December to establish a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V., which, if passed, would tax residents using a Utility Users Tax (UUT) and would garner funds to improve public services in I.V., such as parking and lighting. UCSB Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow presented an update on the university’s position regarding the inclusion of the university in the CSD as outlined in AB 3. Local business owner Jay Freeman gave an hour-and-a hal- presentation on pressing issues in I.V., past attempts to incorporate I.V. into Goleta and Goleta’s cityhood process.</p>\n<p>Freeman said stakeholders should consider going through the LAFCO process to assess whether or not I.V. could become a CSD.</p>\n<p>Thurlow said UCSB is not opposed to a CSD, but does not want the university to be included within I.V.’s boundaries because of the unknown precedent it may set for the UC system.</p>\n<p>“The University of California has communicated with Assemblymember Williams’ office that, at this point, the university should not be in,” Thurlow said. “This does not mean we are opposed to AB 3, this does not mean we are opposed to self-government or any other measures, but because of the nature of what AB 3 is … nobody knows the implications.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, I.V.’s problems such as parking and lighting will not be immediately solved by the establishment of a CSD, as some students may believe.</p>\n<p>“The issues here just kind of stay, and I think it’s something we don’t spend enough time talking about, which is kind of the difference in mindset between students,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said there have been previous efforts to divert I.V. celebrations, such as Halloween, into more structured events.</p>\n<p>“In 2003 we actually had Dia de Los Muertos celebrations on October 31,” Freeman said. “I think it’s interesting that we were already having events on Halloween.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said the current LAFCO board should not be judged based on decisions made by boards in previous years since its members change every year.</p>\n<p>“If you really think that LAFCO in 2001 was a horrible, horrible thing, they’ve replaced their staff, and now have internal staff they don’t contract out anymore,” Freeman said. “All of the commissioners except these two, one of whom is in the room [Craig Geiser] and has been very friendly to us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

After providing temporary summer storage for approximately 200 UCLA students last year, Yoder decided to expand his business to UCSB and rename it BoxCamp. The company provides students with boxes to pack their belongings in, which students then drop off at designated locations on campus. Boxes are stored for the entire summer and will be available for pick-up or can be delivered for a fee at the start of the upcoming school year. BoxCamp offers students either a storage box with dimensions 18x18x16 inches for $35 or two boxes of the same size for $65. Students can also store suitcases, microwaves, mattresses, mini fridges and dressers separately for an additional cost, with insurance provided for all stored items.</p>\n<p>Yoder said students will be able to purchase summer storage and flat-rate delivery beginning the last two weeks of school outside residence halls. BoxCamp will allow students to focus on their studies and not have to stress about moving and storage, according to Yoder.</p>\n<p>“During the tenth week and finals week, we will be tabling for new orders, distributing boxes to students living in the residence halls and picking up their boxes to be stored at an off-campus location,” Yoder said. “This will help many students living in the dorms with the move-out process and allow them to focus on their final exams.”</p>\n<p>Yoder said he began working with the Residence Hall Association (RHA) to bring BoxCamp to UCSB after he learned students have few storage options available to them during the summer, because storage units in Santa Barbara are expensive and tend to fill up quickly.</p>\n<p>“We really hope that we can provide a good service to UC Santa Barbara students that they did not really have offered to them before,” Yoder said. “The goal is to help people save some money and not have to take all their stuff home for the summer.”</p>\n<p>BoxCamp representative and third-year economics and accounting major Harrison Goldblatt said he is working on last minute details with RHA, but expects the service to be ready for students during the last two weeks of school.</p>\n<p>“We are not sure exactly where we will be tabling as of now, but students will definitely see us outside the residence halls and on campus during the last two weeks of school,” Goldblatt said. “There, we will be ready to take student orders for their summer storage needs.”</p>\n<p>First-year actuarial science major Kaila Martinez said BoxCamp could be the solution to her storage problem because she is unable to move her belongings into summer housing in Isla Vista immediately at the end of the school year, and it would be inconvenient for her to store them at home.</p>\n<p>“I cannot move my stuff into my new place in I.V. right after finals and I do not want to move it from the dorms down to Oceanside and then back again,” Martinez said. “BoxCamp seems super convenient and might be the right way to avoid moving my things back and forth.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Following a dance piece titled <em>Not One More</em> and an a capella performance of “Amazing Grace,” participants walked to People’s Park carrying Blunite blue LED lights.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Program Board organized the night’s event, which included an open mic in the park for speakers who wished to share memories of the victims. The vigil concluded with a video screening, paying tribute to the students lost and highlighting the solidarity demonstrated within the I.V. community following the tragedy.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said UCSB will continue to honor the lives lost on May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“Tragedy will not tear us apart but bring us closer together,” Yang said. “We will never forget the loss we suffered a year ago, but we remember not just with sadness, but with fondness.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has established six unique memorial scholarships in honor of each of the victims, according to Yang.</p>\n<p>“We can make their lives more meaningful by the way we choose to live our own, and we can make the lives of others more meaningful in the ways we choose to honor them,” Yang said. “We will uphold their memory now and in years to come with six individual memorial scholarships … individualized to reflect their character and their passions.”</p>\n<p>Academic Senate chair and sociology professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani read a letter on behalf of the Hong family which stated the need for a cultural shift away from violence.</p>\n<p>“James believed in a world without evil, a world where tragic instances like this would never occur. We hope it will become a reality,” the Hong family stated in the letter. “Parenting and mental well-being should be focused on more in family, school and society. We should put more emphasis on moral values and teach kids to see the good in others and respect others.”</p>\n<p>Richard Martinez, father of Chris Martinez, said those affected by the tragedy should continue to live their lives as a testament to those lost.</p>\n<p>“For our absent brothers, daughters, sisters and friends, for their sake we must also live,” Martinez said. “We can mourn for those we lost, and we can go on living. There is no contradiction in this. We must remember that making something of this life is not an affront to the dead.”</p>\n<p>Alan Martinez, uncle of Chris Martinez, said he continues to mourn as memories of the tragedy resurface.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a little afraid of being in a world where people expect me to be over it after a year,” Martinez said. “Every time I forget it, if it’s for a few minutes or a few hours, remembering it again is like going through it again. Every time you forget about it and remember it you have to accept it again.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63764\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1244942648\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63790\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63764\" data-attachment-id=\"63764\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-24/one-year-later-students-remembered-in-candlelit-vigil-and-march/2015-vigil_lorenzo-basilio-21/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1432413353\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2015 Vigil_Lorenzo Basilio-21\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63764\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Isla Vista residents created a memorial in front of IV Deli Mart in remembrance of Chris Martinez. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Kelly Wang, mother of George Chen, said she hopes to see social and political changes prevent future shootings.</p>\n<p>“I pray there will be an end of the senseless killing of innocents,” Wang said. “Murderers must be punished with no excuse, no exception, and no reservation.

But as I told James, George and David’s parents today, in their case there are only good things to say,” Conrad said. “People only said good things of George, David and James when they were with us, because that’s all there was to say.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tragedy will not tear us apart but bring us closer together.

I did everything that I could to make their passing from this life to the next, as comfortable and as painless as possible,” Sullivan said.</p>\n<p>Sullivan also said having experienced the May 23 shooting, he believes individuals should work to improve gun safety.</p>\n<p>“I witnessed firsthand the violence that guns can cause,” Sullivan said. “This will continue until we speak up and change things.

id=\"caption-attachment-63740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo courtesy of UCSB Technology Management Program</em></p></div>\n<p>This year’s New Venture Competition (NVC) Finals awarded its annual $10,000 grand prize to student tech startup Milo, a business projected to create a device that proactively monitors the blood alcohol content (BAC) of individual consumers.</p>\n<p>The NVC is hosted by the UCSB Technology Management Program, which gives entrepreneurial students and researchers on campus the opportunity to develop cutting-edge startups with expert guidance and mentorship. This year’s finalists featured augmented reality video-conferencing business Caugnate, chemotherapy diagnostics company Chemoguard, marketing analytics startup Insiight, hotel door key app Sesamo, cricket flour-producing business Slightly Nutty and the NVC winners, Milo.</p>\n<p>For the “tech-driven” award category, startups Chemoguard and Cognate split second place and Milo won first place, while Slightly Nutty and Sesamo split second place and Insiight won first place in the “market-pull” category. Milo also won the $10,000 grand prize and $2,500 People’s Choice Award, while Chemogaurd won the $5,000 Elings Prize.</p>\n<p>NVC sponsor, venture capitalist and alumnus Jason Spievak, whose software company Invoca hires mostly Gaucho graduates, said the NVC Finals present a vital opportunity for investors to discover promising young potential startups.</p>\n<p>“There’s lots of great stuff coming out of UCSB, and the depth and scope of the engineering talent here compared to when I was in school has become very impressive,” Spievak said. “From a material science perspective, it’s now the number one school in the world.”</p>\n<p>According to Spievak, the NVC develops industry and job production for the benefit of the local and global community.</p>\n<p>“Locally, it creates jobs and it keeps people in Santa Barbara, which is a win,” Spievak said. “Globally there are those occasional technologies like Integrated Fluidics that truly have the potential to save a lot of lives and change the world, and those are innovations that are happening right here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Milo member and computer science graduate student Daniel Imberman said his startup is already in talks with an incubator featuring a technology host angel, and that all his group members are interested in moving the business forward.</p>\n<p>“The high point was the second we got that first working trial,” Imberman said. “Up until then I was just kind of not sure what we were doing was going to amount to anything, but once I saw that data chart it was like, ‘Oh my god. We actually have something.’”</p>\n<p>According to Imberman, participating in the NVC has allowed him to gain knowledge and experience that transcends traditional business and technology curriculum.</p>\n<p>“I’ve learned more and worked more in the past three months than I have I the past two years,” Imberman said. “I’ve had daily 8 a.m. to midnight days. If I wasn’t in school, I was working on this all the time. Honestly even if we hadn’t won a dime I would’ve walked out with so much more business knowledge and just ready to attack the world based on this one competition.”</p>\n<p>Fourth year biochemistry major and Chemogaurd member Letitia Mueller, the only female finalist to win an award in the tech-driven category, said if her startup receives seed capital, it could “open up a whole new world of how to do chemotherapy.”</p>\n<p>“If we have a way to make chemo more effective, we could have people survive through chemo with higher dosages,” Mueller said. “If they can tolerate them or avoid the drugs they can’t tolerate, then that makes chemo more efficient and improves quality of life and reduces costs.”</p>\n<p>Mueller is one of three females to have made it to the NVC finals, along with graduate student in the Bren School of Environmental Science Megan Miranda of Slightly Nutty, who tied for the second place award in the market-pull category, and psychology graduate student Katie Koehler of Insiight, who won first place in market-pull.</p>\n<p>According to Mueller, the lack of female representation in the competition reflects an overall male-dominant trend in the tech industry that she hopes to see eliminated in years to come.</p>\n<p>“People sometimes don’t understand the gravity of the situation when you are one of the few women in your field.” Mueller said. “That being said, it’s really important for women to realize that there are so many avenues you can go down that haven’t been travelled by females. Why is the NVC 90 percent male dominated? It shouldn’t have to be that way.”</p>\n<p><em>[<strong>Correction:</strong> A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Letitia Mueller was the only female to win the New Venture Competition Finals. In actuality, finalists Megan Miranda of Slightly Nutty and Katie Koehler of Insiight won awards in the “market-pull” category. </em></p>\n<p><em>Also, a previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Jason Spievak as referencing to a company called Asta Fluidics instead of the correct </em><em>Integrated Fluidics.

id=\"caption-attachment-63708\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">USC professor Kristen Zaleska spoke Thursday about the prevalence of sexual assault within the armed forces, and the similarities and differences between sexual assault in the military and on university campuses.<em> Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education office hosted a lecture on military sexual trauma (MST) by assistant professor at the USC School of Social Work Kristen Zalesky in the Flying A room Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>Zalesky’s talk highlighted the prevalence of sexual assault in the military and drew parallels between the experiences of civilian sexual assault survivors and sexual assault survivors serving in the military. Zalesky detailed the incidence of MST compared to civilians and discussed stark similarities and contrasts between sexual assault in the military and in civilian life. About a dozen students, primarily interns in the CARE advocacy office, attended the lecture.</p>\n<p>According to Zalesky, there is a parallel between sexual assault at universities and within the military. According to Zaleski, one in two women and one in 12 men experience MST in the course of their service.</p>\n<p>“When you are in a Greek system or university system you have your own reporting process,” Zalesky said. “You have your own police department you have your own way of tracking sexual trauma and you have a culture in which you are kind of confined, and when we’re talking about the military, we’re talking about that in the same way.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky said the military and UC face similar difficulties in addressing sexual assault, and neither are particularly effective.</p>\n<p>“[UC system’s framework] rarely results in a conviction of the assailant and it’s also true for the military,” Zalesky said. “This university culture, it’s not that different from someone who is 18 and chooses military service, in terms of the sexual boundaries.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said the common ideas surrounding how sexual assault occurs usually do not match reality.</p>\n<p>“These are the typical assumptions we make about sexual assault: it’s a random guy in a dark alley; it’s someone we don’t know; they have a weapon,” Zalesky said. “Most often, people who are raped are raped by somebody they have a trusting relationship with — it’s a family member, it’s a boyfriend, it’s an ex-boyfriend, it’s a best friend.”</p>\n<p>According to Zalesky, this difference between the idea of a typical perpetrators and the reality of who they usually are makes reporting more difficult.</p>\n<p>“That’s why when you look at rape reports it’s so hard to get somebody to report because it wasn’t so clear. He wasn’t wearing a mask in a dark alley as a stranger with a knife right? It was your best friend who you’ve partied with for a year and a half,” Zalesky said. “The reason that we hesitate to report sexual assaults is because we’re so confused because it doesn’t match up with the construct of what we imagined.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said those in the armed forces who report are typically required to stay in service, as leave for survivors is not granted most of the time, which makes avoiding assailants virtually impossible. For this and other reasons, sexual assault survivors in the military have fewer options than their civilian counterparts, Zalesky said.</p>\n<p>“From day one this is your brother, this is your sister right? We are a military family,” Zalesky said. “Even if you want to take time off, even if you want to go see your mom, you can’t because you signed this [enlistment] contract.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said the number of male survivors of MST are roughly equal to the number of female survivors — just over 300,000 survivors of both genders — but males are far less likely to report than females.</p>\n<p>“Men are being brutalized as often during military service, but women come forward and it’s more socially acceptable to be a woman that’s been raped than a man that’s been raped … we have an epidemic of men who aren’t talking about their sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky closed with a brief discussion on advocacy and how to help survivors, followed by a question and answer session with the audience. Zalesky said a more effective strategy for combating MST is not necessarily to encourage women to “not get raped” but rather encourage a culture of bystander intervention.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and feminist studies double major Clair Breen said student engagement in issues related to MST is important for continuing advocacy on the problem.</p>\n<p>“I think anything we can do is awesome, especially as college students,” Breen said. “Advocacy work is hard though because it’s hard to see a difference.”</p>\n<p>Breen also said her main take-away from the presentation was related to the difficulties MST survivors face in addressing their assaults.</p>\n<p>“I took away that it’s very hard to report in the military — that it’s a really prevalent issue,” Breen said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/","id":2732,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2731,2730,2729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Scientists Debate Harms and Benefits of GMOs","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB Arts & Lectures and the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) co-hosted a debate titled “The 2015 Arthur N.

Rupe Debate: The Use of Genetically Modified Organisms in Food” at Campbell Hall Wednesday night to deliberate the harms and benefits of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).</p>\n<p>GMOs are living organisms whose genetic codes have been artificially manipulated through the use of various genetic engineering techniques. UC Davis plant pathology professor Pamela C. Ronald and Swiss Federal University senior scientific researcher in the Institute of Integrative Biology Angelika Hilbeck debated on whether the use of GMOs in food is safe, and the role GMOs play in world hunger and poverty. The Chronicle of Higher Education senior reporter Paul Voosen moderated the debate.</p>\n<p>IHC director and German and Slavic studies professor Susan Derwin said the use of GMOs exemplifies the idea of “Anthropocene,” or human influence on the planet.</p>\n<p>“Humans now have the ability to manipulate nature in radical ways and for their own ends,” Derwin said. “In the epic of the Anthropocene, as weather becomes more extreme and as the global population grows, the manipulation of nature promises to increase crop yields and diversify the places where food can be grown.”</p>\n<p>According to Ronald, genetic engineering is neither new nor dangerous and inventions such as “golden rice,” a strain of rice supplemented with vitamin A created through genetic engineering, can be used to combat world hunger.</p>\n<p>“After forty years of commercial use in medicine, cheeses, wine and plants, there has not been a single instance of harm to human health or the environment,” Ronald said. “Instead of worrying about the genes that are in our food … we must ask if farmers and rural communities can thrive and be sure that everyone can afford the food.”</p>\n<p>Ronald said the public’s fear of genetic engineering is due to misinformation, and is a major obstacle in distributing golden rice to rural communities.</p>\n<p>“500,000 children go blind every year because of lack of vitamin A,” Ronald said. “Half of these children will die. We have a lot of fear mongering and what really distresses me is that it is preventing this rice from reaching the children. It’s something we take for granted every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Hilbeck, hunger and vitamin A deficiency in developing countries are part of a much larger issue that genetic engineering alone cannot fix.</p>\n<p>“The kids die because they are poor. We have to address causes of hunger and poverty,” Hilbeck said. “If you don’t address the underlying causes for hunger and poverty, singling out an individual issue will not help. We are helping those kids already by giving them vitamin A pills right now.”</p>\n<p>Hilbeck said the best solution to ending world hunger and poverty is a system that can sustain itself for a long period of time.</p>\n<p>“We need the best solution, the most sustainable solution — not focus on which technology that is — I personally don’t care what technology that is,” Hilbeck said. “I want the problem to be solved, but in a system that in itself functions and works so we can have it run for hundreds of years.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemical engineering major Christopher Nyambura said shifting industrial agriculture to a more efficient system should be the main focus.</p>\n<p>“We need to start changing the way we farm — changing the way we grow crops, meat, all these things, — before we start introducing GMOs,” Nyambura said. “People are dying, people don’t have food. That’s what we need to tackle —  people getting fed and how we can do it as efficiently as possible, as best as possible.”</p>\n<p>According to Hilbeck, debating over GMOs lead to discussions about greater topics such as industrialized agricultures and the dangers associated with it.</p>\n<p>“It’s about much more than GMOs,” Hilbeck said. “They stand in for a system that requires change and if that’s what it takes — GMOs — then that’s what it is. They trigger this debate. As long as we keep arguing, and we keep talking respectfully to each other, listening to each other and try to accommodate, we can move this place forward and progress.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63680\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63680\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/","id":2725,"author":{"id":157,"name":"Kendra Witt"},"related":[2724,2723,2722],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Remembers May 23rd","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Program Board (ASPB) will host the Candlelight Vigil and Memorial Walk this Saturday in Storke Plaza as part of a series of events in remembrance of the events of May 23 last y...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Community to observe anniversary of last year’s tragedy with Candlelight Vigil and Memorial Walk</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_63671\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63671\" data-attachment-id=\"63671\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/isla-vista-remembers-may-23rd/vigil-anniversary_nexus-file-photo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1400962711\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Vigil Anniversary_Nexus File Photo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63671\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Students and community members alike gathered in Isla Vista last May in the wake of the events.

Legal Code, which states campus organizations’ leftover funds not approved for rollover to the next fiscal year will move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee for allocation to related causes. Senate also considered fourteen campus organizations’ requests to roll remaining funding into next year’s accounts, approving ten and denying four.</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and second-year CCS physics major Liam Stanton said he opposed the bill because he feels A.S. should use funding not approved for rollover to secure its own budget, rather than be forced to use it on related causes through the A.S. Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p>“If we did [not pass the bill] we’d have tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes hundreds of thousands, extra and we wouldn’t have to tread water partially every year like we do,” Stanton said. “Anyone in part of A.S. that needed more money could request it and we’d be much more flexible.”</p>\n<p>College of Engineering Collegiate Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothschild said he was concerned the bill does not say what would happen if funds move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee and remain unused.</p>\n<p>“I think there are some holes, specifically when these go into a specific fund for Finance Board; there is nothing saying what happens to them after the year ends,” Rothschild said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said the bill could prevent a “conflict of interest,” because A.S. will not have the option to use money denied for rollover.</p>\n<p>“It would be in our self-interest to deny rollovers, but with this we’re actually making sure that they’re put into Finance and Business,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>College of Letters and Sciences Collegiate Senator and third-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said there could be conflict over how A.S. Finance and Business Committee allocates funds that were denied for rollover.</p>\n<p>“I could see some groups that lost their rollover come and disagree with how the Finance and Business Committee used that money, whether or not that money was used for whatever students voted that money to go towards,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy said Senate should not easily approve campus organizations’ requests to roll over funding.</p>\n<p>“Students paid these fees for this year,” Guthy said. “We should not be setting the precedent of continuously rolling over funds, because students pay for funding this year and they need to go to students this year in services.”</p>\n<p>After much debate, senate tabled the bill indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Senate granted rollover requests to A.S. Media Center, A.S. Bike Committee, A.S. Department of Public Worms, A.S. Commission on Disability Equality, A.S.

Seikaly described what ISIL is, what they stand for, how the group came to be and the violence they have committed. Sabra discussed sectarianism, the Arab Spring and compared ISIL to the terrorist group Al-Qaeda.</p>\n<p>According to Seikaly, the terrorist group was influenced by Saddam Hussein’s authoritarian regime and developed after the United States’ invasion of Iraq. Seikaly said ISIL was not a direct result of Islamic or religious “essentialism.”</p>\n<p>“What I think is important about looking at the history of Arab authoritarianism in Iraq and in Syria and the role of U.S. intervention is understanding that ISIS is a product of historical context,” Seikaly said.</p>\n<p>Sabra said the reason for ISIL’s success in recruiting diverse followers, such as doctors and other professionals from around the world, is that the group claims to be the Islamic government left after Muhammed’s death, or the caliphate.</p>\n<p>“A significant number of people have come, for example, from Europe,” Sabra said. “There have been others who’ve come from other parts of the Arab world — Tunisia has a particularly large contingent. We don’t really know how many more people may be attracted to this movement in the long run.”</p>\n<p>According to Sabra, ISIL recruits people by posting videos about celebration and triumph in addition to their violent footage of executions.</p>\n<p>“ISIS has done a very good job of recruiting people with their slick videos — not all their videos are about violence,” Sabra said. “After they took Mosul, they had all these videos about celebration and their great victory.”</p>\n<p>Seikaly said although ISIL pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda, the group is more than an offshoot of the militant organization: It actively looks to govern and adjudicate a community and aspires to build a state.</p>\n<p>According to Sabra, people draw false conclusions and fail to understand how ISIL developed, which leads to difficulty when attempting to solve the political problems in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“If you know the history, it’s much easier to understand how this has happened, and to also assess the future possibilities for continuing expansion or perhaps ending this movement eventually,” Sabra said.</p>\n<p>UCSB History Club president and fourth-year history of public policy major Darren Chen said people should strive to understand the historical background of the terrorist group and understand ISIL from a different perspective.</p>\n<p>“Obviously we understand that there’s ISIS from a political science perspective, there’s ISIS from a global studies perspective, but people never really had a historical perspective. When you have a historian, it gives you a much different view,” Chen said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily

climb all fourteen 8,000 meter mountain peaks without the use of supplementary oxygen, spoke at Campbell Hall Tuesday night about her 8,611 meter trek up K2, the second highest mountain in the world.</p>\n<p>A skiing, ice climbing and mountaineering enthusiast from the age of 13, Kaltenbrunner used her money working as an oncology nurse to fund her climbing expeditions until climbing the Nanga Parbat in 2003 and finally deciding to mountain climb professionally. As the last leg of Arts &amp; Lecture’s “National Geographic Live” series, Kaltenbrunner’s lecture was accompanied by photography and video to supplement her narrative recounting of trekking up her last 8,000 meter mountain peak: K2.</p>\n<p>Prior to reaching K2’s summit in 2011, Kaltenbrunner had attempted to climb the mountain’s peak six previous times.</p>\n<p>“Six times I had to turn back just before reaching the highest point. Despite those six returns, K2 still resided in my heart,” Kaltenbrunner said.</p>\n<p>For her seventh attempt up the world’s second largest mountain, Kaltenbrunner decided she would bypass the conventional route up the south side of the mountain from Pakistan via the Cesen Route, and would instead go up the North Pillar from China.</p>\n<p>“I had decided for the very unconventional way,” Kaltenbrunner said. “I chose a very difficult route on K2— the North Pillar, a very, very beautiful plane up to the highest point. This is a very challenging way up.”</p>\n<p>During her lecture, Kaltenbrunner detailed the process by which her team — comprised of herself and four men — travelled to the base of K2 from China by crossing the hazardous Shanksgam River on camelback, then proceeded to spend 80 days setting up base, acclimating their bodies to the extremely high altitudes and climbing up the icy, windy, subzero mountainside.</p>\n<p>“[At times] it was far too cold. We couldn’t feel our fingers anymore … It was so difficult for us to stay whole nights in the tiny tent. It was hard to go out,” Kaltenbrunner said. “But when I did go out it was just amazing. We had such beautiful nights, very clear nights full of stars. As you can imagine, up there, there is no light pollution. Many times I could see, from the light of the stars, the shadow from my own body. It’s amazing up there.”</p>\n<p>Kaltenbrunner said what she had felt after reaching K2’s peak and fulfilling one of her life-long dreams was indescribable.</p>\n<p>“In order to successfully reach your goals, and it doesn’t matter which goals they are, you have to be enthusiastic,” Kaltenbrunner said. “Prepare yourself mentally for unforeseeable situations. Maintain calm and serenity in situations that seem to be hopeless … Never give up. Hope that everything will work out in the end. And most importantly, respect nature and follow your own path.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Cody Sturges said the most striking thing about Kaltenbrunner’s lecture were the images of her on the summit and the accounts of her 80-day climbing expedition.</p>\n<p>“The sheer distance she put toward that goal and then finally accomplishing it, it’s really something special,” Stuges said. “The most important thing is to never give up. She kept pushing; she made it.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara native and Ventura resident Joe Norris, Kaltenbrunner’s ability to fight through adversity and approach situations with meticulous preparation are principles that can be applied to everyday goals.</p>\n<p>“Getting a degree or passing a test, setting your goals, being passionate about it — that’s what you can draw from every day experiences,” Norris said. “Just climbing the mountain of life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/","id":2758,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[2757,2756,2755],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The MultiCultural Center (MCC) and English professor Felice Blake hosted a remembrance event on Tuesday in the MCC to create a healing space for students, staff and faculty affected by the events of May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p>Attendees discussed ways to combat racism and sexism in Isla Vista in context of the anniversary of the shooting. The event was facilitated by third-year film major Ashley Baker, who led group activities with Blake and encouraged participants to express their emotions and acknowledge words of healing such as “faith,” “hope” and “power,” as well as words that reflect wounds such as “fear,” “anger,” and “alone.” Blake focused on community building and different resources and systems of support for those who have gone through difficult experiences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even if we want to take up issues of race or sexuality, we realize that we don’t all experience these things in the same way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Blake, increasing police presence and surveillance as a response to the events of May 23 last year has exacerbated the pre-existing tensions between students of color and law enforcement, specifically issues of profiling and biased arrests.</p>\n<p>“Even while these students [of color] believe that safety is a pressing concern, we don’t automatically share the same ideas of safety and security and protection just because we happen to be affiliated with UCSB,” Blake said. “Even if we want to take up issues of race or sexuality, we realize that we don’t all experience these things in the same way.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Womyn’s Commission’s supporting chair and third-year comparative literature and global studies double major Cassie Rubio said administrators reacted to the events of May 23 last year incorrectly. According to Rubio, administrators increased policing while failing to address the roots of the problem, sexism and racism.</p>\n<p>“The increased militant police presence that we now have … is really harmful to communities of color, women, other marginalized groups who have histories with police presence,” Rubio said. “What has not changed is the administration’s failure and blatant erasure of misogyny and racism and serious issues that we need to deal with on our campus. We need more healing spaces that are more focused and informed of these issues.”</p>\n<p>Several attendees recounted their experiences entering the university last fall, expressing they expected an open and loving environment but were faced instead with sexism and racism. One attendee described UCSB’s environment as “disappointing” due to the prevalence of student-filed sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>Participants used the space to discuss their individual emotions about the events of May 23 last year, describe memories and offer advice for those experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and other lasting effects.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Response Network Operations team leader Anthony Rodriguez said students experiencing trauma should recognize there are others who care and many who feel the same way. According to Rodriguez, students have the ability to strengthen Isla Vista through unity.</p>\n<p>“Know that you are not alone, whatever you are feeling — no one can change that,” Rodriguez said. “But there’s so much to do to empower your community. I.V. is not alone. You guys have heart and that’s a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Director of the MCC Zaveeni Khan-Marcus said UCSB should increase representative conversations because, while the events of May 23 last year were shared experiences for the entire student body, they affect individuals differently.</p>\n<p>“[We discussed] the sense of isolation and loneliness that impedes us from creating a community and trying to help each other,” Khan-Marcus said. “Of course everyone came together during the tragedy but two years from now, one will not have a common thread. And then how do we love?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Know that you are not alone, whatever you are feeling — no one can change that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Baker said she is pleased to see how rapidly the campus has grown in the past year.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing the campus grow from last year to this year has been pretty phenomenal,” Baker said. “Of course it’s still going to have its cold spaces. I just see how precious life is and I don’t want to waste a minute of it. Even if it’s scary, I try to push myself to do things I don’t normally do.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/","id":2745,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2744,2743,2742],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Discuss Representation","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IVStakeholder_JohnClow_05.19.2015_05.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IVStakeholder_JohnClow_05.19.2015_05.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, students and government administrators met in the I.V.

Clinic Building Tuesday night for the weekly stakeholders’ meeting hosted by the office of Assemblymember Das Williams.</p>\n<p>Attendees discussed the progress of Williams’s Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which calls for the creation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. On Wednesday of last week, the California State Assembly Committee on Local Government voted 6-1 to re-refer AB 3 to the Joint Committee on Fairs, Allocation and Classification, the first in a long series of steps towards the bill’s passage through the state legislature.</p>\n<p>Community organizer with Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said AB 3 will now go to the Assembly Appropriations Committee to request the State cover the cost of a county-level election to approve of the potential CSD.</p>\n<p>“Since the state is requiring the county put it on the ballot, that’s a state mandate so now it has to go to appropriations and we have to figure out if the state is going to reimburse the county for the cost of the elections,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>Elliott said UCSB is currently included within the boundaries of the proposed CSD, though the university’s involvement in the CSD remains unclear. UCSB administration as well as the UC Office of the President (UCOP) have expressed concern about participating in the CSD, according to Elliott.</p>\n<p>“The university has concerns about being in the district and it’s been picked up by UCOP,” Elliott said. “They had a meeting in Sacramento with Das where they said they were concerned about being in the district. We’re trying to set up a meeting with the chancellor and some of his team with Das to kind of negotiate that and get what their concerns are and potential solutions.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District board member Jacob Lebell said he is in favor of both university and county representation on the CSD board. Presently, AB 3 calls for a seven member board — five of whom are to be elected with two standing positions, one for UCSB and one for Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we would be doing would involve the university and the county and bringing them into the process for it would greatly increase the ease of collaboration and help us to navigate both institutions as well,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>Lebell said he would prefer the university representative be elected by the Academic Senate which has multiple people, rather than by the Chancellor alone, as the bill language currently states.</p>\n<p>“I just like the idea of having the appointed person maybe be appointed by the Academic Senate,” Lebell said. “I feel like I would trust that person to be look from the university’s perspective, but whose loyalty would be to I.V. and not looking to simply represent the chancellor’s office. It would make it more of a democratic process to elect that position, having a body instead of one person able to appoint.”</p>\n<p>In discussions regarding the extent to which the university and county standing positions should participate in decision making, UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) psychologist Jeremy Roark said the standing positions could serve as board members who advise but do not vote.</p>\n<p>“I wonder if it’s possible to outline the appointed positions in a way in which perhaps they are voting for some things but not all things,” Roark said. “Maybe there are certain things we are okay with them voting on but others we are not.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said her main focus is to ensure the two appointed board members are well-informed about I.V., regardless of whether they vote or not.</p>\n<p>“I’m not attached to them having voting powers, but what I did like about having those two seats is that I looked at those as two seats that would serve out all four years,” Soutar said. “So for me I thought, especially if they’re going to be staggered, there will always be someone who knows the conversations that have happened in the past four years.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said he agrees with Soutar that the university and county-appointed board members should be knowledgeable about I.V.’s history in order to contribute to informed discussions before decisions are made.</p>\n<p>“I think their role is very much to be that continuity or to say, ‘This happened before,’ or, ‘You should consider this,’” Minoiefar said. “And they need to be there at all of the discussions and need not take part in the vote, but they need to be there.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63615\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63615\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/","id":4674,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4673,4672,4671],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":116,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
