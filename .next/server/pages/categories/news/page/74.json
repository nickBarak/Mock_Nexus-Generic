The group had no high-altitude training and no previous experience hiking the summit.</p>\n<p>The climbers woke up the day of the climb at 2 a.m. to begin the ascent by 3 a.m. They summited the mountain by 11:30 a.m., taking a one-hour break at the crest and then continuing down the mountain to reach the base at approximately 5:30 p.m. By midnight they arrived back in I.V., and many cadets attended class the following day.</p>\n<p>The excursion was incorporated into the ROTC preparation for the Ranger Challenge competition in Fall Quarter, during which 11 UCSB ROTC cadets compete as a team in a series of military skills events against teams of cadets from other universities around the country.</p>\n<p>ROTC cadets Dominique Chan, third-year global studies major, and Theo Vance, second-year communication major and a team captain who helped organize the climb, both described the ascent to Mt. Whitney’s peak as a mental and physical test that rivaled anything they have experienced in their cadet training.</p>\n<p>The typical hiker will take two days to make the climb, camping overnight at 10,000 to 12,000 feet to acclimate to the elevation and then summit the mountain the following day.</p>\n<p>Both Chan and Vance agreed, however, that the one-day climb made for a more rewarding endeavor, with more notable bragging rights.</p>\n<p>“I have never done something that gnarly before. I knew it would be hard. I didn’t realize it was going to be that hard,” Vance said. “But it was the comradery of it. ROTC kids are kind of tough by necessity. So just knowing that you’re not the only one being pushed, that you’re all in it together, and you start as a team, and you finish as a team.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78234\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78234\" data-attachment-id=\"78234\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/img_4218/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4218\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78234\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Dominique Chan</em></p></div>\n<p>Chan said the climb was definitely harder than she had anticipated. Though many cadets had taken Diamox prior to reaching Mt. Whitney, a diuretic that reduces the symptoms of altitude sickness, the elevation was by far the most difficult aspect to overcome and caused extreme shortness of breath and painful headaches throughout the group.</p>\n<p>“Reaching those heights in one day really starts to get at you,” Chan said. “[Elevation] really is the great equalizer and it’s quite humbling, actually … There’s still that kind of varying level of fitness, but I think it’s interesting that the most fit cadet was struggling, relatively, as much as the least fit person who went up to Mt. Whitney.”</p>\n<p>Vance said the cadets were told this was likely one of the most challenging times in the last 10 years to make the climb because of heavy snowfall this past winter.</p>\n<p>“The trail normally takes you on this marked path that has a railing and all this stuff. That was about 10 feet below us, apparently, from all the snow,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>He added that the use of ice axes and crampons, traction devices attached to footwear for improved stability, were “absolutely vital” because the path was difficult to navigate.</p>\n<p>Vance said the warm weather made for a beautiful day to climb but also increased the difficulty of the ascent.</p>\n<p>“[The snow] was very soft, very sludgy, and that’s very dangerous on this portion called the chute, which is kind of the steepest part,” Vance said.<br>\nThe cadets made the climb up the snow chute, an area directly between the switchbacks and face of the mountain, in approximately an hour and a half with the help of their snow equipment.</p>\n<p>“It’s just straight absolute uphill, and you are just ice-axing it the entire way and using your crampons,” Vance said. “Even with that, you’re slipping and sliding sometimes, and you lose your footing.”</p>\n<p>“Without the crampons, we could have fallen to our death, basically, or rolled down, tumbled down,” Chan added.</p>\n<p>Vance said being comfortable with the ice equipment became critical on the descent down the snow chute, a 60-degree downhill that measures approximately 1,500 feet.</p>\n<p>“The chute, because it was so steep, there’s no way to get back down,” Vance said. “So it took us about an hour and a half, hour and 40 to get up, and for me personally it took about 35 seconds to get down.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78236\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78236\" data-attachment-id=\"78236\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/img_4248/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4248\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78236\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Dominique Chan</em></p></div>\n<p>The cadets trekked through varied terrain throughout the day, with changes in environment coming quickly with little warning.</p>\n<p>“When you’re coming up, it’s just kind of mountain wilderness,” Vance said. “Then eventually, out of nowhere, it just turns into snowy woods … The higher you get it just becomes more and more just kind of rocks and boulders and just snow. Then, once you get past the chute, it’s just all mountain range. Once you’re up at the steep portion, you go behind this ridgeline, and pretty much there you can see just for miles, just mountain tops.”</p>\n<p>“At that point you’re going single file, so you get to the hardest part, and then single file, you’re hugging the side of a mountain,” Chan added. “That’s like 13,000 feet, so the last part is only a thousand-foot climb, but it’s just, like, two more miles of just making your way up there.”</p>\n<p>Vance said while the snow made the journey more challenging, it also added to the beauty of the scenery.</p>\n<p>“You can see just mountain ranges on mountain ranges and you can see the lakes and rivers and stuff, but they’re frozen over,” Vance said. “It’s kind of interesting to see the different tints of snow because you can pick out different landmarks, but it’s still just all snow. It’s really beautiful.”</p>\n<p>Cadets who wanted to make the climb trained throughout Spring Quarter at 5:30 a.m. three days a week for an hour prior to their required ROTC workouts at 6:30 a.m. The group also met Wednesday nights for skills training, for a total of four additional hours of training a week.</p>\n<p>“The team that wanted to come out, we had tryouts, and kind of the incentive for them to work hard this quarter was that at the end we would climb Mt. Whitney,” Vance said. “The training was kind of geared around getting people in shape for Ranger Challenge and teaching them stuff that they would need to know but also to prepare for Whitey as well.”</p>\n<p>Both Chan and Vance said they packed only granola bars and water to sustain themselves through the climb.</p>\n<p>“I had probably a 25-pound pack and half of it was probably water. I didn’t end up drinking all of it, but it was important that some people brought more for the people that brought less because a lot of people ran out along the way,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Chan said as an inexperienced climber she appreciated all the research the team captains put into preparing for the trip to ensure the entire group’s safety.</p>\n<p>“The team captains made sure to really study up and research what was needed ahead of time to really make sure to take care of their people,” Chan said. “Overall, not only was it a really cool adventure, but I think it was a really good leadership training exercise for the people who were in charge of this trip.”</p>\n<p>Vance said although four members of the group had to turn back due to altitude sickness, he was still very happy that the remaining 12 were able to reach the summit with little trouble.</p>\n<p>“We all came back as a group,” Vance said. “I was very, very impressed with how many people got through it, considering how tough it was and just the conditions … like the sheer brutality of it, because altitude sickness is one of those things you can’t train for.”</p>\n<p>Chan said team comradery motivated the cadets to reach to the top, as they relied on each other for support to push their physical and mental boundaries.</p>\n<p>“There were definitely periods of just silence, I think mostly because people were just so tired and so focused that it would take even more energy to even talk,” Chan said. “But I don’t think I could have made it up there without all my friends.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students work at a table inside the McNair scholars room. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>President Donald Trump’s education budget released on May 23 calls for a $9.2 billion rollback in spending for several educational programs. Among them, the McNair Scholars Program may face the steepest cut.</p>\n<p>The McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement is a federal scholarship offered to first-generation, low-income students or those who belong to underrepresented minorities in the United States. By pushing these students toward doctoral degrees, the program hopes to diversify faculty in universities across the country.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara began the McNair program in 2007, and it has since guided over 50 students to masters and Ph.D. programs. Though UCSB houses a smaller department than other universities, current and former McNair scholars say their education would have been impossible without it.</p>\n<p>Jamelia Harris, a first-year doctoral student at UC Los Angeles, graduated from UCSB last year with the university’s highest honors — the Thomas More Storke Award.

In an off-camera briefing on May 22, the Office of Management and Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, said the McNair program had not accomplished its objectives.</p>\n<p>“The last time the Department of Education looked at this, it was 6 percent effective — 6 percent,” Mulvaney said.  “I can’t do that anymore.  We can’t do that anymore.  We cannot defend programs like that — 6 percent just doesn’t cut it.”</p>\n<p>Beth Schneider, UCSB McNair program chair, said Mulvaney’s statement lacks context. When she read the proposal, she said, “I was shocked — but not surprised.”</p>\n<p>Approximately 1 percent of undergraduates graduating in 2005 earned their doctorate by 2015, according to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In comparison, Schneider said, a 6 percent doctorate rate for McNair scholars is a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Still, the U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.) report says “McNair is a high cost per-participant program that serves relatively few students.” There is limited evidence of effectiveness for both of these programs,” the<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget18/summary/18summary.pdf\"> report</a> reads.</p>\n<p>Schneider acknowledged that this is true — the McNair program serves a niche group of students at a high cost — but explained that it is essential to prompt students toward a graduate education if they are to return to UCSB as a diverse group of educators.</p>\n<p>Syrian Truong, a transfer student who plans to apply to graduate school next year, began the McNair program after moving to Santa Barbara from Fresno. Truong is gay, a first-generation student and a multiracial Asian-Latino American. For people who don’t experience educational barriers as a part of their daily life, he said, the value of structural support is difficult to explain.</p>\n<p>“There’s a certain amount of condescension as you start moving higher and higher up … you look around and you start seeing less and less of people that look like you,” he said. “For me, that was never a problem before, but it starts to get grating.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78223\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1357638069\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78283\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78223\" data-attachment-id=\"78223\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/mcnair-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1357&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1357\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McNair 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=888%2C589&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78223 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1-1024x679.jpg?resize=888%2C589\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78223\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos of McNair scholars and faculty advisors line the walls of the McNair program trailer next the Veteran Resource Center at UCSB. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The concept of graduate school appealed to Truong as a first-year at UCSB, but he said it would have been “a much harder road” without the McNair program.

As a result, the D.O.E. report used possibly outdated information spanning from 1989 to 2000.</p>\n<p>Schneider said the D.O.E.<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/highered/mcnair/mcnair.pdf\"> study</a> does not match trends at UCSB, where each cohort since 2007 has either surpassed the 6 percent doctorate rate or is well on its way to meeting this percentage.</p>\n<p>Last year, Harris and several other students spoke to UC President Janet Napolitano to push for a more proportionate number of faculty to match the amount of black Californians.</p>\n<p>“If we have the president of an entire University of California admittedly saying that these programs are necessary for the improving the retention and recruitments of faculty of colors,  I personally don’t see why our actions aren’t embodying those sentiments,” she said.</p>\n<p>After the federal budget was proposed last week, Napolitano spoke out against the proposed cuts. Though she focused on rollbacks to the National Science Foundation and energy science programs, she said the proposed cuts could affect more than 133,000 UC students.</p>\n<p>“As president of the nation’s largest public research university, I urge Congress to immediately begin work on a revised budget proposal that makes meaningful investments to help our students, protect our patients and keep America’s research enterprise preeminent,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/","id":2380,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2379,2378,2377],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Once ‘At-Risk Youth’ Dela Cruz Receives UCSB’s Highest Honor","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0350.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0350.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Dela Cruz has served several positions in A.S., is currently completing her thesis on the history of the Ventura School for Girls and will be graduating with a bachelor's degree in history of public p...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Paola Dela Cruz was once considered an “at risk” youth; she used to get in fights, routinely show up late to class and fail to turn in homework assignments.

Yang. The Storke Award is the highest accolade a student can receive at UCSB. <em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I am a real-life example of second opportunities and believing in the potential of kids despite what is happening around them,” she said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz tells people with pride that she is from Compton. She sees a great deal of similarity between Compton and Isla Vista, especially in the negative narratives that have come out of both communities.</p>\n<p>Compton’s reputation of crime and violence had, for a long time, kept her from sharing about her hometown. It was during her time at UCSB, however, that she learned to embrace Compton and to take pride in the “solidarity between black and brown people” there.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz was just a freshman during the Deltopia riots and the Isla Vista shooting of May 23, 2014, which both occurred within a month of each other. The news coverage portrayed I.V. with a lot of “negativity,” she said, and she began to see the same narrative come out of I.V. as with Compton.</p>\n<p>From then on, Dela Cruz set out to make known the positive aspects of Isla Vista: its “wonderful” parks and the children and families that live here alongside college students.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz was elected as an Associated Students (A.S.) senator in 2014 and sworn in days before the shooting. Later that year she won election as a board director with the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD), which was, at the time, the only government agency in I.V.</p>\n<p>Having served a year with IVRPD and A.S. Senate, Dela Cruz sought election as the A.S. external vice president of local affairs (EVPLA).</p>\n<p>As EVPLA, she created the Beloved Community Conference, an annual meeting for Isla Vista residents to voice their experiences and concerns.</p>\n<p>However, her term was characterized largely by her outreach to I.V.’s Latinx families, which she said exist behind a “barrier” beyond the community of college students in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about, ‘These poor families; they need our help.’ It’s not about that. It’s about, ‘How can we work together and help together?’” she said. “Let’s just talk. We’re friends, we’re just ‘gente,’ we’re ‘raza.’ Let’s just get together and talk.”</p>\n<p>The Storke Award recipient is selected by a committee appointed and chaired by Margaret Klawunn, the vice chancellor of student affairs.</p>\n<p>The committee looks for graduating seniors who have demonstrated outstanding scholarship and extraordinary service to the university and its students. Katya Armistead, dean of the Office of Student Life, said the recipient must demonstrate courage, persistence, achievement and a GPA of 3.5 or above.</p>\n<p>“[Dela Cruz] leads with her heart, but she’s also brilliant. That combination, when you see it in someone, it’s pretty rare,” Professor Rick Benjamin, one of several faculty and staff to nominate Dela Cruz for the Storke Award, said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“[Dela Cruz] leads with her heart, but she’s also brilliant. That combination, when you see it in someone, it’s pretty rare.” -Professor Rick Benjamin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pegeen Soutar, the chair of the IVRPD board, said that Dela Cruz demonstrates a wonderful understanding of Isla Vista and that long-term residents adore her.</p>\n<p>“I think she just has an outstanding commitment to this community,” Soutar said. “The woman is smart, she’s compassionate, she really listens.”</p>\n<p>Rachel Arriaga, an analyst in the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and another staff member to nominate Dela Cruz, said Dela Cruz blossomed at UCSB and became a leader in the community.</p>\n<p>“She’s leaving UCSB a better place,” Arriaga said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz is graduating with a 3.7 GPA, and she is completing her thesis on the history of the Ventura School for Girls, a California state institution established in 1913 for delinquent girls.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she heard that she won the Storke Award after receiving a call from Chancellor Henry T. Yang around midnight over a week ago. She said her first reaction was to hide; she couldn’t believe she had been given the award.</p>\n<p>“All these wonderful women I’ve worked with came to mind,” she said. “The reason why I’m getting it is in so many ways because of you all.”</p>\n<p>After graduation, Dela Cruz plans to participate in the California Capital Fellows Program and work on a graduate degree in public policy from Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>Much further into the future, Dela Cruz says she hopes to attain a law degree and later work with youth who face serious criminal sentences.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on how she’s grown while at UCSB, Dela Cruz said she’s become more comfortable as a woman of color, learning to heed the advice of poet Audre Lorde to “trust [her] gut.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a radical act,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly said Paola Dela Cruz attended a high school in Compton.

The project’s executive director, LuAnn Miller, said the facility serves an average of 100 children per year.</p>\n<p>Miller said 90 percent of those children are from low-income families, enabling parents to work and attend school to support their families.</p>\n<p>“Our campaign [to purchase the building] raised $1.2 million to accomplish this feat, thus ensuring the youngest residents of Isla Vista/Goleta will receive early care and education in our fully day, year found nationally accredited program,” Miller said in an email.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, another recipient of the CDBG, applied for funding to increase awareness about sexual assault and reach out to parts of the Isla Vista community not usually serviced through UC Santa Barbara, according to Program Director Idalia Gomez.</p>\n<p>“Although there are great services at UCSB, City College students, Latino families and Spanish-speaking community members don’t often access services through the university,” Gomez said. “So we wanted to ensure that through this program that they would be able to have access to very similar services but through the community.”</p>\n<p>Gomez said the county recently recommended that the center receive CDBG funding for the upcoming year, but after learning that the grant may not go through, such accommodations were placed on hold.</p>\n<p>“At this point, we’re not sure if those recommendations will move forward in the future, but on our side we continue to work to ensure that our services are available to the greater community of Santa Barbara,” Gomez said.</p>\n<p>Leah Gonzales, program manager of Women’s Economic Ventures (WEV), said for a number of years WEV has been awarded CDBG funds for business planning classes that aim to help low-income women launch or expand their business.</p>\n<p>When she learned about the proposed cuts to the program, she said she was “cautiously optimistic” it would not pass due to the amount of people affected in local communities.</p>\n<p>“Probably the average person may not understand or have heard of the CDBG grant,” Gonzales said. “But we have launched our own advocacy efforts to really help educate the community on how important and how integral these funds are to the many nonprofit organizations, especially in Santa Barbara County, that depend on it.”</p>\n<p>In mid-April WEV participated in a #Fight4CDBG press conference, organized by the Santa Barbara Mayor, Helene Schenider and attended by Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fight4CDBG?src=hash\">#Fight4CDBG</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/usmayors\">@usmayors</a> Santa Barbara Groups Say Threatened Federal Block-Grant Program Fills Critical Needs <a href=\"https://t.co/zWriAo5Lcw\">https://t.co/zWriAo5Lcw</a></p>\n<p>— Helene Schneider (@MayorHelene) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayorHelene/status/854187564982452224\">April 18, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Gonzales said while advocacy efforts helped pass a resolution that maintained or increased funding for CDBG, it will only be active until Sept. 30.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Joined <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayorHelene\">@mayorhelene</a> to oppose President’s devastating budget cuts to vital <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CDBG?src=hash\">#CDBG</a> programs on the Central Coast: <a href=\"https://t.co/PJzG7io2IV\">https://t.co/PJzG7io2IV</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/FhvLShJQnI\">pic.twitter.com/FhvLShJQnI</a></p>\n<p>— Rep.

id=\"caption-attachment-78246\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Over 40 people were in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting, with several people voicing their concerns about the way law enforcement deals with cases.</p>\n<p>The town hall began with a description of the CSD and its powers. Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the bill that established the I.V. CSD, allows the district to provide eight specific services, including the ability to “contract” with the county and the UC Regents for “additional police protection services.”</p>\n<p>The CSD’s board is looking to exercise that power to improve public safety, as the amount of reported sexual assaults reached 48 this previous year.</p>\n<p>Members of the public took issue with the way law enforcement distributes information about crimes. During public comment, many said they were worried some crimes were not being reported in UC Police Department (UCPD) timely warnings or in the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) press releases.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board member Daniel Torres began the public comment with concerns about the way law enforcement chooses to distribute information.</p>\n<p>Torres alluded to a crime reported by SBSO in April, when two male subjects allegedly assaulted a 28-year-old man after making comments about his sexual orientation. The event occurred on Sunday of UC Santa Barbara’s pride week, and while SBSO investigated the incident as a hate crime, it did not release a statement immediately.</p>\n<p>Torres said he wished to see more transparency from local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“When you are a part of these communities and people in your community are physically getting assaulted because of their identity, that’s something people need to know about ASAP,” Torres said.</p>\n<p>I.V. resident Andrew Pragin expressed his own concern over why he did not receive a timely warning email from UCPD about a stabbing this weekend, which UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson addressed by saying the department does not send timely warnings for every incident in I.V.</p>\n<p>Olson said not all incidents are handled by UCPD because its main jurisdiction is the UC Santa Barbara campus and it is not responsible for patrolling all of the I.V. area. UCPD has a crime log on its website of all the incidents the department responds to, he said.</p>\n<p>“I think some of the misunderstanding is that the UCPD or the campus has this overarching obligation to send out timely warning to the I.V. community, and that’s not always the case,” Olson said.</p>\n<p>In reference to the stabbing, Olson said since there were arrests made and there was no more “ongoing risk” to the public, an additional alert is not recommended.</p>\n<p>“They would frown on us just sending out the alerts under those circumstances,” Olson said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78261\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78261\" data-attachment-id=\"78261\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/img_0835/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0835\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78261\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>While Olson said additional alerts in these cases are excessive, members of the public express a desire to know more about the process that their cases go through after they are reported to the police.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Batsheva Stoll echoed other speakers’ words on law enforcement transparency.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she and her friends suspected they were being stalked one night in I.V. and reported the incident to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), but she said they did not receive follow-up information about what the authorities were doing to investigate the incident.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she would have liked to know what steps IVFP was taking to investigate the incident and said she believes the public would benefit from understanding the steps law enforcement takes when responding to the public’s concerns.</p>\n<p>“It would be helpful if there was some sort of response system where the person was aware of how it was being dealt with for peace of mind,” Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Among the proposed solutions to the public’s interest in the investigative process was the formation of a civilian review board to internally analyze the work local law enforcement is doing.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann brought into question the way crime is being analyzed, questioning how the law enforcement groups that patrol I.V. are using their data.</p>\n<p>Olson said UCPD creates internal reports and discusses strategies to address crime trends at monthly meetings.</p>\n<p>“In the past we’ve done some bait bike enforcement … We have GPS tracking devices. We certainly see that bike theft is a big issue on campus,” Olson said. “So we do have a number of issues that pop up and we track the data and we look at times and we do deploy officers accordingly.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said while law enforcement agencies are collecting data, the way they currently analyze it leaves room for improvement. She said she met with the County Executive Office to discuss data analysis and found that “internally we don’t do that as well as we should,” and she and believes this is the starting point for addressing crime in I.V.</p>\n<p>CSD board members proposed alternative modes of policing that are intended to be less intimidating than traditional police and would aid in improving public perception of law enforcement.</p>\n<p>The board suggested the expansion of the Community Service Officer (CSO) program currently put in place by UCPD as well as creating a “Student Neighborhood Assistance Program” (S.N.A.P.), both of which work as intermediaries between police and the public.</p>\n<p>According to the board’s presentation on public safety, S.N.A.P. would use student works as “first responders” to noise complaints, which they believe would help deescalate confrontations with police in I.V.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78282\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78282\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/","id":4408,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4407,4406,4405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Career Services To Replace Gaucholink with New Jobs Database","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-30-at-3.40.53-PM.png?resize=355%2C224&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-30-at-3.40.53-PM.png?resize=745%2C224&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Career Services plans to replace in June its online jobs database, Gaucholink, with a new website called Handshake.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Career Services plans to replace in June its online jobs database, Gaucholink, with a new website called Handshake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake is a website that connects over 170,000 schools with over 120,000 employers across the nation, including 95 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Students can expect to receive an email invitation to join Handshake around June 16. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services suggests students download any important documents from Gaucholink before the end of Spring Quarter.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Gaucholink, Handshake connects students to employers and provides potential internship opportunities by allowing students to share their resumes and search and apply for jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services counselor and coordinator Eric Wilder said </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake allows students to create a “more in-depth profile,” which he said will allow them to more easily find jobs and internships as well as interact with employers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers searching to recruit college students are able to access Handshake and view the resumes of applicants, which are directly displayed on the students’ profiles, and post employment or internship opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake is designed to provide organizations with a “single login experience” in which they can find all the necessary information about a student on one interface. Career Services staffers believe this will encourage employers to interact more with the website and the students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services expects Handshake to provide an “easier” and more “user-friendly” interface that will increase communication between companies and students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB students can access a much wider array of employment and internship opportunities [with Handshake],” Wilder said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also uses algorithms “similar to the ones on Netflix” to match students with jobs or internships that correspond to their interests and areas of study. It is for this reason that Handshake provides a more “fluid experience” for both students and employers, Wilder said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake additionally allows students to look for career fairs, establish interviews with prospective employers and search for other career-related events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are looking into future rollouts that will allow students to easily identify career events and resources that match their interests,” Wilder said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78196\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78196\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/","id":2383,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2382,2381,2380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Scam-Free Ticketing Platform Wins New Venture Competition","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0393.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0393.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This year’s New Venture Competition’s first-place winner is CRYPTIX, a ticketing platform which uses blockchain technology to make the process safer by eliminating fraud and scalpers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s New Venture Competition’s first-place winner is CRYPTIX, a ticketing platform which uses blockchain technology to make the process safer by eliminating fraud and scalpers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They received the first place prize of $10,000 to continue the development of their company.

The seller made 10 copies of the exact same ticket and sold it to 10 different people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So every day, for the next three days of the festival, it was a race to be the first in line. Only the first ticket would show up as valid, and the other nine would be invalid,” Martitsch said. “So needless to say, this was a terrible experience for me.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta Leaf Labs, a team developing THC- free marijuana, won the second place prize of $7,500 and the $5,000 Elings award for a total of $12,500 — walking away with the most cash prizes. California recently passed Proposition 64, legalizing marijuana, which leaves them with no close competition anywhere in the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanderlease, a website designed to make subleasing easier, won $5,000 dollars for third place. The six team members are all part of Alpha Kappa Psi, a co-ed professional business fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shikha Sharma, a fourth-year political science major, said he thought of the idea for the website after having a difficult time finding housing while interning in New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people’s choice award went to Collatera, a startup that has created a bandage-type patch which could be applied on diabetic foot ulcers. It heals foot ulcers up to four times faster than similar patches currently on the market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team won $5,000 as well as a honorary award of $2,500. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has completed trial studies on mice and will start live clinical trials at Harvard University and Tufts Medical Center this summer. Two members of the team will be moving to the East Coast after they graduate in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OrganicMatters received the second honorary award. The team members seek to partner with poultry farmers and collect bird waste to make into fertilizer, which helps the environment by disposing of byproduct in a profitable manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PhantaField won the third honorary award, and its members are currently developing augmented reality glasses.

This resolution, however, divided the Senate.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to taking a position on something we can take a position on whatever we want,” said then-Senator Batsheva Stoll. “When it comes to student fees and students’ money, we have to be more careful with what we fund and what we won’t.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78182\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78182\" data-attachment-id=\"78182\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/a-s-ucsb-senators-sworn-in-for-2017-18-term/senate-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"senate 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78182\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?resize=500%2C333\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/senate-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78182\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former A.S. senator Charles Neumann sports a toga for his last Senate meeting.

Sandhu said that she will not be taking any more applications, but will conduct interviews with those who submitted applications over the course of the next week.</p>\n<p>She also expressed her disappointment in the polarized start of their first Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>“You aren’t even allowed to mention parties in Senate,” Sandhu said. “I was so disappointed.

A court date has been set for Sept. 15 of this year. <em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The parents of UC Santa Barbara students James Hong and David Wang — the shooter’s roommates — and their friend, George Chen, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in March 2015 against the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and Capri Apartments, arguing that their deaths could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>While the Sheriff’s Department has been dropped from the lawsuit, Hi Desert Mobile Home Park L.P., the company that owns Capri Apartments, and Asset Campus Housing (ACH), a third-party student housing property management company, are still on the lawsuit and will face trial on Sept. 15.</p>\n<p>The defendants submitted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, but it was rejected this year on Feb. 10.</p>\n<p>Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, the two L.A.-based law firms representing the victims’ parents, claimed negligence and wrongful death against the two companies, which they believe should have properly vetted Elliot Rodger before assigning him to be Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>According to court documents obtained by the Nexus, the parents’ original complaint against the two companies alleged Capri Apartments was warned Rodger was a “violent and dangerous threat to his roommates.”</p>\n<p>Allegedly, the apartment company “had actual and constructive knowledge of his bizarre behavior,” yet still did not conduct a “reasonable investigation” before assigning him as Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>“Plaintiffs are informed and believe that [the two companies], through their on-site management personnel, were aware that law enforcement officers had come to Apt. #7 due to a dispute between Rodger and his roommates,” according to the original 2015 complaint.</p>\n<p>The complaint says as a result of the two companies’ “negligence,” Hong, Wang and Chen were “rendered completely vulnerable” to Rodger and “subjected to his violent acts, which caused their deaths.”</p>\n<p>The families are suing for any psychological, emotional or physical pain caused by the deaths of the three victims and are seeking compensation as “the Court deems just and proper.”</p>\n<p>“[The parents of Chen, Hong and Wang] have incurred funeral and burial expenses and suffered extreme and severe distress, pain, anguish and other economic and non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Hong and Wang were assigned to Apt. #7 at Capri Apartments of Seville Road in September 2013 despite several complaints from Rodger’s old roommates about his mental well-being.</p>\n<p>In late 2011, Rodger was assigned two Hispanic male roommates who he said were “rowdy, inferior, pig-faced thugs,” according to his manifesto. Within days of meeting them, he insulted them and told them he was “superior,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>In September of 2011, Rodger was assigned a new roommate who, a few months later, “began to fear for his personal safety,” according to the complaint the parents’ lawyers filed.</p>\n<p>According to the roommate’s complaint to the apartment complex, “Living with Eliot [sic] is like living with a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, and the only way to solve this problem is by removing it. We are at the point where I fear for my safety.”</p>\n<p>The parents’ lawyers claim in a Feb. 10, 2017, court document that the three victims “simply would not have been killed” if the companies had complied with “basic industry standards and at a reasonable level of care.”</p>\n<p>A representative from Capri Apartments said they were uncomfortable commenting on the case but could say “the management company has changed since 2014.”</p>\n<p>Patrick McNicholas, partner of McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, said “the apartment was completely lacking in training its onsite managers in issues of safety, on issues of matching roommates, in issues making sure that the roommates were safe.”</p>\n<p>“The parents are very hopeful their children will not have died in vain,” he said.</p>\n<p>McNicholas also said the parents hope companies with similar business models will take student safety seriously and implement proper policies and procedures to prevent similar events.</p>\n<p>“They’re moving forward with their lives, but they are beyond devastated,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, May 25, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78138\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/suit-against-i-v-shooters-housing-complex-progresses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78138\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/suit-against-i-v-shooters-housing-complex-progresses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/suit-against-i-v-shooters-housing-complex-progresses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/suit-against-i-v-shooters-housing-complex-progresses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/suit-against-i-v-shooters-housing-complex-progresses/","id":4409,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4408,4407,4406],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings-On in I.V.

In the past, winners have been awarded cash prizes ranging from $7,500 to $15,000. This year, the six teams will be competing for a pot of $40,000 in prize money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The teams this year are Collatera, CRYPTIX, Delta Leaf Labs, OrganicMatters, Phanta Field and Wanderlease, each coming off a hard-fought semifinal round held on May 3. Twenty teams participated in the fair, and the best six were chosen to move on to this final round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The finalists were decided by the public who attended the fair, but the winner on Wednesday will be determined by a panel of judges. Here are the six teams competing for the final prize:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collatera, which proposes a better method for diabetes detection and prevention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRYPTIX, which is creating a ticket search engine to eliminate inflated ticket prices and fraud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta Leaf Labs, which aims to mass-produce non-addictive marijuana for medical purposes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OrganicMatters, which looks to partner with the poultry industry and turn their waste products into fertilizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phanta Field, which is trying to create augmented reality glasses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanderlease, which is making an app that aspires to make subleasing easier. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, OSMO won the competition. The four-person team designed a portable water sampling instrument to make it easier for scientists to collect water samples.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They received the first-place prize of $12,000, but all the teams that made it to the finals walked away from the event with cash prizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprisingly, the second-place team walked away with the most amount of money, having additionally been awarded the People’s Choice Award and the Citrix Impact Award. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dave Adornetto, entrepreneurship director for TMP, said there were no major changes this year in terms of format, but there were more people who signed up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s participants have been preparing since the competition started back in November with 38 teams. Throughout Winter Quarter and part of Spring Quarter, the teams have been taking the first few steps on their business models and have been receiving entrepreneurship education in TMP seminars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this preparation will reach its final culmination on Wednesday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Hong, Christopher Michaels-Martinez, David Wang and Veronika Weiss, who lost their lives three years ago in the mass murder that left another 14 injured and countless Isla Vista residents impacted. This year’s graduating seniors will be the last class that attended UC Santa Barbara at the time of the tragedy.</p>\n<p>Many of the victims’ parents were present at the memorial vigil, including the mother of George Chen, Kelly Wang. She said the memory of her son continues to be a “heart-wrenching pain,” but despite the overwhelming sadness, the thought of his kindness has inspired her to “follow the call to serve others” and “discover new meanings” in her own life.</p>\n<p>“In many sleepless nights, I looked at George’s photo, touched his beautiful face with my fingers and I asked myself, ‘What can I do for you George? Is there anything in the world that I can ever do for you?’” Wang said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78088\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78088\" data-attachment-id=\"78088\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-23/over-200-gather-for-memorial-vigil/candlelight-vigil-by-jenny-luo-print-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Candlelight Vigil by Jenny Luo PRINT-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78088\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78088\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“In the silence, I heard a soft little voice came from my own heart.
