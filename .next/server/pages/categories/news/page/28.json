process in each case. <em>Nexus File Photo </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student, referred to in court documents as John Doe, is suing on his own behalf as well as on behalf of all other UC students who were disciplined under several different sexual harassment and sexual violence policies ranging from 2015 to 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policies, according to the lawsuit, include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2015 Interim Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence, implemented on 6/17/2015</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California PACAOS-Appendix-E: Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Student Adjudication Framework, implemented on 1/1/2016</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy, implemented on 1/1/2016 </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Interim Appendix E – Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH) Student Adjudication Framework, implemented on 3/1/2019</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All local University of California campus procedures modeled after the aforementioned system-wide policies</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that the UC Regents uses an investigation model that has been found unlawful in previous court cases, referencing the January 2019 case </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the case, the court ruled that students accused of sexual misconduct in cases where the credibility of witness reports are central to the claim must be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses — either directly or indirectly and in person or through a method like videoconferencing, in front of a neutral judge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the UC’s investigation model, the responsibility for the investigation falls to “a single [Title IX investigator] who acted as police, prosecutor, jury, and judge without a live, in-person hearing before impartial adjudicators where the accused could question or cross-examine the complainant and witnesses,” the suit alleges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC changed its adjudication process in March 2019 after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ruling to comply with the live hearing requirement. On July 31, the UC unveiled a more comprehensive guide to the hearing process, one that is “fair, treats parties with respect and compassion, and results in just and reliable outcomes,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/title-ix/resources/student-adjudication-framework/interim-svhs-student-adjudication-framework-ppt.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July SVSH Student Investigation and Adjudication Framework</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe’s suit represents those who were disciplined under the policies before the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ruling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe’s specific Title IX case began in February 2017, court documents say, when UCLA’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity received a report that Doe had allegedly sexually harassed and stalked another student on multiple occasions between September 2016 and February 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit says Doe cooperated with the school, “meeting with the Title IX investigator several times and providing documents to support his defense that the allegations against him were entirely false.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe alleges that he asked for access to the evidence collected by the investigator but had his requests denied by both the investigator and UCLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that while the investigation “disclosed no direct evidence” of either stalking or sexual harassment, the Title IX investigator concluded there was a “preponderance of evidence” that Doe had engaged in sexual harassment and stalking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCLA Student Conduct Officer then confirmed the Title IX investigator’s findings and suspended Doe for two years. Doe appealed the decision and had his suspension reduced to one year after the appeal body found him responsible of sexual harassment but not stalking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe once again appealed the decision, arguing that “the finding was made in the absence of evidence supporting the elements of sexual harassment in the Policy and the application of a minimum one-year suspension for ‘other sexual contact’ in the absence of any contact whatsoever was improper.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His suspension was reduced to three months, but he was required to reapply to UCLA and “submit documentation of his ability to be a student ‘without engaging in any behavior that would violate university policy.’” He would also be placed on disciplinary probation for the rest of his time at UCLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second proposed class member in the lawsuit, John Doe2, was a graduate student at an unnamed UC campus in 2016 when he was notified in March that the campus’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity had been notified of research misconduct and stalking allegations against him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 was ordered to stay 100 yards from the graduate student he allegedly harassed, and he was restricted from his research. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to Doe’s case, Doe2 alleges that he cooperated with the investigation and provided evidence that proved the allegations against him false, and was also not allowed to see other evidence collected by the investigator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that the investigation “disclosed no direct evidence” of stalking, computer hacking or that “any online accounts were compromised or hacked,” but Doe2 was found guilty of stalking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 says in the suit that there were 113 exhibits of evidence that were not provided to him and 40 unidentified witnesses who were not named, even though he repeatedly requested the evidence and the witness statements, including through the California Public Records Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 was suspended for two years, but he appealed the decision and had his suspension reduced to one year after the appeal body decided he was not responsible for violating the stalking and sexual violence policies, only the physical abuse policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 appealed the decision once again but had his appeal denied. He then filed a writ to “set aside the improper administrative finding that [he] is responsible for a violation of Conduct Policy 102.08 and the one-year suspension.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court ruled in Doe2’s favor, and the university started a new Title IX investigation in December 2018. Doe2 alleges there has been no action from the university since then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC spokesperson Claire Doan said they had not been served with the lawsuit and had no comment at this time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariana Alvarez, Title IX director at UCSB, said she believed the Title IX process offered students due process and declined to comment on the case specifically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Court has reversed three UC Santa Barbara Title IX decisions in the last year, noting a lack of due process in the Title IX process in each case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Judge Donna D.

As many as 28 different types of light bulbs sold at the five major retailers allegedly contain patented technology, according to the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that from 2010 to 2019, researchers at UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) patented a series of four innovations that allowed LED lights to mimic the orange glow of Thomas Edison’s clear incandescent light bulbs without toxic filaments and at a fraction of the cost, according to court documents obtained from Levy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documents, all of which are duplicates save for minor changes, credit three full-time UCSB professors with inventing the patents: James “Jim” Speck, Steven DenBaars and Shuji Nakamura, who was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All are materials professors within the College of Engineering. DenBaars is also an electrical and computer engineering professor, while Nakamura is the solid state lighting and energy center co-director. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakamura did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the alleged patent infringements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joseph “Joe” Incandela, vice chancellor for research at UCSB, said in a statement to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that the unpaid royalties from the retailers in the lawsuit can be put back into “future research, education, and the development of new technologies.” Incandela is also a physics professor at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that the action taken by UC Santa Barbara will underline the importance of respecting the rights of university patent owners,” Incandela said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court complaints note that “substantially all” light fixtures allegedly produced using UCSB’s filament technology are manufactured in China. Target and Walmart had knowledge of patented technology on their shelves as early as December 2017, according to court complaints, when the two stores were sent a “notice of infringement” from the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The strategy has been to reach out directly to the retailers because the products are primarily made overseas, which makes it impractical and difficult for UC to pursue infringement,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, UCSB made efforts to form licensing agreements with retailers outside of court, Levy said, but was stiff-armed by retailers after unsuccessful attempts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Businesses, particularly certain industry sectors like these sorts of consumer products, tend to either ignore or just discount any outreach they have from a university about their need for a license,” Levy said. “They don’t think a university is actually going to enforce those patents, so they just ignore it and carry that risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in 2019, five years after patented products allegedly began saturating the market, UCSB is seeking litigation. The university was hesitant to sue, Levy said: “Litigation, especially of this scale, is a last resort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levy noted that UCSB’s Office of Technology and Industry Alliances made “a lot of efforts to have business conversations with appropriate entities in the lighting industry,” but said they had no luck, and litigation became “necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instances when universities seek legal action over patent rights are rare, Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Until this case, there really are very few examples of universities directly enforcing their patent rights against industry,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s decision to seek litigation comes on the backdrop of a much larger issue in which the threat of stolen knowledge is constantly looming, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a systemic problem … It’s important for academic institutions to have tools like this available to them to make sure their rights are respected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB is successful in court, the money would be split three ways between Longford Capital — a litigation firm working with the university — SSLEEC researchers responsible for the patents and UCSB itself, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-30/uc-santa-barbara-sues-led-lightbulbs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomberg reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

called for an increase in pay and employee benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming weeks, UPTE will have the opportunity to formally ratify both contracts, focusing

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the agreement, Peter Chester, executive director of labor relations for the UC, said the UC is “pleased” with the new agreements which will grant employees “competitive pay” and “excellent benefits.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the press release, the tentative agreements entail a 20% “across the board” increase in pay for health care professionals, and a 22% increase in pay for research and technical professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of retirement benefits, the press release states that new UC employees will be eligible for “the same pension benefits as current UPTE-represented employees” until 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health care, research and technical professionals will also benefit from no retirement cuts, no “dangerous” pension drop out, overtime for over eight hours and double overtime after twelve hours, according to the </span><a href=\"http://www.upte.org/local/new/congrats-ta/\"><span

I was lucky enough to get it, and I’m happy to be on it,” Griffin said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the newest member of the board, one of Griffin’s first goals is to renovate two of the parks in I.V.: Walter Capps Park and Pardall Gardens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin said Walter Capps Park, a large tract of dirt and grass located oceanside at the beginning of the 67 block of Del Playa Drive, has recently been discussed as a site for renovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been in the talks recently to put together a plan to build a park there and to have different facilities like work-out stations and shade structures. So I’d like to be a part of the design of that which will be happening hopefully within the next year,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also wants to renovate Pardall Gardens, which neighbors Lao Wang on Pardall Road and currently houses a few benches and sparse shrubbery. Griffin wants to “transition the park to become a space utilized by students and community members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is also looking forward to the implementation of the first solar table at the southeast corner of People’s Park. The solar table will house outlets charged by solar panels and was a project initially started in the EVPLA office under Jeike Meijer, who served as EVPLA for the 2018-19 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The foundation has been laid, and the table will hopefully be installed and ready by Fall Quarter 2019, according to Griffin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To familiarize himself with the IVRPD’s revenue, Griffin said he intends to join the Finance Committee. Soutar and Bernard are the current directors on the committee; Bernard replaced Washington following her resignation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I want] to figure out exactly where the tax revenues come from and how to maintain the balance budget that we’ve had recently for the next few years going forward,” Griffin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to be able to learn how to manage and still provide very good resources for our community but still maintain that healthy side of the financials.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside working on financials within the IVRPD, Griffin also wants to collaborate with the EVPLA office and the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) on future projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He hopes to spread awareness about I.V.’s history by creating a timeline of I.V.’s history in the new community center — which is set to have a soft opening in August — in order to create a stronger connection between the long-term residents and students.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [July 31, 12:30 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Matthew Griffin had said “stage structures” instead of “shade structures” in regards to Walter Capps Park.

<em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Alcocer, associate vice president of the Budget Analysis and Planning office, led the discussion around the possibility of cohort-based tuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Cohort-based tuition] could benefit students and institutions alike,” he said during the meeting, pointing out that the practice has “been adopted by a number of public universities in other states” but that it has never been done on “as large a scale as we are discussing today.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To better implement the plan, Alcocer said the UC Office of The President (UCOP) reached out to universities that have implemented cohort-based tuition to learn what works and what doesn’t, stating that universities must have stable revenue streams from state funds, tuition and investments in order to reach their principle goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also pointed out that the tuition changes could be “pegged to the rate of inflation” so that the tuition would remain flat at “constant dollars,” meaning the purchasing power of the cost remains the same throughout each year, but the cash amount goes up with inflation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan Brostrom, executive vice president of the UC Office of the Chief Financial Officer, said there are numerous decisions involved with the change, such as deciding whether the approach would be for both undergraduate and graduate students, whether the plan should include just base tuition or other fees as well and how long a cohort should be defined as, noting that many low-income students take longer to complete their degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When phasing in cohort-based tuition, the tuition increases would ideally be tied to inflation but would affect only a quarter of the students at the beginning, “so you might have to do a slightly higher increase in the beginning to make up for that lost revenue,” Brostrom said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recalling numerous protests over tuition hikes, Regent Sherry Lansing said that it was not necessarily the tuition hike that caused an outcry but rather inconsistency in the tuition hikes, referencing the</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_California_college_tuition_hike_protests\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2009 Occupy protests. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lansing stated that she has never seen the Regents want to increase tuition, but by not raising tuition, universities often have to cut programs and limit their growth in response to shortfalls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems to me that this is a perfect time to discuss this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice Chair Cecilia Estolano explained that for the plan to be successful, the UC would need the California state legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to both be fully on board with the plan in addition to maintaining the UC’s goals. UC’s </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/uc-2030-dashboard\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goals for 2030</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are to award upwards of 1 million degrees, close the achievement gap and add 1,100 professor positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that having a steady revenue for the UC would be necessary to maintain the cohort-tuition approach. Estolano continued by noting that unexpected pitfalls in funding are a guarantee going forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know there will be a recession. We know there will be pressure, so we need to have some other mechanism to still achieve these goals,” Estolano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Regent Lark Park, the issue came down to, “How do we fund the university we want?” He said that if the Regents approach this model, they need to look deeply into where the UC’s money comes from before going forward with any plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been very clear from the conversation that we cannot look at this as a singular question but how it relates to other issues, raised with respect to what kind of university we want to build,” Regent Chair John Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In closing the discussion, Napolitano said that a working group has been formed to research the topic, consisting of Chair Perez, Regent Maria Anguiano, Student Regent Hayley Weddle and UC Vice Chair of the Academic Senate Kum-Kum Bhavnani. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We obviously have a lot of work to do,” Napolitano said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in the Freshman Summer Start Program (FSSP) ⁠— a program that allows first-year UCSB students the chance to move in early and take one session of summer classes with the aim of easing them into UCSB ⁠— have historically lived in San Nicolas Hall, and in recent years, have stayed in that hall for their entire first year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year, 100 slots in San Miguel Hall, San Nicholas’ neighbor, will be open to FSSP students who are interested in moving into another residence hall during the school year. Those 100 students will live in San Miguel during the summer and move into one of the other six residence halls ⁠— Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Manzanita Village, Santa Catalina, San Rafael or Santa Cruz ⁠—  once Fall Quarter 2019 begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change, said William Jankowski, associate director of UCSB’s Residential &amp; Community Living, was made so that students who wanted to live in other residence halls would still be able to participate in FSSP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jankowski explained that every year, his department receives requests from FSSP students to live in residence halls other than San Nicholas for the academic year, particularly from students wanting to room with individuals who are not in FSSP and who are living in other residence halls. Non-FSSP students typically move into different residence halls the week before Fall Quarter 2019 begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the past, students have had to choose [between FSSP and their friends],” Jankowski said.  “We’re excited this year that we can allow students to move into a different residence hall after FSSP, and opening up FSSP to San Miguel allows us to do this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While students in FSSP are typically known for remaining together in San Nicolas for the entire year, this change is not unprecedented, according to Gallucci. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the program first began in 2002 with 210 students, most students moved out of San Nicolas for the following fall quarter. The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ultimate goal was to fill both San Nicolas and San Miguel with 800 to 1000 students for the summer, who would then move to different residence halls in the fall, he explained. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Gallucci said that “around six or seven years ago,” Housing &amp; Residential Services changed the program to keep students together in San Nicolas for the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They wanted to try a different system, thinking that perhaps living together for a whole year would consolidate those friendships,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the program has grown over the past 17 years, with a projected total of 540 students this year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">number on par with last year’s cohort of 540, which was about 10% of the class of 2022 ⁠— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the UCSB Summer Sessions office and Housing &amp; Residential Services have worked together closely to accommodate the program’s growing popularity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s slow going, because it’s hard to convince all the students that this is such a good program, because a lot of students think it’s academic boot camp,” Gallucci said. “They don’t realize how fun it can be as well. Our students have the highest GPA of any group on campus, 3.57 this past summer … they graduate at triple, sometimes quadruple, the rate of non-FSSP cohorts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gallucci calls this year’s expansion to San Miguel a “test year.” Both Gallucci and UCSB’s Housing &amp; Residential Services hope that more FSSP students will be able to live in San Miguel as the program continues to grow in the coming years. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Kundu wrote a scathing response, and, not knowing what to do with his paper, began sending it to various professors at several American universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To his surprise, some professors got back to him and liked what he had written. At the end of a reply, one professor even invited Kundu to apply for graduate school and study under him in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That professor was Mattison Mines, who taught anthropology at UCSB from 1970 to 2005. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I pinched myself,” Kundu said, recalling the invitation from Mines. “He is my guru.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Kundu arrived in Santa Barbara for graduate school in 1982, he was primarily interested in the modernization of agriculture, population studies and the Green Revolution in India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until Kundu was fully immersed in the environmental studies circles at UCSB that he began to see the darker sides of what he was studying — how human behavior and modern agriculture were negatively affecting the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Mankind’s] connection to environmental degradation … I had no idea until I came here. At the time, that conversation was not happening in India. Everyone was still thinking of how good the Green Revolution was, thinking they had found the solution,” Kundu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the late 1980s, nearing the completion of his Ph.D., Kundu applied for a lecturer position in the environmental studies department and was subsequently accepted. However, he realized that he hadn’t quite considered the dilemma of whether to return to India or stay in the United States. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had no interest in leaving India permanently. My parents were there, my in-laws, my wife. But I couldn’t leave Santa Barbara either. I fell in love. It is this lifelong love with this campus, its students, its faculty members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To resolve his problem, Kundu worked out a deal with the department to teach only a couple quarters a year, eventually transitioning to only teaching in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s first official quarter teaching at UCSB was the winter of 1988. He hasn’t stopped since. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This summer marks his 32nd consecutive year of returning to Santa Barbara from India to teach both environmental studies and anthropology classes including Environmental Studies 132: Human Behavior and Global Environment and Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s interest in anthropology and the environment began in ninth grade after he attended a village boarding school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There, I came to know the villagers, the farmers. I was born in a city and I had never seen a paddy field before,” Kundu said. “I noticed that these families had a different culture, and I became interested in their lives, the farmers’ lives. It made a deep impact on me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu was one of the early scholars to approach environmental studies from an anthropological perspective, looking at how the development of human societies and cultures is affecting the environment today. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu wants students to understand that “our own consumption is at the root of the environmental crisis,” noting that during a flight from Japan to the U.S., he received a bottle of water from the Swiss Alps. He lamented the use of resources required to bring the water from Switzerland to Japan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is the purpose? Was there water scarcity in Japan? I did some research, and no, there’s no water scarcity. The airline wanted to show that they cared about us or something like that. Yet what is the impact? Unless we understand this, we will not be able to change it. Technology is only part of the solution. We need a behavioral solution as well. A change in perspective. That is my key message for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year biological anthropology major Ana Perez, who is currently taking Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology with Kundu, said she appreciates the substance and methodology of Professor Kundu’s teaching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “When he talked about being one of the first people to actually consider putting environmental studies and anthropology together… I didn’t even think of putting those two together. I hope that more people taking his classes decide to pursue environmental anthropology,” Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s awesome that he travels the world for this, and I wish more people had the opportunity to take his courses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Kundu is grateful for his unique career, it is not without downsides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you have two homes, you are always homesick,” Kundu said. While in Santa Barbara, it is hard not to miss his wife and family in India. However, he said that friends like Debjani Bhattacharya, a financial analyst at UCSB’s Earth Research Institute, help with that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really, wherever you go outside of India, there will be an Indian diaspora. We met here 17 years ago through a group of friends,” Bhattacharya said. It just so happened that the two were born and raised in the same state in India, West Bengal, and attended the same university for their undergraduate studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we go back to India, we visit each other’s families, and we have become family friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two friends, along with other colleagues, like to get together to cook traditional Indian meals and take walks on Del Playa Drive. Once, during an evening Del Playa walk, some students approached their group and asked Kundu if he was the chancellor of UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without skipping a beat, Kundu replied, “Not yet.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for what the future holds for Kundu, he welcomes more of the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Teaching is my religion. It’s not just my profession.
