The discussion touched on a variety of topics relating to cannabis, but primarily served as an additional step in the community involvement process leading to the opening of a dispensary in I.V. in about a year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two speakers were UCSB alumni Lauren Vazquez, a lawyer specializing in cannabis law, and Devon Wardlow, director of public affairs for Santa Barbara cannabis retailer Coastal Dispensary. They spoke extensively about cannabis use in I.V., noting that the next step toward bringing a recreational dispensary in I.V. is through community outreach.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vasquez explained that because the licensing process in I.V. for recreational dispensaries is ranked, community impact counts as the second most important factor in the ranking process. The financial viability of the business is ranked first, but Santa Barbara County is using a merit-based system to determine which businesses get the recreational marijuana licenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county will be holding a meeting in I.V. within the coming months to gauge input from the community — specifically what residents would like out of a local dispensary and how the dispensary would contribute to improving the community, according to Vazquez. The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for the end of April, according to Gina Fischer, an aide to Santa Barbara county supervisor Joan Hartmann.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow said that Coastal Dispensary, which already has locations in Lompoc, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara, is going to compete for the spot in I.V. and is putting together a community benefits package for the dispensary’s pitch based off of the feedback she gets from talking to I.V. residents. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You guys have a ton of power in ensuring that somebody that comes to this community actually represents your community, and it’s actually going to do something helpful for you,” she said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow said she couldn’t discuss certain details of the potential community benefits package due to the ongoing licensing process, but added that she believes a dispensary could benefit the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The way I would propose it is that a portion of the cannabis taxes and revenue that comes from this store is funneled back into Isla Vista versus going into the general fund at the county,” Wardlow said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Wardlow acknowledged that appropriating the dispensary’s funds away from the county and into the I.V. CSD would be difficult, and that all current plans Coastal Dispensary has regarding its community benefits package are subject to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said that he can not comment on any ideas from the competing dispensaries regarding their community benefits packages, he added that he believes that the upcoming cannabis store will aid I.V.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’ll be a huge benefit to the community to have an additional revenue source because that’s money that should go right back into things that will fund our community facilities and programming for students and residents, our roads, sidewalks and street lights and our local schools,” Brandt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ellie Hurtado, a fourth-year communication major and president of SSDP, said that she’d like the tax revenue from a dispensary to go toward helping I.V. families, as well as students who experience food and housing insecurity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she would like to see more money for local youth programs such as the St. George Youth Center YMCA.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hurtado noted that while recreational cannabis is both legal and accessible for Isla Vistans who are 21 years old and older, with many residents ordering from dispensaries in Goleta and downtown Santa Barbara, the primary impact of a local dispensary would be the tax revenue it generates. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista has the opportunity through the county to be a really shining star in a larger ecosystem that is the central coast cannabis industry,” Wardlow said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Room and board estimates for this school year dipped slightly from $15,273 to $15,111 due to the estimates being based on UCSB-owned housing costs rather than the commercial rental market.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The total amount for student financial aid in 2019-20 was $448,450,248, averaging out to $23,336 per student, a slight increase from the last school year. For undergraduates, 65% of their aid came from grants, while 89% of graduate student aid came from fellowships. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">73% of students at UCSB this year received some form of financial aid through the university, but 97% of graduate students received aid compared to 70% of undergraduates.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As in previous years, physical and biological sciences was the largest major discipline, encompassing 46% of all undergraduates and 35% of all graduate students. Social and cultural studies contained 33% of all undergraduates; languages, humanities and arts had 13%; interdisciplinary/unknown undergraduates had 8% and engineering/computer science had 7%. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For graduate students, engineering/computer science was the second most popular field with 26%, followed by languages, humanities and arts with 16%, social and cultural studies with 13%, education with 8% and interdisciplinary/unknown with 3%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">38% of UCSB students live in university-owned housing and 34% live in Isla Vista, with the rest of the student population living in Santa Barbara, Goleta or other locations.

He added that UCGPC performs systemwide and statewide advocacy and often works with the UC Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President (UCOP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strobel said that the timing of the UCOP’s </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-napolitano-s-statement-her-invitation-meet-graduate-and-professional-council\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Friday, combined with language that alluded to the potential discussion of a COLA, led some groups such as UCSC’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) to feel as if the UC was trying to circumvent ongoing demands for a COLA from organizers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strobel described the incident as a “misunderstanding” and said that UCGPC meets with Napolitano on a yearly basis, and, after its meeting in January 2020, UCGPC wanted to follow up with Napolitano on a handful of other issues. On Friday, Strobel said he was contacted by UCOP to meet again, to which UCGPC agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first discussion item listed in the UCOP press release was “cost of living,” followed by “housing.” Strobel maintained, however, that the meeting will not be about discussing a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The whole genesis of a potential board meeting with [Napolitano] and her team was to talk about state advocacy and some of the issues facing graduate students,” Strobel said. “But we’re not negotiating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And that’s a sentiment she also expressed to me,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students across the UC system have now begun organizing for COLAs of their own, and at UC Santa Cruz, where graduate students have been on a formal strike since Feb. 10, they have withheld Fall Quarter 2019 grades as part of a wildcat strike. Last Friday, around 500 UC Santa Barbara graduate students </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marched</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the University Library to Cheadle Hall, where they occupied the space from 8 a.m. to midnight in solidarity with UCSC graduate students who were given a midnight deadline on Feb. 21 to end their strike and submit the grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of today, UCSC graduate students are still on strike, as the original Feb. 21 “doomsday” deadline to submit Fall Quarter 2019 grades was extended to Feb. 27, according to an email sent to faculty and graduate students from Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the UCOP press release sent out on Friday, UCSC’s GSA sent an email to Napolitano, noting that UCSC does not have any representation on the council that she would be meeting with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For many reasons including, but not limited to, the fact that [UCGPC] does not represent our campus in any leadership or representational capacity, we are sorry to inform you that any decisions at which you may collectively arrive will not impact our organizing or our conviction,” the UCSC GSA wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, Cierra Sorin, president of UCSB’s GSA, said that the UCOP’s press release announcing a meeting with UCGPC was “uninspiring.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I don’t agree with that decision to reach out to UCGPC necessarily, since they have been pretty anti-COLA, I think it makes sense from a bureaucratic perspective,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Sorin said she doubted that UCGPC will specifically discuss a COLA at their meeting, she commented on UCGPC’s previous meeting at UCSB in early January, where she said “most of the folks in that room were anti-COLA.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite Sorin’s comments, Strobel said that UCGPC’s role is unrelated to the COLA movement. UCGPC is trying to alleviate rent burden through other measures, he said, such as reducing the cost of living for graduate students rather than advocating for a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve tried to go about it both in the the cost mitigating way, which is sort of open turf, like anyone can work on it,” Strobel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then in terms of increasing pay, that’s a little more of a complicated dance because you have other stakeholders who have been working on the issue for a long time, who have the legal first dibs to it, like the union, in which case we played an important, coalitionary partner to some of those folks,” he continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW 2865), the union that represents UC student workers at the bargaining table, UCGPC is a form of student of student government that describes its role as “complementary” to unions, according to the statement, and plans to continue advocating to “reduce the financial burden” of graduate students’ living expenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the midst of an ongoing battle between graduate students and the UC, Strobel asserted that UCGPC has no plan to negotiate a COLA in its upcoming meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do think it was an honest misunderstanding,” he said.   </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

developed across the UC system. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vote for a full strike comes three days after graduate students </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">occupied Cheadle Hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for 16 hours on Friday, demanding that Chancellor Henry T. Yang email UCSC administrators and UC President Janet Napolitano to “denounce threats” of firing against graduate students at UCSC and call for system-wide cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) negotiations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA movements have popped up at every UC campus except for UC San Francisco, but the amount students are asking for varies from campus to campus depending on local housing costs. UCSB 4 COLA is calling for a monthly amount </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,807.51</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which would be given to all graduate students regardless of individual salary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although housing costs have been an issue in Santa Cruz for years, UCSC brought the discussion of a COLA to the forefront starting in September 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After delivering COLA demands to administrators in November, UCSC graduate students began a partial strike in early December by withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades, which at least 85 graduate students still have not submitted, according to a UCSC Graduate Student Association (GSA) email sent to UCSC graduate students on Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest points of tension between administrators and strikers is the withheld grades, for which graduate students at UCSC have been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/janet-napolitano-ucsc-administration-warn-of-termination-to-striking-ucsc-graduate-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent termination warning letters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. UCSC Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer gave UCSC strikers a deadline of Friday at midnight to turn in grades and end their strike, but the graduate students voted at a meeting late Friday night to continue striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer sent an email Monday morning to UCSC faculty “to clarify that fall-grade submission … will be verified on Thursday, Feb. 27,” a change from the previous Feb. 21 deadline set by Kletzer to submit grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC GSA wrote in an email to graduate students that they </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider [themselves] terminated from [their] employment” and that as of Monday morning, 351 graduate workers have committed to withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades and several departments have committed to refusing Spring Quarter 2020 appointments if striking graduate students have their spring appointments revoked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Friday occupation of Cheadle Hall was organized in solidarity with the “doomsday strike” at UCSC, the name being coined due to the termination warnings and midnight deadline from administrators. Across the UC system, graduate students on almost </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/skamidi/status/1230910763281211392\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> held a demonstration, rally or other action in support of the UCSC strikers on Friday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC strike </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— and the imminent UCSB strike — is a wildcat strike, meaning that graduate students are acting separate from United Auto Workers Union 2865 (UAW 2865), the union that represents graduate students UC-wide. The current UAW 2865 contract extends until 2022, and a clause in the </span><a href=\"https://uaw2865.org/know-your-rights/contract/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contract states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “there shall be no strikes, stoppages or interruptions of work” while the contract is still active.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW 2865 </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQnj7hw2866SMHQiNM_NH1TWZQPm-cfG4CzlyohAl6s/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formally asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the UC to meet them at the bargaining table to negotiate a COLA for its members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cost of living concerns have consistently been a high priority for academic student employees, and we have bargained over these matters in every set of contract negotiations at the systemwide table since 2000,” UAW 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar wrote to Peter Chester, executive director of labor relations within UCOP. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe both the Union and the University have an interest in ameliorating the economic hardships faced by its academic student employees who face some of the most high-rent cities in the city and country, and welcome sitting down to negotiate over these matters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students have been organizing for a COLA since December, but most of the movement’s initial actions were in solidarity with the striking UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actions at UCSB began with a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-12-14/in-photos-ucsb-rallies-in-solidarity-with-ucsc-graduate-students/\">solidarity rally</a> in December and with a </span><a style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/ucsb-grad-students-hold-demonstration-in-solidarity-with-uc-santa-cruz-over-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">“sick-out”</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January, when approximately 150 graduate students, faculty and undergraduates marched from Storke Tower to the Arbor to coincide with the UC Regents meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers officially </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delivered</span></a> <a href=\"https://ucsb4cola.org/demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a COLA on Feb. 10 to Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall at Cheadle Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to calling for a COLA of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,807.51</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> per month, organizers demanded that the COLA payments do not come from “an increase in undergraduate or graduate tuition, campus fees, or university-owned housing rent.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers also emphasized that the university “must not retaliate in any form, implicit or explicit, against graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, or any other individuals who support and/or participate in the struggle for a COLA, regardless of citizenship or visa status.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands also say that the COLA must be adjusted from year-to-year depending on inflation, and that the university should further accommodate graduate students with dependents who might have additional financial needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We fight for a COLA not just for ourselves, but as part of a larger struggle for a dignified life for all at the university,” UCSB 4 COLA wrote in its demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A COLA is more than just a raise: it is a structural commitment by the institution, recognizing that this university would not function without graduate student labor.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers within the UCSB 4 COLA movement have emphasized the importance of undergraduate and faculty solidarity and have been circulating petitions calling on both of them to support the movement. As of Monday evening, the UCSB </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUmm9MGeuBLXATdthTtvQBxX4rBUuN47emBOqQwxskIOuisg/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">faculty support petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had received 123 signatures, and the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwc6XltN-1Yp6LEfO1GdZX7SDKnhgC583DhcQ4_YA_PplfRQ/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">undergraduate petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had received 467, according to GSA President Cierra Sorin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past two weeks, organizers at UCSC have emphasized to COLA groups on other campuses the importance of taking further action and following them to strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In UCSB 4 COLA’s General Assembly meeting on Feb. 20, Jane Komori, one of the lead graduate student organizers at UCSC, spoke directly to UCSB graduate students about the need for striking beyond Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After UCSC, UCSB’s movement is the most developed across the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Other UC campuses are looking to Santa Barbara and taking inspiration in what you’re doing,” Komori said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We at Santa Cruz are staking a lot on your next moves,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Feb. 25, 1:04 p.m.]: Demands for a COLA at UCSB began in December, not January.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; outsourcing has been a point of contention between the UC and its unions in the past. In May 2019, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, the UC’s largest union, went on a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/afscme-announces-strike-over-outsourcing-unfair-labor-practices/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one-day strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over outsourcing concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the new guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new guidelines build upon the original UC Regents motion from November and hinge on the practice of insourcing, which is when “[outside] service contracts are terminated or not renewed, and the work is transferred to UC employees,” according to the guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered services — contracted labor typically performed by union employees — are at the center of the new guidelines. According to the guidelines, the UC hopes to insource “to the fullest extent possible” moving forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To determine if a covered service is eligible for insourcing, the guidelines say the UC must consider “equipment needed to perform the service,” “technical skills or expertise required to perform the service” and the “law, Federal requirement, contract or grant requirement, or court decisions or orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the guidelines say the UC must notify AFSCME when a UC campus is ready “to transition contracted covered service work.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the guidelines, only certain types of covered services can continue to be outsourced, namely when it is “required by law, Federal requirement, contract or grant requirement, or court decisions or orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC deems an outsourced covered service necessary, the guidelines mandate that UC employees cannot be displaced as a result and that “any proposed contract for Covered Services that would result in displacement must be canceled.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guidelines also explain how the UC will accommodate insourced covered service workers by providing them with the matching wages — $15 an hour or more — and benefits of university employees. According to the guidelines, the UC Systemwide Human Resources office will determine the wage and benefit parity on a yearly basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to covered service workers, the guidelines also explain how the UC should go about insourcing supplier employees, which are contractors employed by the UC to perform a specific type of work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To become insourced as a “UC career employee,” the guidelines say supplier employees must be eligible to work in the U.S., pass a background check and perform the same services at the same campus for 1,000 hours over a 12-month period or for “35% time over” a 36-month period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If AFSCME determines that a pending contract for covered services doesn’t comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the UC, the union has up to 14 calendar days to file a grievance with UCOP, according to the guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, the guidelines say UCOP has 10 days to respond to the grievance; if UCOP denies the grievance, AFSCME can file an “appeal to arbitration” within 10 days of receiving UCOP’s response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of an appeal, the guidelines say that an arbitrator will determine whether or not the UC’s pending contract for the covered service is appropriate. If it is appropriate, the contract will remain in place; if it isn’t, the contract must be terminated and the university must “stop the contracting process,” the guidelines read. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Besides the noon rally, the fifth floor occupation remained relatively uneventful, with organizers even setting up a projector to watch “The Matrix” later in the evening.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several undergraduates who attended sections at Cheadle Hall said that they were in support of the COLA movement and their TAs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The TAs are being exploited right now. There’s definitely some unfair practices happening around the fact that the UC Regents refuse to discuss it; it’s pretty disappointing,” said Kate Ripley, a first-year psychological and brain sciences major who was there to attend her Feminist Studies 30 section.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In college, I’ve noticed in all of my classes that I don’t get nearly as much instruction from professors as I do from the TAs. The TAs are there to talk to you personally. The TAs are always there for you,” said Jamie Donofrio, a second-year computer science major. “They need to live, and that’s kind of a thing where if a person needs to live, we need to be there to support them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Ripley’s perspective, the themes of Feminist Studies 30, which including unfair labor practices and exploitation, are relatable to COLA movements across the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just find it very disappointing that in this situation, the graduate students have been kind of villainized and made to seem that they’re asking for too much or asking for more than others, when they’re just asking for enough to survive,” Ripley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially with the police force that was used at Santa Cruz, it is just really disappointing. As someone who is paying tuition, I know my tuition is going towards police brutality, and that is really frustrating.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both at the noon rally and throughout the day at Cheadle Hall, COLA organizers emphasized the importance of undergraduate support, encouraging them to attend COLA meetings and bring their friends. On Tuesday, COLA organizers created an </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwc6XltN-1Yp6LEfO1GdZX7SDKnhgC583DhcQ4_YA_PplfRQ/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">undergraduate petition of support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which has already received hundreds of signatures in the past three days, according to Emily, a graduate student involved in COLA organizing who preferred not to give her last name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email to the Nexus, Yang noted that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate Dean Carol Genetti and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn invited COLA organizers and the executive leadership of the UCSB GSA to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss “the concerns of graduate students broadly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our campus has long had a culture of working collaboratively with our students to address concerns and provide support.

I think UC bureaucracy is trying to keep this limited to a single campus because then they think they can quell the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that, from her perspective, the representatives of UCGPC are “anti-COLA” and don’t represent the feelings of UC graduate students as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I guess my question at the end of the day would be why would she talk to COLA if she doesn’t want to legitimize the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC’s GSA sent an email to Napolitano, the UCSC administration and UCSC graduate students in response to Napolitano’s statement, noting that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC has nothing to do with the COLA campaign [and] has refused contact since its inception.” They added that there is no UCSC representation on that council. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kavitha Iyengar, the president of UAW Local 2865, issued a statement earlier this morning echoing Sorin’s concerns about Napolitano’s invitation to UCGPC, saying the council did not “have legal authority to bargain on the workers’ behalf.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Conflating COLA negotiations with UCGPC’s other advocacy efforts is an attempt to buy time and deflate the energy of this movement — and it will not work,” Iyengar wrote, adding that UAW Local 2865 had </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQnj7hw2866SMHQiNM_NH1TWZQPm-cfG4CzlyohAl6s/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formally asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the UC to bargain with the union for a COLA in Janaury. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB 4 COLA plans to hold a General Assembly meeting on Monday at 6 p.m. in the MultiCultural Center, where they intend to discuss their actions moving forward and prepare for the Tuesday meeting with administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think in part some of that is going to be determined by what is happening at Santa Cruz come Monday morning,” Sorin said. “If folks are receiving termination letters, that may escalate things here faster, it may not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a collective movement and we are really doing our best to ensure that we are not making decisions without as many voices as possible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Sorin said she was “floored” by the response on Friday, particularly from undergraduates and faculty, and hopes to continue building a UCSB coalition moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been here for five years. I’ve never felt this level of community with grad students, let alone with the rest of my campus.

</span><em>Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But collecting this data involves a large amount of behind-the-scenes work to keep it running from decade to decade. To help students at UC Santa Barbara understand how the census works, U.S. Census Bureau Media Specialist Vanessa Moreno sat down with the Nexus to speak about how exactly collecting population data at UCSB and in I.V. works. Moreno specializes in dispelling misconceptions around the census and providing citizens a solid foundation for understanding how it works.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first U.S. Census was administered in 1790, and one has followed every 10 years since that time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The census also determines congressional apportionments for the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We allocate over $675 billion each year across the country for services … things that everyone’s going to use at one point or another. That’s why it’s really important to get a fair and accurate count of everyone,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of methods the U.S. Census Bureau employs to get an accurate count of the population, which depend on the living situation of those being counted. For those who live in residences such as houses or apartments, the occupants of each space are invited to respond to the census via the phone, mail or online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll send mail out invitation[s] to respond in mid-March. It’ll be a letter, and it will be addressed to the residence, not the residents, not the actual people living there,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, reminders will be sent to those who have not yet responded. If all else fails, an enumerator, a representative of the U.S. Census Bureau tasked with interviewing non-responses, will be sent to a residence in a last-ditch effort to obtain a proper count for the residence, according to Moreno. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get an accurate number of students living in residence halls or university apartments, the U.S. Census Bureau will instead contact the university directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Any students that live in the dorms or student apartments don’t have to take the census themselves because we [have] already contacted or we are contacting [university] administrators and asking them how many people live there,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who do not have a permanent residence, census enumerators must take a more active role in obtaining a count. First, Moreno said, representatives will be sent to service-based localities such as soup kitchens or homeless shelters, where they will contact those who head those services to obtain a count of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After, she said the U.S. Census Bureau will have people go to other locations, such as freeway underpasses or encampments, and do a physical count of how many people live there over a three-day period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process takes months, and the results of the census are compiled and delivered to the president in December, with the results available to the public in early 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno also noted that those working with the U.S. Census Bureau must take an oath of confidentiality before carrying out any tasks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will never tell, for example, your landlord that you have more people living there than you should have. That’s not something we can or would do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take a lifetime oath to protect people’s information. And if we ever were to break that oath, we are subject to a $250,000 fine or five years in prison,” Moreno said. “So no one is too eager to break that oath.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno also addressed a point of controversy that has sparked criticism of the census in recent times. In </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/trump-census-citizenship-question.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Trump administration attempted to add a citizenship question to the census, but Moreno emphasized that the addition in question was struck down and will not be on the 2020 census.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no fear necessary when filling out the census,” Moreno said. “[People’s] information is safe and protected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because I.V. is a college town with residents who often move and may not be aware of how the census is carried out — or what relevance it has to their community— Moreno said there is some likelihood of an undercount.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno went over a number of risk factors that could lead to this outcome, including the tendency for parents to include their children as residents in their household while the children are actually living at college, as well as resident fears that information obtained by the U.S. Census Bureau will be used against them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequences of an undercount are significant, Moreno said, noting it can result in inaccurate apportionment in the House of Representatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is the risk of California losing a seat in Congress,” Moreno said, adding that impacts to federal funding could also be severe, depending on the magnitude of the undercount.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basically any social service that you can think of could be affected if people don’t make themselves count, and there’s no way to reassess the census once it’s been done until the next census,” Moreno said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is estimated that for every person that [isn’t counted] about $2,000 per year are lost from funding. Let’s say 100 people don’t answer. That’s like $200,000,” she said. “Then you multiply it by 10 years and it’s like $2 million.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Carbajal is running for a third term re-election for the seat he first won in 2016. He currently serves on the House Committee on Armed Services, the House Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, of which he serves as the vice chair. Carbajal has sponsored 231 bills since his inauguration in 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UCSB graduate, Carbajal previously served for 12 years as the Santa Barbara County 1st District Supervisor. One of Carbajal’s main issues is environmental protection; he serves on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate Solutions Caucus, which aims to find bipartisan solutions for mitigating the effects of climate change. Carbjal has also been a strong supporter of pro-immigration legislation, fighting against the Trump administration’s decision to terminate DACA. </span></p>\n<p><b>Andrew Caldwell (Republican):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Caldwell’s campaign is centered on providing better opportunities for workers and small businesses. In 1991, he founded the Coalition of Labor, Agriculture and Business (COLAB), which now has 1,000 members in Santa Barbara County. He has also helped start similar COLAB groups in Imperial, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties. While Caldwell is running as a Republican, he told the Santa Maria Times in February that neither party is serving the needs of the people and that he would “represent the people here.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Kenneth Young (No Party Preference): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young’s background is in civil engineering. According to his website, two issues that prompted him to run for office are health care and tax issues. He believes that Congress needs to lower costs for working families in order to maintain a healthy workforce in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue Young has put at the forefront of his campaign is energy independence; he said he believes the United States should invest more funding in renewable energy research and find safer ways of dealing with nuclear waste rather than eliminating nuclear power altogether. </span></p>\n<h2><b>State Assembly:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Charles W. Cole (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cole, the sole Republican candidate running for State Assembly and the youngest among all candidates at 22, is running on a conservative platform that includes fixing freeways, preserving Proposition 13, maintaining private health care and rolling back rent control, according to his campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born and raised in Santa Barbara, Cole graduated from Santa Barbara High School and attended Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) to study business, but left after his first year after he found “the PC culture not conducive to learning,” according to his campaign website. His father manages his campaign, which has roughly $10,000 in donations from friends and family. He currently works for a local PR business, according to a Noozhawk</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Elsa Granados (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados, executive director of the nonprofit Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, is running on a three-fold platform that includes social equality advocacy, women’s rights advocacy and preserving the environment and coastlines along the Central Coast, according to her campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If she wins the seat, Granados told the Santa Maria Times that she would work to increase affordable housing, create more jobs, strengthen the education systems within the district and stop offshore drilling.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Abboud (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A longtime UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista community member,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud, the youngest Democrat in the race for assembly, is the current general manager for the Isla Vista Community Services District and board member on the SBCC Board of Trustees.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud is running on a platform of education reform and free tuition, universal health care, affordable housing and public transportation, criminal justice reform and support for indigeneous communities, according to his campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cathy Murillo (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current Santa Barbara City mayor, a former journalist and city councilmember, Murillo is running on a platform that aims to preserve the environment, increase access to higher education and strengthen the middle class, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first term as the mayor of Santa Barbara, Murillo worked to ban single-use plastics, set a 100% renewable energy goal by 2030 and continued to employ integrated pest management in the city. She also negotiated a project labor agreement with the city for worker safety and fair pay, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Jason Dominguez (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez is bringing his experience as an environmental lawyer and a former teacher to his campaign, advocating for greater response to climate change, according to his website. Dominguez has previously served as a Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney and Deputy City Attorney, and he has been on Santa Barbara City Council since 2015. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez was originally running for Assembly at the same time as re-election for the Santa Barbara City Council but lost the election in December 2019. If elected, he plans to expand his work from City Council on inclusionary housing and wants to create a rent-to-own program for tenants. </span></p>\n<p><b>Steve Bennett (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Supervisor Bennett is finishing his fifth term on the board; before that, he worked as a high school teacher and member of the Ventura City Council. One of his hallmark initiatives of the County Board of Supervisors is S.O.A.R., the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources initiative, which was recently re-ratified. Other key issues for Bennett include building affordable housing and alternative transportation, such as coastal bikeways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bennett recently received the endorsement of the Santa Barbara Independent, who said he “holds the dramatic edge of experience” and will advocate for environmental protection. </span></p>\n<p><b>Stephen Blum (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describing himself as a “proud product of public schools,” Blum was a teacher for over 20 years before he served on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Community College District Board of Trustees and California Community College League State Board. Blum is basing his campaign on small donors and not accepting donations over $100 from any individuals or groups in what he calls a “positive only” campaign, he said on his website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Dawn Addis (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addis serves on the Morro Bay City Council and said on her website that her work as a mother, public educator and community organizer guides her actions. She is supportive of climate crisis legislation, aiming to address the climate crisis by expanding clean renewable energy sources. She also aims to increase jobs and small business growth, according to her campaign’s Facebook page. </span></p>\n<h2><b>3rd District Supervisor:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Joan Hartmann </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Democrat): As the incumbent, Hartmann has been serving as the 3rd District representative — which contains Isla Vista, parts of Goleta, the Gaviota Coast and Santa Ynez — </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since 2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and has been a strong advocate for climate change legislation. Isla Vista counts for nearly a third of the population living within the district.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, Hartmann discussed how the Santa Barbara oil spill inspired her to enter into academia, then law and then into the role of Supervisor. She placed importance on UCSB faculty housing, said she is a “huge supporter” of unionized labor and supports regulated cannabis within the county. She has also worked with several members of the Isla Vista Community Services District, supported the creation of the district and has been endorsed by several directors as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>Bruce Porter: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Porter’s second time running for the 3rd District seat. He is running on a platform of investing in alternative energy, “[restoring] balance to county government,” reinvesting in public schools and implementing a “common sense” cannabis policy, according to </span><a href=\"http://bruceporter.org/priorities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter has faced significant backlash in the past few months from Isla Vista residents and UCSB students for his alleged role in the creation of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/rock-the-vote-sb-declared-illegitimate-by-national-org-shuts-down-operations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an organization that allegedly was created to tip the scales in the supervisor race by causing low voter turnout. He did not attend the Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, bowing out of the forum four hours before it was set to begin, citing mismanagement on the part of the forum’s organizers. </span></p>\n<p><b>Karen Jones (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Jones’ second time running for the 3rd District seat, and she currently serves as a director on the Santa Ynez Community Services District. Born and raised in Santa Barbara, she is anti-“big government”, according to her website, and is in support of the Cat Canyon Oil Drilling Project, which the A.S. Senate </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/senate-passes-resolution-opposing-cat-canyon-drilling-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">voted in November 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to oppose. She also prides herself on only accepting small donations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Tuesday night’s Isla Vista town hall, she emphasized her identity as the “only native-born, only Republican” in the race. When asked about the UC COLA movements, she said that she is not a fan of organized labor and said she believes that salaries can be negotiated and worked out without a union. She added that she believes that marijuana should be legalized, but not controlled by the government. </span></p>\n<h2><b>State Senator: </b></h2>\n<p><b>Monique Lim</b><b>ó</b><b>n (Democrat):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Lim</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ón currently is in her second term as an assembly member in the California Legislature. She is the former commissioner of the Santa Barbara County Commission for Women and serves as vice chair of the California Legislative Women’s Caucus, advocating for better representation for women in government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lim</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ón has pushed for protection of the environment, authoring bills to stop offshore drilling. She has also authored bills in the past two years on health issues, ranging from extending care for those affected by the Thomas Fire to setting a ceiling for anticancer medication. Additionally, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lim</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ón has addressed emergency response programs and passed initiatives such as AB 1956, increasing support for fire prevention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through her work as the chair of the Committee on Banking and Finance, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lim</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ón has advocated for consumer protections for in the loan industry, passing AB 539. </span></p>\n<p><b>Gary Michaels (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels is the managing partner of Summa Solutions LLC, a company that brokers contracts between K-12 schools and internet carriers. Spending most of his time in the private sector, Michaels is advocating for reduced regulations and taxes to make it easier for businesses to thrive, according to his website, and supports economic policies introduced by President Donald Trump.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building upon the private sector, Michaels hopes to create more jobs in business, while making California energy efficient by incentivizing and attracting environmental technology companies to Santa Barbara. He also supports reforming health care and supports Trump’s health care plan to allow a competitive market between health care companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels also attributes poverty and homelessness issues to a lack of affordable housing and wage increases for long-term employees. He prides himself on being a fiscal conservative.</span></p>\n<p><b>Anastasia Stone (Nonpartisan): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone has not held political office before and is hoping to serve Californians without answering to parties or special interests. Having worked in maternal health care for the past 10 years, Stone is advocating for quality health care for all and intends to create legislation to protect and better women’s rights, according to her website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a former foster parent, she also seeks to improve conditions for foster children and improve workloads to be manageable for caseworkers in the foster care system. Stone said she holds an approach rooted in compassion toward homelessness.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [10:47 a.m.]: This article has been updated to reflect that Hartmann is a registered Democrat. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92910\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92910\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/","id":3698,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3697,3696,3695],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"3rd District Supervisor Candidates Field Community Questions at Isla Vista Town Hall","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2020-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DSC_7815.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DSC_7815.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Questions written by attendees prior challenged the candidates on issues including environmental policy, mental health and affordable housing in I.V. and the county as a whole.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vistans filled the I.V.

I.V. composes nearly a third of the population within the 3rd District. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 3rd District supervisor is typically a tie-breaking position on the board, with two left-leaning zones to the south and two conservative ones to the north. Hartmann is running as a nonpartisan candidate; Jones is running as a Republican. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race’s third candidate, Bruce Porter, who also ran against Hartmann in 2016, did not attend the town hall. His campaign released a statement Tuesday afternoon requesting the town hall be rescheduled due to a “lack of communication among the organizers,” which includes Associated Students Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs (A.S. EVPLA), Movement for Intersectional Collective Action (MICA), the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Center, Gauchos Vote and the Beloved Community Isla Vista</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christian Ornelas, the EVPLA, and Diana Garcia, an organizer with MICA, responded to Porter through a statement sent out later that afternoon, saying that while they would not be rescheduling the event, they were “very open to hosting another town hall event” that includes Porter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter also later said in a press release that he plans on hosting a separate town hall in I.V. next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Porter was not present at Tuesday’s town hall, his absence loomed over the event, as both Hartmann and Jones commented on his lack of presence.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Tonight, Bruce Porter was going to tell you that he cares about you,” Hartmann told the crowd at the end of her opening statement. “But he didn’t show up.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He bragged to his supporters about the 1,400 fewer students registered in I.V.

He only got 20% of the vote in I.V.; I got 80%,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Hartmann and Jones disagreed across the board on a variety of topics, at the heart of their differences are their career paths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the incumbent, Hartmann emphasized her ongoing political experience with the Board of Supervisors and the projects she has spearheaded over the past four years since her election in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones, on the other hand, positioned herself as a political outsider, emphasizing the deregulation of private businesses as one of her main platform points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Joan and I have very different approaches to things, and the people who trust me are my friends and neighbors,” Jones said, repeatedly bringing up her working-class experience and lack of a college education throughout the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Joan has spent a lifetime working in government and she’s met some really educated, neat people like herself, but they really are not the experts on innovation or the private sector.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates also addressed issues relating to climate change and renewable energy;  Hartmann extensively spoke about her pro-environmental record and her goal to transition Santa Barbara to clean, renewable energy sources.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sustainable, renewable, predictably priced energy will be very important [for the economy],” she said, adding that clean energy would work as an appeal to bring larger companies to the northern county, both creating additional jobs and helping the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann also discussed current composting groups and efforts to ban single-use plastics on campus and in I.V. as an initiative the county could also adopt to become environmentally friendly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones did not shy away from her pro-fossil fuel stance and her own family’s connection to the oil industry in the northern county, which she views as a job creator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Hartmann] talks about S.T.E.M. jobs, this is it. I mean fossil fuel production, those involve S.T.E.M. jobs, that’s not just a bunch of meatheads doing that. These are very sophisticated jobs,” Jones said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fossil fuels are solar energy; that is stored solar energy, folks. That is through photosynthesis. The breakdown of plants become oil and we harvest it now for energy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the issue of affordable housing, both candidates agreed there is a need for additional workforce housing, particularly in I.V., but differed on what the solution would look like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones proposed cutting down taxes and reducing government regulations to make room for smaller developers to build more housing in the county. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can’t always keep fitting more rats in the aquarium,” Jones said, referring to the spike in UCSB’s student population over the years without a comparable increase in housing options. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones suggested that prospective university students should consider initially forgoing higher education in order to decrease local housing prices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann noted that the price of rent in Santa Barbara has increased three times faster than the cost of living and said she was “working hard to force the university to follow through on their required mandate” from the state to build more housing for faculty and students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates also addressed the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost-of-living</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> adjustment (COLA) movements by graduate students at UCSB and in the larger UC system, which Hartmann said she supports. Jones said that she hopes the graduate students can work out a deal with the university but added that she dislikes using union tactics to do so. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two candidates also provided drastically different opinions on the topic of equity and diversity in I.V. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also believe that our institutions must do everything they can to promote diversity and inclusion,” Hartmann said. “When I was a graduate student, I was the only woman in my class and there were no women professors at my graduate school.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones responded, saying, “I don’t see color, I don’t see sexual orientation, I don’t even see sex,” and believes that no group should gain “special” rights. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she is “the only local person that is native-born, married to a guy who was born in the 3rd District.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another topic affecting both I.V. and the county as a whole is the legalization and regulation of recreational cannabis. Hartmann said she has worked to change county-wide legislation from a lottery to merit-based system when issuing cannabis dispensary licenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People [have] said to me, ‘Hell no, we don’t want [a lottery system]. You go back and change the county’s mind because we want a merit-based system.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann said that she’ll be back in I.V. in the spring to hold a community meeting for residents to discuss what they want in an ideal cannabis dispensary applicant, and from there, will use that input to assess which applicant will fit the goals and needs of I.V. residents, a process that will “differ by community” across the county.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said she favors private businesses and deregulation in the cannabis industry and said she believes regulations get in the way of small businesses, like cannabis dispensaries, from operating. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann argued that county regulation of the cannabis industry was necessary, saying that without regulation, cannabis “can be quite contaminated and create a lot of problems for people in our county.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones acknowledged in her closing statement that, as a Republican, she is unlikely to win many votes in I.V., but encouraged the crowd — some of whom occasionally heckled her during the event — to vote and advance her instead of Porter to the November ballot against Hartmann.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the previous race for the seat in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hartmann won 53.96% of the district votes, beating out Porter’s 45.79%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can get your friends and classmates to vote for me and it will not jeopardize Joan’s chances at all,” Jones said. “It will give her somebody that is a worthy opponent.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her closing statement, Hartmann reiterated her positions stated during the town hall along with some of the endorsements she received, including one from the recently withdrawn candidate, Jessica Alvarez Parfrey.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will continue to lead the just transition to a green energy economy with environmental and economic benefits, I will support a more representative and inclusive county government, I will fight for progressive causes including workers’ rights and environmental justice and I will protect your safety, our water resources, our open spaces and our climate,” Hartmann said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

At noon, graduate students will walk to the University Library for a rally before marching back to Cheadle Hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students will only end their occupation of Cheadle Hall before midnight if Chancellor Henry T.

The graduate students also have been withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades after voting in December to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC graduate students are on a wildcat strike, which means their strike is not currently authorized by their union. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After less than a week of the UCSC strike, Napolitano addressed the strike </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/janet-napolitano-ucsc-administration-warn-of-termination-to-striking-ucsc-graduate-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in an email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to UCSC students, staff and faculty on Feb. 14, warning that “participation in the wildcat strike will have consequences, up to and including the termination of existing employment at the University.” UCSC Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer also told UCSC faculty in an email that graduate students had until Feb. 21 to submit the Fall Quarter 2019 grades that they have been withholding as part of the strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students plan to occupy Cheadle Hall until midnight on Saturday as a symbolic gesture with UCSC graduate students, who have been given a midnight deadline to submit their grades. According to an informal poll sent out earlier this week at UCSC, 171 graduate students, out of the 188 who responded, said that they are still withholding grades from Fall Quarter 2019 after receiving a warning letter of dismissal from Kletzer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a Call for Solidarity </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1jY3jmu1W2dPfy9noM1FEpR_WRtheRLSlaOd_qRytYpk/mobilebasic?fbclid=IwAR3W0cnvRDDMFRrOdCWYsZH3D7hq_ylf5wVTvIx0j4FAEERgyUTZ3eOU51c\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students asked other UC campuses with COLA organizers — which now include all but San Francisco — to “walk out </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in solidarity against the retaliatory measures that are being threatened against your UCSC comrades.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA groups across the UC plan to take </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/payusmoreucsc/status/1229892589123293186/photo/1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">various actions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Friday, including marches and presentations of their demands.

Organizers are planning to take a vote next Monday to potentially go on strike at UCSB, if UCSC graduate students are dismissed from teaching positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an informal poll about the possibility of striking at UCSB with 595 responses, 63% of graduate students who responded said they were “willing to pursue” a full strike if UCSC dismisses graduate student strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin noted during the meeting that these numbers are greater than ones from initial strike polls at UCSC prior to the beginning of their strike, and that more than a quarter of the entire graduate student population had responded to the poll. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA organizers said in the meeting that they plan to send out another poll next week to graduate students to assess support of a grading strike or full teaching strike and will meet again on Monday evening for COLA General Assembly.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. Max Abrams/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her discussion, titled “From Social Movement to Social Impact: Putting an End to Sexual Harassment,” challenged the audience to expand their personal definitions of gender-based violence and emphasized the structural change required to transform the culture around sexual harassment and violence across the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara’s Feminist Futures Initiative, which brings together UC Santa Barbara faculty, students and outside speakers to collaborate on interdisciplinary research on gender justice, hosted the event alongside the UCSB Women’s Center and local businesswoman Sara Miller McCune. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in the afternoon, Hill met with over 30 high school students, undergraduates and graduate students, some of whom are engaged with researching sexual harassment on campus, according to Professor Leila Rupp, associate dean of social sciences, who introduced Hill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“None of the students this afternoon were even born when Dr. Hill gave her courageous and world-altering testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,” Rupp said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also spoke at UCSB in 1995, and at the beginning of her speech noted that, after 25 years, it is “hard to imagine we are still in the struggle together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realize that it’s been a while since 1991. Some of you are probably wondering, ‘Why didn’t you wear that green suit?’ and some of you are probably wondering, ‘Oh, when’s she gonna start dishing the dirt on the senators?’” she joked to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill did not dwell on her own experiences in the Senate Judiciary Committee and instead focused her speech on the work that still remains after the launch of the #MeToo movement, which reignited the conversation about accountability of those in powerful positions regarding sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill noted that her own experiences in the Senate parallel that of Christine Blasey Ford, who in 2017 testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was in high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to understand that what happened to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford should never happen again, but we also have to recognize that it is happening every day to somebody in this country,” Hill told the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that outrage over the Kavanaugh confirmation changed the course of the 2018 midterm election, but that the response from the federal government since then has been lacking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No robust government response to gender-based violence has occurred and in this primary cycle, little or no attention has been given to what many call a moment of reckoning that happened back in 2017,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of conversation around sexual violence, Hill said, includes current 2020 Democratic primary candidates, who participated in a debate in Nevada on the night of Hill’s speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are in another debate tonight and if the history proves to be a reflection of what’s going to happen in the future, those questions are not going to be had,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill challenged the audience to expand the way they view gender justice to include not only sexual harassment, but sexual assault, domestic violence, rape and incest. To fully understand the problem of gender-based violence, Hill said that society needs to examine the “bigger picture” of how survivors are treated beyond the specifics of their own experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can relate to the individual stories, but it is just as important for us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our solutions have to be multi-dimensional because the impacts of gender-based violence are multi-dimensional. It impacts [people’s] ability in many cases, depending on the nature of the problem, to have housing, to be educated, to live safely in their communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that the U.S. government has “taken on huge social problems,” such as the opioid crisis, by addressing the problem as a matter of public safety, and that the same approach needs to be taken to address gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill said that this can’t be left to the government to solve alone, that individuals need to also view gender-based violence as a matter of public safety and “problem solve as a community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we really believe that abuse that affects one person affects us all? Do we really believe that we are all in this? I’m not sure we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One structural change Hill proposed to address gender-based violence is to challenge how society as a whole approaches masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This idea of manliness is curated to make us believe that to be a man you must be emotionally restrained, strong and brave, aggressive and awesome,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[That] is not masculinity, it is abuse.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also elaborated on what she said is the systematic practice of silencing people who choose to come forward with stories of gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Believing women to be truthful is consistent with fairness and justice,” she said. “Now all of you believe that, right?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cheers and applause from the audience, she continued, “We are now in a time where if we say we believe survivors, we are met with the claim that we are denying due process. In other words, due process has been weaponized to silence survivors.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do not support a system that presumes every time a woman testifies about abuse, she is lying. But that is what many of us start with: that she cannot be trusted to tell the truth,” Hill emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill’s testimony against Thomas in 1991 raised complicated questions about the intersectionality of race and gender, she said. Opponents criticized Hill for coming forward, saying she “did a disservice to the Black community by testifying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those critics, Hill asked for the trust that she believes all survivors deserve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, Hill spoke with UCSB feminist studies graduate students Amoni Thompson and Megan Spencer, answering their questions about her career and life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responding to a question from Spencer about solidarity with student movements, Hill expressed her support for UC graduate students calling for a cost-of-living adjustment, a movement known as COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Affordable housing is an issue for everyone,” Hill said to audience applause. “Unfortunately, most families have to fight that issue on their own, but our students should not have to fight this battle on their own. Universities should be using their resources to help them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill left the audience with a challenge: No matter how difficult it may be to fully change the culture around gender-based violence, she said, it is just as important now as it was when she first spoke to the Senate in 1991 to fight for structural change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is natural to revert back to the status quo. It’s inevitable. But the problem is so severe, we cannot afford to do that.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-92890\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the stations is to provide hungry students with a quick snack during the middle of their days. </span><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Promise Scholar Program is comprised of 500 students who are a part of underrepresented and low-income groups and who have an average family income of $25,000, according to Program Director Holly Roose. Students who qualify for the program are promised an estimated $120,000 in financial aid over four years if they remain Cal Grant or Pell Grant eligible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose said that the goal of the stations is to provide students who are hungry with a quick snack during the middle of their days, with options such as granola bars, trail mix, fig bars and fruit snacks, and to supply menstrual products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the frustrations that motivated this project was that in order to get into the dining commons and access the [A.S.] Food Bank, you need to have a student ID, and our [Promise Scholar] kids often lose their IDs so $35 is a lot of money to replace it,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stations have been placed in 10 locations on campus, including the Transfer Student Center, Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success Student Center, UCSB Student Health, the MultiCultural Center, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, El Centro, College of Letters and Sciences Advising in Cheadle Hall, the Athletics Department, the Educational Opportunity Program and the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose explained that the new project was funded by the California government, which allocated around $80,000. The grant is designated to be spent by June and will be a contender for renewal if the project succeeds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students with a heavy academic workload, sitting down for a meal during the day is not always feasible. Fifth-year biochemistry and molecular biology major and Promise Scholar Sami Kaayal said the conveniently placed snacks have helped him stay fueled during busy days. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a decent chunk of those snacks throughout the week can help me whether I’m rushing to class and I don’t have time to eat breakfast … or just as supplemental snacks throughout the day between classes,” Kaayal said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Promise Scholars Program represents low-income students, Roose explained that the healthy snacks and menstrual products are available to all students on campus, regardless of income. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Promise Scholars Program deals with very low-income students, but the middle-class students fall through the cracks on this campus as well,” Roose said. “They don’t get financial aid but they can’t necessarily pay for college either so some of the middle-class students are even needier sometimes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, I just want hungry students to get food and proper sanitary products.”</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aniket Mehrotra</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributed reporting. </span></em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

400;\">initiative</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows students from any college or university with a summer job or internship in the Santa Barbara area to stay in UCSB-owned housing for the summer. The initiative was created in response to similar programs at other UC schools, such as UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley, according to Whitney Morris, director of Conference and Hospitality Services at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We noticed that [the program] was very successful [at other UC schools],” Morris said, “and that it was definitely fitting a need for students in the summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because subletting apartments or houses over the summer in the Santa Barbara area can be expensive for students, Morris said she and her colleagues wanted to create an affordable alternative for college students interning in the area, regardless of whether or not they are enrolled at UCSB. The San Joaquin Villages were </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/freshman-summer-start-program-fssp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previously used</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for summer camps and programs, such as for parents staying overnight for their child’s freshman orientation, and will continue to house students and parents for summer programs alongside the new intern housing.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in the summer Intern Housing program would live in the apartments for a 30-day minimum at a cost of $35 per night, or $1,050 a month, for a double room or $55 per night, or $1,650 a month, for a single room, according to the program’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, the summer Intern Housing program has one applicants and has 107 bed spaces to fill, Morris said. Participants must be at least 18 years old and provide proof of enrollment in a college or university. The program is also open to UCSB students working on campus during the summer. The application for the program opened on Feb. 3 and will close at 12 p.m. on June 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The San Joaquin Villages, </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/hdae-building-development\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">built in 2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/residences/san-joaquin-villages\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s newest housing complex</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The San Joaquin Villages were built as a part of the university’s </span><a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Range Development Plan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an initiative to increase UCSB’s enrollment by one percent each year until 2025. The plan seeks to accommodate a total of 5,000 additional students and provide housing for all of them. The San Joaquin Villages feature 165 apartments and can house approximately 1,000 residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The complex was chosen for the program because of its amenities, which include a pool and volleyball courts, and its short distance to the dining options available in Isla Vista and Goleta, Morris said. She added that the apartment style of the housing would also be “great in terms of promoting communities.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction [2/20/2020, 7:45 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the San Joaquin Villages were previously used to house parents and their children for summer programs.

bunch up near the door, craning to catch a glimpse at the men responsible for filling the Friday night air with music. A group of professors sat together toward the front of the room, while other adults from the local Santa Barbara community sat at tables enjoying food. Students crowded the back, mostly standing and swaying to the beat, and Chancellor Henry T. Yang and his wife were seated at a far table with their eyes fixed on the band at the front, the music uniting different and usually separate groups of people that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the scene of the first performance of the new year for Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse, a pop-up club featuring a series of local musicians who aim to bring the Isla Vista community together and provide a space for music and conversation on important topics. The event series was founded in 2015 by Jeffrey Stewart, a professor in UC Santa Barbara’s Department of Black Studies​ and a recent Pulitzer Prize winner for the biography “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the project was formed as a response to the distress felt after the Isla Vista tragedy, Stewart said. Wanting to bring the people of I.V. back together again, Stewart could think of no better way than through music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea was initially sparked by a student’s comment that made note of the similarities between the small, congested and tense venues in Paris and those in I.V. Inspired by the intimacy of the jazz clubs, Stewart said he saw the value in replicating them for the community surrounding UCSB and I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was in Pasadena, we used to have coffeehouses and people would play jazz, so I just tried to reproduce it,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each venue for Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse is carefully selected and transformed into a warm yet still stylish space, Stewart said. The series also works in conjunction with Stewart’s class, History of Jazz, and runs alongside it during winter quarter. After trying to bring musicians into class to perform for students, Stewart said he quickly realized that it wasn’t the right environment for students, or anyone for that matter, to be able to enjoy or appreciate jazz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need learning environments in the community that aren’t as heavy handed as a real classroom,” Stewart noted. Now, with the creation of Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse, his students are always in attendance and able to experience jazz in its natural setting, rather than in a classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The theory of the class is that jazz evolves through dialogue between the performers and the audience,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart said he hopes that students will discover new tastes and different preferences through  the music they experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s his goal “that the students have a feeling that they’re part of this, [that] they’re not just spectators or listeners.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its creation, Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse has been unique in its ability to attract a wide variety of different people to its events, Stewart said. He noted that “a lot of students live here, but they have really no interaction with the people in the community,” which he aims to change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events such as Stewart’s are one of a few that make an attempt to bridge the gap between different generations in the community, he said. While it’s often rare to see professors, students and locals of I.V. together in the same space, these events encourage exactly that, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only here can a professor show their students how to properly bust a move on the dance floor, while Chancellor Yang catches it all on video. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s not really a space on campus even for professors to hang out,” Stewart added. While the University Center is often the go-to meeting spot, he said “it doesn’t seem warm; it often feels cold and commercial.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These events also provide a much-needed outlet and space for dialogue among I.V. residents, Stewart said. Often featuring spoken word and panels on relevant issues like intersectional justice, gender, violence and food insecurity, these pop-up clubs make an effort to accompany music with meaningful conversation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart emphasized the need for these types of spaces, remarking that “there are very few places where students can come and have discussions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse is proof, Stewart said, that “you can have learning going on in spaces that are also pleasurable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to have this cited in Isla Vista, in the hopes that more people will come from downtown and be able to view this community not just as some crazy college town,” Stewart said — a testament to the power music has to bring a community together.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/me.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Emily Kocis</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Emily Kocis is the 2020-2021 Assistant Opinion Editor.
