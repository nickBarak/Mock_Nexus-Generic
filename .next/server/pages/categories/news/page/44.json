Students live in I.V. for four to five years; they deserve to have their voices heard,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>The resolution writes that non-citizen resident status includes “visa holders, permanent residents, undocumented, and mixed status.”</p>\n<p>The Senate will only support these efforts if residents’ personal information and voting data will not be accessible to third parties such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (I.C.E.), and if any movements to extend voting rights to non-citizens does not negatively impact UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Residents of I.V. pay property taxes which fund local agencies including the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and local school districts, but only citizens can elect board members to these organizations.</p>\n<p>The issue of voting rights for non-citizens is personal for Cornejo.</p>\n<p>“As students and residents here we pay taxes … For some, you do have a vote on who you elect, for others, myself for instance, I do not,” Cornejo told the Senate during Wednesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Measure R was cited as a reason for passing the resolution. Because non-citizens could not vote for this measure, which raised taxes for I.V. residents, “many students and UCSB community members [are] disenfranchised regarding their tax dollars,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>During discussion of the resolution, Cornejo cited the San Francisco Unified School District as an example of granting non-citizens the right to vote in District elections. In November 2016, San Francisco voters passed Proposition N, which extended voting rights in school district elections to non-citizens who are of legal voting age and are a parent or legal guardian of a child under 19 living in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are no resolutions to extend voting rights to non-citizens in I.V., and the path to extend non-citizens the right to vote is more complex than other cities because I.V. is unincorporated territory.</p>\n<p>According to Cornejo, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors would have to vote to declare I.V. incorporated territory. If I.V. was an incorporated territory, town representatives could add a resolution into I.V.’s bylaws granting non-citizens voting rights in local elections.</p>\n<p>As of 7 p.m. on Wednesday, I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said he was not aware of the resolution and said he would have to consult I.V. CSD’s legal counsel before he could give a firm answer about what governing body would have the power to grant non-citizens local voting rights.</p>\n<p>“But in general, I support allowing undocumented people to vote in local elections. If you live here and pay taxes here, you should be able to participate in local decision making,” Brandt added in a statement to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Katherine Swartz is a staff writer at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The center would provide legal assistance for survivors of sexual assault and would receive support from A.S. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Services District finalized an agreement during its Jan. 8 meeting to open a survivor resource center in Isla Vista in collaboration with Standing Together Against Sexual Assault, a organization addressing sexual assault in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) President Emily Montalvo-Telford said the new center would make it easier for survivors to meet with a Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) representative and receive immediate counseling. The center will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>\n<p>The center will provide a place in I.V. where survivors can receive medical attention, make a police report and obtain an emergency protective order. Previously, survivors would only have access to these services at STESA’s location in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Survivors will also be able to obtain emergency services such as food, shelter and transportation. The center will also have the resources to help survivors apply for U Visas and T Visas, Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>U visas are non-immigrant visas designed to aid victims of crime who have suffered physical or mental abuse in the U.S. and are assisting the investigation of the crime. T visas provide the same service to those who have suffered from human trafficking.</p>\n<p>The idea for a Survivor Resource Center in I.V. began with <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">Ro’Shawndra Earvin’s 2017 Demands</a>, a list of 12 demands presented to Chancellor Yang after a 13 hour sit-in.</p>\n<p>Earvin, a former student at UCSB and advocate for sexual assault reforms, along with a large group of students, presented a list of 12 demands calling for sexual assault reform. The No. 1 demand on the list called for the creation of a survivor resource center.</p>\n<p>STESA, along with SASA and the I.V. CSD board members, have been collaborating over the past year in order to make the center a reality.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V. CSD, said work on the project first began in Spring 2018 when he was approached by Montalvo and Madeline Loudon, I.V. Community Coordinator for SASA. They presented to Brandt the lack of services for survivors of sexual assault provided by UCSB and said that the resource center would be a quick solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>“We want to be a voice for survivors when there are injustices in the system,” Brandt said. “So this, in particular, is an example of a supporting service.”</p>\n<p>Funding for the center primarily comes from the Measure R tax that was passed last year, granting the CSD a source of revenue for their projects.</p>\n<p>The survivor resource center will be located in a central location in I.V. and will be easily accessible for residents of the community, Montalvo said. To access the center, a survivor would need to call STESA’s hotline at (805) 564-3696, where they will be directed by an advocate to the center for aid.</p>\n<p>“During our budgeting process this year, it was a big priority for the budget committee to make a line item specifically for renovating this space so that it could become the survivor resource center,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Montalvo and Brandt both mentioned how rewarding it was to work with the various groups dedicated to resolving the issue of sexual assault in I.V. and UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, this project was one of the smoothest that I’ve ever seen, especially when it comes to projects where I’ve worked with student groups on it, and that is really a testament to SASA and everything they’ve done. The same would go for STESA,” said Brandt.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Arturo Martinez is a reporter at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Jan. 7, 2019, called his $144 billion budget a “California For All” plan that places emphasis on “building a foundation for the American dream.”</p>\n<p>“During my inaugural speech, I described the California Dream as a house we are building together,” Newsom said in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/01/10/governor-newsom-proposes-2019-20-california-for-all-state-budget/\">press release</a>. “That wasn’t just a speech device – it’s exactly what we are proposing today. To make the California Dream available to all, our state must be fiscally sound.”</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Board of Regents were quick to praise Newsom’s budget, calling it a “welcome step and a solid down payment” for the UC system.</p>\n<p>“These funds help further the academic mission of the university, from student success to classroom upgrades, financial aid to timely graduations,” UCOP and the Regents said in joint statement released soon after the budget plan was announced.</p>\n<p>Gov. Newsom’s funds for the UC are mainly split into three parts: $240 million toward an ongoing general fund, $138 million as one-time payment and $15 million to increase degree completion and programs at UC extension centers, according to the budget.</p>\n<p>The ongoing general fund will fund finance operating costs, efforts to increase student success, improving student mental health services and helping to address homelessness and student hunger; the one-time fund will address the UC’s deferred maintenance backlog.</p>\n<p>“These investments are provided with the expectation that tuition will remain flat, access will be increased, and time to degree will improve,” the budget states.</p>\n<p>This $400 million is <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/brown-signs-budget-act-of-2018-increases-funding-to-uc/\">an increase</a> from the $346 million that former Gov. Brown allocated in the Budget Act of 2018.</p>\n<p>Newsom’s budget took into account the UC’s “significant growth” over the past decade. Enrollment for the UC system rose from about 230,000 students in 2010 compared to 270,000 for fall 2017, a 19.2 percent increase, according to the budget.</p>\n<p>For UC Santa Barbara, this was 22,000 in 2010 to approximately 25,000 students for Fall 2017.</p>\n<p>Within the $400 million allotted, there is also a designated $5.3 million toward mental health services – with the goal of allowing campuses to hire additional clinicians –– and $15 million toward addressing student hunger and housing needs.</p>\n<p>Approximately $1.3 million for an immigration legal services program is also designated, to begin in 2022-23.</p>\n<p>The budget also included a $1 million fund toward supporting UC Davis’ Firearms Violence Research Center, beginning in 2021-22.</p>\n<p>Newsom will not sign the budget until June, after the California legislature has voted on it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Jan. 7, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence and Sofia Mejias-Pascoe can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

To some extent, their calls seem to have been heard.</p>\n<p>Hannah-Beth Jackson, Santa Barbara’s state senator representing California’s 19th district and author of SB 1346, optimistically expressed approval for the new gun control laws.</p>\n<p>Although these laws encompass the entire state, UCSB’s past experience with gun violence oftentimes compels many local leaders and students to be more vocal about their opinions on the issue of gun control.</p>\n<p>In May 2014, a violent attack in I.V. left six people dead. Half died due to gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p>“[UCSB] students will support these laws by being reminded that we need to do more — this will give them an incentive to call for more action, particularly at the federal level to combat gun violence,” Jackson said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>Combating gun violence has been an ongoing initiative in California, highlighted by legislative action taken by former California Governor Jerry Brown.</p>\n<p>While Gov. Brown did sign some bills addressing gun control, he also vetoed a number of them, some of which could have reduced the number of guns in the state, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>In the context of gun control, Jackson has high expectations for Gov. Newsom.</p>\n<p>“I expect him to be very supportive of policies that help reduce gun violence and keep our communities safe,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jackson believes her bump-stock bill, SB 1346, will have an impact in reducing gun violence by prohibiting access to bump stocks in California and will hopefully reduce the number of gun deaths in the state.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy to see that our representative Hannah Beth Jackson introduced SB 1346,” Jeike Meijer, Associated Students (A.S.) executive vice president of local affairs, said in an email.</p>\n<p>Meijer spoke at the vigil for the 11 lives lost in a Pittsburgh synagogue due to gun violence and then again at the vigil in remembrance of the Thousand Oaks shooting victims.</p>\n<p>Both mass shootings occurred in November.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’ll see the rest of the country follow California soon,” Meijer added.</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel, A.S. president, believes the new legislation will be effective.</p>\n<p>“[Gun violence] is always on people’s minds, on prospective students’ minds, and I think that these kinds of measures are exactly what we need to have students feel more comfortable and safe in Isla Vista,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>Kopel believes that SB 1100 specifically, which raises the minimum age to 21 to purchase a firearm, would make UCSB students more comfortable “knowing that the people around them can’t even purchase a firearm.”</p>\n<p>“Even though most of the students that are attending this university now weren’t here to experience the 2014 shooting, that legacy does live on through vigils and remembrances,” Kopel added.</p>\n<p>Still, Kopel finds that more work needs to be done and believes that a “cultural change” regarding guns is needed in the United States.</p>\n<div

done.</p>\n<p>Limón is specifically looking forward to the potential impacts of AB 3129, which imposes a lifetime ban on individuals convicted of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>“I am especially hopeful that AB 3129… will make an impact in reducing the rate of women and children who die at the hands of repeat domestic abusers,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, believes that California serves as a model for the rest of the country when it comes to gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“As a resident of Isla Vista, I feel like my voice has been heard and that our calls for reducing the amount of gun violence in this country are actually being taken seriously,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>While Brandt believes that California is an effective leader on gun control legislation, he does not think the federal government has been adequately following California’s lead.</p>\n<p>“The national government, under the Republican Party, has decided that they’re going to pretend like they can ignore this issue and it’ll just go away,” Brandt said. “I think that that philosophy is something that has never worked out well and never been viewed well by history.”</p>\n<p>“The federal government used to look to California as a model, because these are the sorts of bills that should be implemented nationally.”</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal said that he’s fighting for just that: he wants pieces of California gun control legislation to be laws of the nation.</p>\n<p>Carbajal plans to reintroduce the Gun Violence Restraining Act in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>“[The Gun Violence Restraining Act] allows family members, when they come across a loved one that seems to be, through their behavior, posing a danger to themselves or others… to work with law enforcement, officials and the court system to temporarily take guns away from [that individual],” Carbajal said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually similar to the one that California has in place that was enacted after the tragedy that happened in Isla Vista and UCSB, so it’s duplicating a similar law that exists in California.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal believes that the new California gun control legislation will enhance gun safety in California, and says he is “working to introduce similar legislation and be

student performance of “HAIR the Musical” this weekend. Shrunken Heads Production Company, a student-run theatre group that organizes various musical performances, will be offering several showtimes throughout the weekend, with performances at Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at Campbell Hall. Sing along to hit rock songs from the musical including  “Aquarius,” “Good Morning Starshine” and “Let the Sunshine In” while following the story of a group of young friends who navigate the trials of everyday life against the backdrop of the military draft and Vietnam War. UCSB Students and military members can get in for free; students can buy tickets for $5.50 and general admission is $10.50.</p>\n<p><strong>Venom</strong></p>\n<p>If you missed it in the theatres, the film “Venom” is coming to Isla Vista Theatre this Tuesday, Jan. 22. UCSB students can enjoy showings either at 7 p.m. or 10 p.m. by showing their ACCESS card at the door. The movie presents an alternative storyline related to the original “Spiderman” in which a journalist by the name of Eddie Brock contracts a mutant organism while investigating the nefarious experiments of scientist Carlton Drake. Brock struggles throughout the movie to control the raging power and superhuman abilities he possesses while trying to prevent Venom from overpowering him. Be sure to bring snacks along with your friends to enjoy the movie in comfort.</p>\n<p><strong>Pajama Party!</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t let the rain keep you indoors this weekend! A couple local bands will brave the storm to perform live music for I.V. residents. Stop by to see Close Out, a three-member punk, reggae, alternative rock band from I.V. and Peach Gazebo, another local band this Friday at 6666 Sueno Rd. Party-goers are encouraged to come dressed in their comfiest onesie or pajamas to dance the night away in style. Peach Gazebo opens the show from 9:20 p.m to 10:20 p.m. and then Close Out will finish out the night from 9:30 p.m. to 12 a.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Shopping in Style </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re one of those people who still don’t use reusable bags when grocery shopping, you’re still in 2018. Update your shopping routine while learning about the latest in zero-waste grocery shopping from staff at the I.V. Food Co-op on 6575 Seville Rd. This upcoming Wednesday, Jan. 23, from 4 to 5:30 p.m., Co-Op Sustainability Coordinator Allison will provide information on how attendees can reduce their “shopping footprint.” The workshop includes tastings of zero-waste recipes as well as raffles to win reusable water bottles and containers. All participants will leave with a reusable shopping bag, so for that roommate who always asks to borrow yours, be sure to bring them along.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) election. Neither have previous experience in Associated Students (A.S.) Senate and did not run during either the Spring Quarter 2018 election and the Fall Quarter 2018 special election.</p>\n<p>Zierer is a fourth-year political science and English double major; Ng is a fourth-year biological sciences and global studies double major.</p>\n<p>Neither could immediately be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>A notable absence in the Winter Quarter 2019 special election is third-year history of public policy major Madeline Loudon. Loudon <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/madeline-loudon-is-sole-declared-candidate-for-evpsa-special-election/\">ran for the position</a> during both the Spring Quarter 2018 election and the Fall Quarter 2018 special election.</p>\n<p>In the first, she lost to her competitor, Mayela Morales; in the second she was the sole candidate, but the election did not reach the 16 percent voting threshold required for it to be valid.</p>\n<p>Loudon could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>This is Election Board’s second attempt to fill the position following the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Morales during the Spring Quarter 2018 election.</p>\n<p>The board discovered that Morales, a fifth-year global studies and Chicana and Chicano studies major, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">was not enrolled</a> during Spring Quarter 2018, disqualifying her from the position.</p>\n<p>Following the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-04/breaking-evpsa-seat-to-be-left-vacant-for-rest-of-academic-year/\">failure</a> to meet the minimum voting threshold for the fall election, the board petitioned to hold a Winter Quarter special election. The Senate initially tabled the petition over winter break but eventually passed it the week before school resumed.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate voted to table the ballot Wednesday night, pending further background checks of the candidates.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Lea Toubian expressed concern about voter burnout during Wednesday night’s meeting – because the board has held an election every quarter this school year unlike the typical one-election-a-year system – but Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria said he did not think it would be a problem for the upcoming spring elections.</p>\n<p>Voting for the election opens on Jan. 24, 2019. Results will be announced on Feb. 7. More than eight percent of the student body must vote in the election for it to be valid.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 17, 12:17 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

CSD, pictured above, released a statement on Monday condemning the proposed Title IX changes. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The amendments, proposed by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, would narrow the definition of sexual harassment as well as limit the proceedings to live hearings, among other changes.</p>\n<p>The amendments would also allow educational institutions to dismiss cases of sexual and domestic violence that do not occur on campus premises, according to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/httpspence/status/1084870878024818689\">statement</a> issued by Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) President Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD is “greatly concerned” about this proposed change due to the large number of students that live off-campus — I.V. alone is home to approximately 14,000 UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students, according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The statement also referenced statistics from the 2017-2018 school year, which stated that 376 students approached UCSB’s Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E) office to disclose that they had experienced “sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, and/or had been stalked, either on or off campus, recently or in the past.”</p>\n<p>“The new standard will leave the door open for legal challenges that could encourage higher education institutions to look the other way when sexual and interpersonal violence occurs off campus,” the letter said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD also said fear and pressure can leave many students unwilling to file a report.</p>\n<p>“Reporting to Title IX will become much more difficult, and some cases [may] be ignored completely,” I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said in a statement to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>With these new amendments, the I.V. CSD said it believes that even more cases could be left unreported, and students committing sexual and domestic assault could do so without facing disciplinary action from school administration.</p>\n<p>Brandt went on to highlight the ways that support groups on campus have worked to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing survivors of harassment and assault.</p>\n<p>“Survivor advocacy and support groups and political organizers, such as Students Against Sexual Assault, are doing excellent work bringing the lived experiences of survivors out of the shadows and into the light. Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration should be working with groups like them to reform Title IX policies, instead of right-wing special interest groups,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The University of California reflected <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-03/uc-responds-to-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\">similar sentiments</a> regarding the proposed amendments, according to a press release sent out by Suzanne Taylor, the UC’s interim systemwide Title IX coordinator.</p>\n<p>Taylor expressed concern that changes to Title IX would create “new and unnecessary hurdles” for survivors and hinder the university administration’s ability to properly enforce Title IX.</p>\n<p>Title IX is a federal civil rights law enacted in 1972 that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally-funded educational institutions. These regulations require administrators to take action in response to reported cases of sexual and domestic violence.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education encourages students, educators and community members to share their responses to the proposed amendments by Jan. 28.</p>\n<p><em>Amira Garewal and Sean Crommelin are reporters for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Wohlenhaus refused to identify himself so officers could give him a citation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He then became “agitated,” according to a <a href=\"https://local.nixle.com/alert/7041796/\">press release</a> sent out by SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the release, Wohlenhaus refused to cooperate with officers and attempted to walk away. When deputies attempted to restrain him, he became combative and tackled one of the deputies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the ensuing struggle, Wohlenhaus bit one deputy on the shoulder, and kicked another in the face, Hoover said. He also “forcefully” attempted to remove a deputies gun from their holster. At this point, he was tasered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While being arrested, Wohlenhaus claimed to spectators that deputies had been the ones to tackle him and admitted to the biting and reaching for the gun, according a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reporter who was at the scene.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deputies did not require medical attention. Wohlenhaus was uninjured and declined medical attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of his arrest, Wohlenhaus called out to spectators that he had been making clothing when the police approached him, suggesting that his designs were the cause of his arrest, according to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reporter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you start making really epic clothing, these guys may be actors, for all you know,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mental health request has been made, Hoover said in the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wohlenhaus has been booked in the Santa Barbara County Jail and is being held on a $1 million bail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The video of part of the incident can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/video-1547246313.mp4\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><em>Tamari Dzotsenidze is the managing editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at managing@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

written by Off-Campus Senators Christian Ornelas and Rafael Cornejo.</p>\n<p>The purpose of these Facebook accounts is to help increase senators’ accountability and transparency, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Previously, students had a difficult time finding relevant information regarding Senate, the resolution added.</p>\n<p>“When we give updates, a lot of them will be on our personal social media accounts, which [may] not always be public or as accessible as we would like it to be,” Ornelas said during Wednesday night’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Senators are required to “continuously update these pages with their current office hours, project updates, and any other relevant information.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Ornelas said an added benefit of Facebook is that it allows users to visit a page without needing to have an account for themselves.</p>\n<p>“As long as they’re able to see that content then that’s super beneficial,” he said.</p>\n<p>There will also be a university announcement sent out to the student body to make them aware of the newly created Facebook accounts.</p>\n<p>These accounts must be created by the end of Week 2 of Winter Quarter 2019 and will be

CSD and the university have made small steps toward regulating the electric scooters that often end up scattered on sidewalks, in the ocean or on bike paths.</p>\n<p>At the I.V. CSD’s Tuesday meeting, the board discussed further problems with the scooters, as well as the county’s proposed regulation of them.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County first put limited regulations on the scooters back in November, requiring electric scooter companies to obtain encroachment permits to operate within the county’s boundaries among other stipulations.</p>\n<p>The companies are also required to monitor their fleets, retrieve the scooters “as needed” and manage the number of scooters out, according to a press release sent out by the county in early November. The changes went into effect early December.</p>\n<p>In I.V., the county has also approached the idea of parking zones for the scooters, I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>The county will also implement an annual permit fee, a monthly per-vehicle fee and an impound fee for the companies to pay.</p>\n<p>“The county is going to be a lot more active and they’re kind of tying it to the outdoor space,” Abboud said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>He noted that the county is taking some of the I.V. CSD’s suggestions into account.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the county has now capped the number of scooters per company in I.V. at 200, according to I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>Brandt said that the CSD has also met with Santa Barbara County Supervisor Joan Hartmann to discuss different ways of transportation in I.V.</p>\n<p>UCPD faces its own share of problems when it comes to the scooters.</p>\n<p>Despite the app’s warning that the scooters are not allowed on campus, a threat of a $200 ticket and UCSB’s strict interim policy banning all of the scooters from campus, the department continues to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/ucpd-ups-enforcement-of-electric-scooter-violations/\">impound</a> hundreds of scooters, according to Bowman.</p>\n<p>Lime recently picked up 147 of their scooters from UCPD, but there are still currently 253 Bird scooters in impound. UCPD charges the company $24 a scooter to retrieve them.</p>\n<p>Lime has done a better job than Bird of retrieving scooters and communicating with the university, according to Bowman.</p>\n<p>A Lime representative has been in touch with Bowman to set up an event in Isla Vista to teach residents how to safely use the scooters, and has even offered to move Bird scooters off campus, Bowman said.</p>\n<p>UCPD is currently discussing what to do with the scooters that are not picked up by the companies within the allotted time frame. For example, the department has discussed the idea of dismantling the scooters and recycling the batteries, Bowman said.</p>\n<p>UCSB also created a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/birds-wings-clipped-electric-scooter-ban-in-place-on-campus/\"> policy committee</a> in October to discuss how to address scooters on campus. The committee then floated the idea of geofencing the scooters to help with regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the committee has not yet created a new policy regarding the scooters, according to Jennifer Lofthus, UCSB policy coordinator, ADA compliance and privacy officer.</p>\n<p>“We also continue to keep an eye on statewide concerns and methods of addressing the impacts of the scooters on communities such as ours,” Lofthus said in an email.</p>\n<p>“The committee will convene again at some point in Winter Quarter to discuss but that meeting has not yet been scheduled.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 10 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at evelyn@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
