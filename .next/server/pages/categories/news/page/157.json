Tasked with deposing the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and protecting the United States and her allies from the threat of weapons of mass destruction, the invasion force swiftly routed the Iraqi army.</p>\n<p>Seventy-six hundred miles away, back on our sunny campus, the war was the talk of the town. At least 1,000 UCSB students and staff members participated in a worldwide walkout, marching out of class and into Storke Plaza on March 5, 2003. In the coming weeks, rallies would continue on and off campus, and the pages of this paper’s opinion section would be stuffed with columns and letters about the prudence of preemption.</p>\n<p>However, five years later, some, like former marine-turned-political-activist Dave Hassan, have come to believe that the U.S. has separated itself from the situation in Iraq.</p>\n<p>“It’s really easy to just not be connected and just kind of being like, you know, ‘that sucks'” Hassan said. “The big difference between five years is, I guess, I’m connected.”</p>\n<p>Hassan – who has become vocal in the local peace movement since finishing his time in the Marine Corps as an Arabic translator – said that while he understands how Americans can push the war to the back of their minds, he said that “war is too fucking terrible for [him] to sit by.”</p>\n<p>“I think what really changed it for me was gaining a real sort of conception of what [doing my job as a Marine] really meant,” Hassan said. “When I saw people actually die, it really changed it for me. It shook me up. … I never actually shot anyone, but I have been responsible for people dying in the course of my job, and being responsible for that … actually changed my whole opinion. Gaining an actual connection to the Iraqi people. That’s what changed.”</p>\n<p>Gauchos in the Gulf</p>\n<p>Since 2003, UCSB’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps has sent between 40 and 50 graduates to the Middle East. And in those five years since the Iraq War began, Major Mike Salvo of UCSB’s Surfrider Battalion is proud to say that none of his cadets were wounded or killed.</p>\n<p>The ROTC program trains students throughout their time at the university and commissions cadets as 2nd lieutenants upon graduation. UCSB’s Surfrider Battalion Business Manager and Military Historian Patrick Coffield said last year was a great year for the program. The program commissioned 14 cadets as officers in the United States Army.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of UCSB ROTC graduates will see combat in the Middle East, Coffield said. He and Major Salvo estimated that 70 to 90 percent of graduates from the program find their way into combat situations.</p>\n<p>When asked about last year’s graduating class and why the service had received such a surge in enlistees, Coffield told this reporter to “Do the math.”</p>\n<p>Five years ago  – when the recent graduates were college freshmen – the memory of 9/11 was much more poignant, Major Salvo said, and the United States had just entered a war against one of the most maligned nations in the world.</p>\n<p>“People wanted to serve our country,” Coffield said.</p>\n<p>Brett Jordan, a 24-year-old native of Redondo Beach and 2006 UCSB grad, was part of that influx of students looking to serve their country. After four years of ROTC on campus, Jordan was trained for an additional six months and is now on his eighth month of service in the Anbar Province of Iraq.</p>\n<p> “My class was the first class to join post-9/11,” Jordan said. “We started school in 2002, so all of our class was the one that went in knowing ‘hey, we will definitely be going over there at some point.’ … A little daunting, but still good.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ROTC enrollment numbers are tapering down, however, and Coffield said he expects nine cadets to graduate this summer and another five the year after. Nationally, U.S. military recruitment is also declining, according to Department of Defense undersecretary David S. C. Chu.</p>\n<p>The seeming permanence of the war in Iraq, a negative view of military life and even the rising obesity rates – the military rejects a third of its applicants because of its physical fitness standards – were all cited as likely explanations for the decline.</p>\n<p>From Anbar, Two Different Views of the World</p>\n<p>Hassan and Lt. Jordan both served in the Anbar Province of Iraq. Jordan is currently stationed at al-Asad Air Base- the largest base in al-Anbar – and leads a truck company that drives freight liners packed with supplies throughout Iraq. Hassan was stationed at al-Asad a little more than two years ago, but spent most of his time in local towns.</p>\n<p>In Anbar, those two years made all the difference.</p>\n<p>Before September 2006, the region was famed for its violence, lawlessness and the harrowing battle of Fallujah. Since then, according to the New York Times, local Sunni tribes have come together to work with the U.S. military to oppose militant al-Qaeda operatives. The province is now one of the most stable in Iraq. Jordan agrees with the Times’ assessment and called it “one of the safest areas right now.”</p>\n<p>Hassan, who was stationed at al-Asad Air Base but spent most of his time in the cities of Al-Rutbah and Hit, described a different Anbar Province.</p>\n<p>“While I was there, there were a lot of attacks and we were in the process of leveling the place,” Hassan said. “We were bombing the shit out of the place.”</p>\n<p>Whether there is any correlation, both have come out of Iraq with very different feelings about America’s presence in the Middle Eastern nation.</p>\n<p>“We went in there and removed a government that wasn’t doing some things and the country needed help,” Jordan said. “When people say ‘no war, no war’, you know, war’s not fun. It never has been. But its necessary to do at times.”</p>\n<p>Hassan, on the other hand, said that he does not believe America’s presence in Iraq has or will help the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>“What exactly is the end state we’re going for [in Iraq]?” Hassan said. “We empower death squads and war lords. … In what possible state of scenarios does that lead to democracy in Iraq?”</p>\n<p>Buried in Sand</p>\n<p>Generally, in Santa Barbara, the debate is similar. But the question of whether or not American boots on the ground in Iraq can salvage the country, naturally, has no exact answer.</p>\n<p>“There’s tears in a lot of people,” Michael “the Chaplain” Cervantes said yesterday at Arlington West. “They just don’t want to talk.”</p>\n<p>Cervantes – who is not a priest, but was dubbed “the Chaplain” by his fellow volunteer veterans because of his open ears – said mournful visitors from around the world tend to hold their hearts as they stand and look over the 3,000 small, white crosses planted onto the beach next to Stearns Wharf in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Michael Moore, a serviceman stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, said he believes the U.S. is “doing the right thing.” Holding his infant son yesterday while gazing upon the sea of crosses next to Stearns Wharf, Moore said he was touched by the memorial.</p>\n<p>“It brings tears to my eyes,” he said.</p>\n<p>Volunteers from the local chapter of Veterans for Peace set up the 3,000 crosses almost every Sunday morning to represent the lives lost in Iraq. Stephen Sherrill, the mastermind behind the project and the craftsman behind each cross, said when he started, the memorial had only 287 crosses.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/","id":3568,"author":{"id":345,"name":"David Ferry"},"related":[3567,3566,3565],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Steak, Guacamole and a Deadly Weapon, Please Saturday, Feb. 23, 4:33 a.m. — Officers stationed at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office received an early-morning call concerning a man “passed ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Steak, Guacamole and a Deadly Weapon, Please<br>\nSaturday, Feb. 23, 4:33 a.m. — Officers stationed at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office received an early-morning call concerning a man “passed out drunk” in front of Freebirds.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived minutes later, the 19-year-old man was laying on the sidewalk in front of the door, vomiting.</p>\n<p>Apparently unable to keep down his drunchies, the man was also unable to tell his story.</p>\n<p>According to a witness, the man laying in a pool of his previous meal — queso-nacho-rito, anyone? — had walked into the popular burrito joint earlier carrying an open pocket knife.</p>\n<p>The man with the munchies did not threaten anyone with the knife — perhaps plastic knives just weren’t good enough for him — but, nonetheless, the witness had quickly taken the knife from the drunk.</p>\n<p>The deputies, determining that the man was too drunk even for Freebirds, called the paramedics, who transported the man to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Cross-fading the Night Away<br>\nSaturday, Feb. 23, 1:40 a.m. — Deputies patrolling the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road noticed a man having some difficulty putting one foot in front of the other sauntering down the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Officers continued to watch the man as he staggered from side to side. Judging from his apparent lack of balance, the deputies suspected the man was under the influence of a solid amount of alcohol. The fact that he was yelling at innocent passersby also helped the officers in the deduction.</p>\n<p>However, the 18-year-old man was not satisfied with his simple inebriation. Seemingly unaware of the deputies standing just paces away, the man asked aloud, “Do you know where I could score some weed?”</p>\n<p>Before he could ever get his answer, the pot-seeking soon-to-be-prisoner crossed paths with the police.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this drunken reveler did not spend the night blissfully forgetting where he put his belongings — deputies working the night shift at the Santa Barbara County Jail took care of that for him.</p>\n<p>My Name Is…<br>\nSunday, Feb. 24, 12:18 a.m. — Two males leaning against each other for support caught the attention of deputies patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>Officers spotted the 23-year-old man leaning head first against the outstretched arm of his comrade. The two, like drunken statues backlit by I.V.’s relentless debauchery, held this graceful posture for some time.</p>\n<p>But beauty is not meant to last and the two broke away and headed directly toward the officers, at which point the true extent of their intoxication came into clear focus.</p>\n<p>The deputies determined that the 23-year-old male was unable to care for himself and asked the man his name. He answered with his first name, but gave no hint of his surname.</p>\n<p>The deputies asked again several times, but the man simply smiled and shook his head, offering no answers. The officers asked him his date of birth and if he knew where he was, but with smiles abounding, he gave no answer.</p>\n<p>The deputies then asked if the man had his driver license, at which point he reached into his back pocket and produced his wallet.</p>\n<p>Yet, with his wallet out, the happy drunk was unable to find his license, even though it was clearly visible. The officer generously pointed it out to him, yet he was still unable to retrieve it.</p>\n<p>A smile goes a long way, however, and the deputies were kind enough to help the man out and retrieved his license for him.</p>\n<p>With the government-issued cheat sheet in hand, the severely confused man was still unable to provide officers with neither his last name nor his date of birth.</p>\n<p>The man was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending remembrance of his name.<br>\n— Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15994\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15994\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/","id":3875,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3874,3873,3872],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Astronomers Strive For Global Network of Telescopes","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Santa Barbara's Las Cumbres Observatory is as immaculately clean as an operating room.

Instead, they look like large black boxes stacked on top of one another. It is hard to believe they cost $150,000.</p>\n<p>The next stop on the tour requires safety goggles. The machining room, which contains all the tools necessary to build a complete telescope, includes several pieces of equipment worth over $1 million. One of these machines is the vertical boring machine – a device used to shape cylindrical objects.</p>\n<p>The last stop of the tour leads outside the observatory to a shed in the parking lot. Inside the shed is Rosing’s prototype for one of his smallest telescopes: an approximately six-foot-tall cylindrical frame of metal. Connected to the structure is a computer, meant to document the telescope’s observations. The center of the metal frame holds a large, round, 40-centimeter in diameter mirror. This is definitely not a telescope meant for backyard observations. At the Las Cumbres Observatory, located at 6740 Cortona Dr., Rosing and his organization hope to build one of the world’s first intricate networks of telescopes across the globe.</p>\n<p>Do You See What I See?: A Global Network</p>\n<p>LCOGT is a privately funded, nonprofit scientific facility that plans to center its network of telescopes in Goleta. The organization will have all the telescopes connected via the Internet and will instantly pass on observations from one site to the next. LCOGT will deploy approximately 60 telescopes in at least six sites in different longitudes across the globe in both hemispheres, including Chile, South Africa, Australia, Hawaii and the Canary Islands.</p>\n<p>Lars Bildsten, a UCSB physics professor and theoretical astrophysicist, said the goal of LCOGT’s telescope project is to always have complete coverage of the sky. The project would also allow Bildsten to further his studies of the supernova – a large luminous explosion with the potential to radiate as much energy as the sun would emit over 10 billion years. Since supernovas only last a few weeks, being able to constantly observe them will make his research more thorough, he said.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested from the theoretical side of new data the network will provide,” he said.</p>\n<p>Rosing said once the project is completed, the telescope will allow researchers to respond to satellite reports of activity in the atmosphere instantaneously. Since LCOGT will place telescopes in locations all over the world with different time zones, Rosing said it will not matter what time of the day it is; it is always dark enough to observe the sky in at least one location.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have the first capability ever implemented at being able to do a very long series of observations of things that go bump in the night,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Rosing, such 24-hour surveillance will allow the scientific community to learn new facts about the stars. For example, he said that currently the vibrations of new stars can only be watched for about eight hours at a time. Without being able to watch the star for 24 hours straight, astronomers cannot fully understand the frequency of the star’s oscillation, he said.</p>\n<p>Space Is the Place: The Journey Ahead</p>\n<p>By the end of 2012, Rosing said his global telescope network will consist of approximately 40 0.4-meter telescopes, 20 one-meter telescopes and two two-meter telescopes. Currently, Bildsten said there is no standard size for telescopes, but the biggest ones are 10 meters, located at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Matt Dubberly, an LCOGT mechanical engineer, said a one-meter telescope will collect 100 centimeters of light, which is a much greater amount of light than the human eye can handle. On average, the human pupil is between 5.5-0.8 millimeters in diameter.</p>\n<p>Dubberly also said that all the one-meter and two-meter telescopes will be attached to 16 megapixel spectral cameras.</p>\n<p>“The cameras are 1,000 times more sensitive than your eye,” Dubberly said. “They get really high resolution pictures of faint objects out in space.”</p>\n<p>LCOGT Scientific Director Tim Brown said the sites for the telescopes were determined by how easy it would be to transport the telescopes, and whether or not Internet connectivity was possible. He said it is important to have Internet connectivity because the telescopes must be able to send information back to the database in Goleta.</p>\n<p>“[The telescopes] will be independent in the sense that each one can point anywhere in the sky at any target that’s visible to it at anytime,” Brown said. “But it will all be controlled from a central location.”</p>\n<p>The telescopes can also follow instructions sent from the central computer in Goleta and observe the same targets, he said.</p>\n<p>Bildsten said most sites will have three one-meter telescopes in case one breaks down. Brown said having three one-meter telescopes on each site will allow LCOGT to conduct different studies simultaneously in fields such as photometry, in which researchers study light intensity, and spectroscopy – the study of a material’s chemical composition via the light emitted.</p>\n<p>LCOGT will complete the first prototype for the one-meter telescopes by early 2009, Rosing said. By the end of 2010, the organization will deploy all the 0.4-meter telescopes, and by 2012, it will place all of the one-meter telescopes. Currently, LCOGT manages the two two-meter telescopes, called the Faulkes Telescope North – located at Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii – and the Faulkes Telescope South – located at the Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales, Australia.</p>\n<p>In addition to building telescopes, Rosing said the organization will require large amounts of data space to store all the information collected by the telescopes.</p>\n<p>“[The telescopes] will be generating a few hundred gigs a night of information, which will flow back to the large cluster computing facility,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>Even after all the telescopes are deployed, Rosing said the group must continue to maintain them by building and installing better cameras as detective technology improves.</p>\n<p>“Our plan for the next 20 years is to study and do as much science as we can,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>Brown said site preparation expenses – pouring concrete, putting in power-lines, placing telescopes and acquiring permits – cost at least $50,000. In addition, he said the 0.4-meter telescopes cost around $50,000 each to build, and the one-meter telescopes cost approximately $1 million.</p>\n<p>Universe-ity Collaboration</p>\n<p>Sometime between late summer and early autumn, Brown said LCOGT will place a 0.8-meter telescope at the UCSB-managed Sedgwick Reserve, located in the Santa Ynez Valley. This telescope will have an eyepiece on it, which means spectators can look through it, he said.</p>\n<p>Rosing said he chose to deploy a telescope at Sedgwick because LCOGT needed a large telescope to test and a relatively close dark sky site to test it.</p>\n<p>“After discussing it, it was obvious to us that making a telescope available to UCSB astronomers and students in general was an added benefit,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>In addition, Rosing said Sedgwick has many outreach programs and a telescope would benefit those programs.</p>\n<p>“Part of the night is what goes on up in the sky, and it would be nice to be able to see it,” Rosing said. “We can do that from Sedgwick because it’s dark.”</p>\n<p>Rosing said the majority of engineering and manufacturing and all the software developments are done within LCOGT. However, he said LCOGT has an extensive collaboration in the astronomy field, including seven to 10 postdoctoral fellows connected with UC astrophysicists, UCSB, the University of Hawaii, UC Berkeley and the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</p>\n<p>In addition, Brown said LCOGT works with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope – an eight-meter telescope that will survey the entire sky and be operational in five years. Brown said the project also has other collaborations, including SuperWASP, a British organization that searches for new planets.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15987\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15987\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/","id":3567,"author":{"id":344,"name":"Sabrina Ricci"},"related":[3566,3565,3564],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gang Busters","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While some residents worry about a growing epidemic, other local organizers and prosecutors are committing themselves to decreasing gang violence in Santa Barbara and its surrounding areas.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Following the March 14 State Street stabbing that led to 15-year-old Luis Angel Linares’s death, Santa Barbara has seen a rise in reports concerning gang violence: In July, 16-year-old Lorenzo Valentin Carachure was found stabbed to death; in August, Santa Barbara police arrested 40 individuals who were allegedly tied to gangs; in November, three alleged gang members and another accomplice were arrested on charges of a Mesa robbery; and in January, an alleged gang stabbing occurred near Alice Keck Park Memorial Gardens. While some residents worry about a growing epidemic, other local organizers and prosecutors are committing themselves to decreasing gang violence in Santa Barbara and its surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>Gang Facts</p>\n<p>\tAccording to District Attorney Hilary Dozer, the southern region of Santa Barbara County is home to about five to seven major gangs and 1,200 gang members. He also said that while many gang members in the area are of Latino descent, the county also has its few white supremacist and black gangs. He also said that an all-female gang exists and is known as the Nightowls.<br>\n\t“We do have women that affiliate with gangs, but in terms of committing crimes, they’re less likely to do that,” Dozer said. “But I have been in court with some women [who committed crimes] that I would not want to be on the receiving end of.”<br>\n\tThe two largest gangs in the area are the Eastside Gangsters and Westside Destroyers that claim separate divisions of the city. Dozer said Goleta is mostly claimed by the G-13 (Goleta-13) and it has many subsets called groupings.<br>\n\tHe said, generally, the gangs get along except when they “slip” into each other’s territories.<br>\n\t“Gangs between Eastside and Westside Goleta are relatively even, but it could change six months from now,” Dozer said.<br>\n\tDan McSkimming, a senior deputy for the County Sheriff’s Dept. Gang Unit, said that other incidents occur when one gang feels injured or insulted by another.<br>\n\t“It’s almost always gang versus gang, or if not, someone’s in the wrong place at the wrong time, or it’s an associate that crosses them,” McSkimming said.<br>\n\tDozer said that while most gang violence is gang on gang, civilians can also get injured. The G-13 grouping called the Lakotes claim Isla Vista and are responsible for some of the gang violence near the university.<br>\n\t“Students need to be aware that crime takes place everywhere,” Dozer said. “Including the ivory towers of UCSB.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Crime and Punishment</p>\n<p>\tDozer said that three prosecutors, himself included, focus on gang crime.<br>\n\t“The D.A. targets gang crime with the highest prosecution,” Dozer said.<br>\n\tHe said gang-related crimes receive harsher punishments as the result of the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act. The S.T.E.P. Act was developed in the late 1980s in an attempt to deal with the tremendous amount of inter-gang war in Los Angeles County. Dozer said that in 1992, L.A. County had about 1,000 gang-related murders. S.T.E.P. made it criminal and prosecutable to be in a gang for a person who knows the gang is committing crimes.<br>\n\tDozer said that while he believes gang violence is at a high right now, it will lessen with the help of community members who report crime.<br>\n\t“In my 15 years of experience, gang activity ebbs and flows until it gets to a high point, which I think is now, but it goes away,” Dozer said.<br>\n\tMatt Sanchez, leader for the after-school youth program All For One, said he is a former gang member and that while most people think gang violence is an escalating problem, in Santa Barbara it is actually a small part of reported crime, with many of the offenders being minors.<br>\n\t“I call it youth violence because gang violence makes people think the public is in harm’s way, but it’s not against civilians, it’s gang on gang,” he said.<br>\n\tSanchez also said he first joined a gang when he was 16 and eventually became a leader of a gang called the Hoods. He said a lot of his family was also involved in gangs.<br>\n\t“It cost my brother his life and after that, hopelessness made me push the envelope. What was the point of going on?” Sanchez said.<br>\n\tHe said he served time for armed robbery, drugs, firearms and three times for attempted murder, though, he said, none of these crimes were gang-related. He said the only thing that made him stop was the fear that his children would follow in his footsteps.<br>\n\t“I saw my kids growing up and starting to emulate me, and I said no,” Sanchez said.</p>\n<p>Young Gangsters<br>\n\tThe average age of gang members is between 14 and 15, and it is not unusual for kids to start associating with gangs in elementary school, Dozer said.<br>\n\t“When you’re young, you’re put to work or do things for other gang members,” Dozer said. “But it’s not surprising to find gang members in their 20s. Longtime members are called veteranos.”<br>\n\tMcSkimming said the gang unit tries to influence kids in grammar school the most, since they are the most likely to join and are actually the most violent.<br>\n\t“The younger ones are often the most violent because they are trying to make a name for themselves,” McSkimming said. “The older ones are the shot callers, and the younger ones are doing violence to make names for themselves.”<br>\n\tVincent Castro, a first-year Santa Barbara City College student, said a great deal of his extended family was involved in gangs. He said he had trouble in his immediate family and was 10 when he first became involved with a gang.<br>\n\t“The gang was really my family because my family was not there,” Castro said. “I was 10 years old when a gang member got me high for the first time.”<br>\n\tHe said he was 14 when he started committing crimes for the gang and about 16 when he first met Matt Sanchez at All For One, formerly Hoods in the Woods. He said the workshops with Sanchez helped him the most.</p>\n<p>Juvi<br>\n\tYoung detainees charged with intense gang-related offenses are sent to the Santa Barbara Juvenile Hall. Facility Manager Karen Wheeler said the juvenile hall has 19 detainees filling the 20 single bedrooms available. She said while many detainees associate with gangs, only a few are actually in juvenile hall due to gang-related crime.<br>\n\t“Approximately 20 percent or less of the total number of minors on probation … are there for crimes that are gang related,” Wheeler said. “And a percentage of those in custody that claim a gang are higher than 20 percent.”<br>\n\tShe said the typical day in the life of a detainee involves going to school at the juvenile facility that teaches traditional high school subjects, participating in supervised physical education, having supervised showers and attending programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Wheeler said S.T.E.P. applies to juveniles as well.<br>\n\t“We have a zero-gang-tolerance policy,” Wheeler said. “The penalties are court approved, and the detainees know if they’re engaged [in gang activity] there’s a penalty.”</p>\n<p>A Solution</p>\n<p>\tFormer gang members Matt Sanchez and Vincent Castro are working together at the program All For One to keep kids out of gangs and out of juvenile hall. Co-created by Sanchez in 1992, All For One has about 50 members that meet every week, discuss their problems and participate in activities.<br>\n\t“We try to teach them responsibility. … We help them with their homework, find a school; we look for their gift, their special talent, and capitalize on that through education or working,” Sanchez said.<br>\n\tThe group consists of mainly high school-aged boys. Castro said he joined the group when he was 16 and now is the project coordinator. He said he thinks more programs like All For One would reduce gang numbers and that Sanchez helped him quit.<br>\n\t“When I went to juvi, I was just thinking, ‘Oh man, I let Matt down,'” Castro said. “He really motivated me to do right.”<br>\n\tCastro said he mentors a lot of the boys, going to the neighborhoods to recruit and educate. He said there is some hostility between kids from different parts of town when they first join the group, but the main rule in the program is to have respect for everyone, so they get over it fast. Castro said even he had a beef with a student at SBCC because he was from the other side of town, but they made amends when Castro became a leader for All For One.<br>\n\t“I told him, ‘We helped start it, homes, why can’t we stop it?'” Castro said.<br>\n\tSanchez said he has high hopes for the club and cares most about making the club sustainable so future generations can benefit from its programs.<br>\n\t“It’s easier to swim down current, but it takes somebody with real courage to swim against the current,” Sanchez said. “Sometimes it’s harder to do the right thing.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/","id":3563,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[3562,3561,3560],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"You’re Paying for the View","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With a beautiful view of the ocean, sunny weather and a campus within walking distance, it is no surprise that thousands of UCSB students crowd into Isla Vista each year like clowns into a circus car....","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a beautiful view of the ocean, sunny weather and a campus within walking distance, it is no surprise that thousands of UCSB students crowd into Isla Vista each year like clowns into a circus car. However, these luxuries do come at a price – literally. Although the national housing market continues to plummet, housing in Isla Vista continues to become costly, with the average monthly rate for a two-bedroom apartment having risen over $200 from 2006-07 to 2007-08. As students begin their housing quests this month, many are gradually becoming aware of this trend.</p>\n<p>Sky High Prices in Flight</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Community Housing Office Manager Roane Akchurin, the January rush for housing started earlier and heavier than normal this year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It is based on supply and demand, and the January craze is those bigger apartments,” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>In I.V., the monthly rental average for a two-bedroom unit based on 214 listings was $2,263 for 2007-08. However, in 2006-07, the monthly rental average for a two-bedroom unit was $2,022 based on 146 listings – an average jump of $241.</p>\n<p>St. George and Associates Manager Terri Bailey said the high demand for I.V. housing keeps the rent rising. She said her company owns all its properties – although some are partnerships – and that it tries to remodel often and add amenities to its available housing to make the costs more appealing.</p>\n<p>However, Isla Vista Tenants Union Chairman Gerson Sorto said that, while he approves of increased housing quality, he still believes many I.V. apartments are overpriced. Sorto, a fourth-year political science major, also said these price rises were difficult to curb.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult when landlords have so much power,” Sorto said. “They have to adhere to certain standards, but they’re not that strict.”</p>\n<p>With regards to UCSB, Sorto said he would like to see the university put pressure on landlords to keep prices lower. He said the high rents discourage low-income students from attending UCSB.</p>\n<p>Yet, UCSB Housing and Residential Services Executive Director Wilfred Brown said private renting is just that: private.</p>\n<p>“It’s not like the university can go in there and tell the landlords what to price their property,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Meridian Group Management Co. President Robert Kooyman said his company manages about 220 units in I.V. for a large variety of private owners, so it is not always the managers in charge of price raises.</p>\n<p>“People think the managing company makes all the rules, but a lot of it is the owners,” Kooyman said.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, the university is not entirely dissolved from I.V. It owns properties such as I.V. Theater and Embarcadero Hall and will lease land to the new Isla Vista Foot Patrol Office on 6504 Trigo Road. The university is also funding half of the I.V. Master Plan, which will pay for remodeled storefronts, multi-story buildings and bike loops, as well as renovated sidewalks and parks.</p>\n<p>Still, some areas in I.V. continue to have higher prices than others. In particular, Bailey said some rents are often influenced by the ocean-facing – and party-loving – Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t take a rate increase on everything,” Bailey said. “One person sets prices on DP, and that affects everyone else’s price level.”</p>\n<p>DP Dollars</p>\n<p>DP’s oceanfront location and party hard reputation has, hands down, made it the most popular street to live on in I.V. Many students also consider living on the “Party Street” as a rite of passage at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“DP is the most sought after street,” Bailey said. “It really sets the tone for all of I.V.”</p>\n<p>Kooyman said his company manages a few properties on DP and that such units often carry with them incredibly large liability issues. He said many of his company’s tenants break their leases mid-year. Common complaints include loud music and parking problems.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, James Gelb is a private landlord of many I.V. properties, including 14 on DP Gelb said DP generally costs about 10 percent higher than the rest of I.V. in return for the ocean view. He said he sets his prices based on the number of people trying to rent from him.</p>\n<p>“The price raise is dictated on supply and demand,” Gelb said.</p>\n<p>Gelb, like many I.V. landlords or managers, is a UCSB alum himself and said he enjoys renting to students because they are good tenants and are timely on their payments. He said the key to continuing business is maintaining good property management, good service and good prices.</p>\n<p>An Inconvenient Number</p>\n<p>Due to the high demand for I.V. housing, though, “good pricing” has become a very gray area. Akchurin said she was amazed at how high the rent prices have gone up and said the only way for students to make an impact on the cost is to not live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“At some point you have to ask, who’s setting the game?” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>While the average rent rate is going up for the whole of I.V., there are a few extreme cases of rates rising by four digits. Bret Smith, a second-year mechanical engineering major, said he and his current housemates will not renew their lease on Abrego with St. George because their rent will be too high.</p>\n<p>“We want to live closer to DP plus they’re raising the rent by $1,000, so that would make it impossible to live here,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Smith said St. George sent him a letter explaining that his two-bedroom doubles would become triples next school year, making the rent go up by $1,000.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how they expect six people to live here with one bathroom,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Akchurin said because leases are one-year only, landlords can legally raise the rent to however much they want.</p>\n<p>“Because they’re new contracts, there’s not a barrier on that,” Akchurin said. “It’s whatever the market will bear, unfortunately.”</p>\n<p>Beth Goodman, a second-year political science major, lives in a one-bedroom apartment in the same building. She said she also received a letter from St. George, but that her apartment’s rent would increase from  $1,400 per month to $1,800 per month.</p>\n<p>“They said they want four people in the singles, and we have two people now,” Goodman said. “For the one bedroom, that’s ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>St. George declined to comment on that particular rent raise.</p>\n<p>San Clemente the Savior?</p>\n<p>Despite, the raising prices, Akchurin said I.V. landlords may see some new competition with the opening of UCSB’s San Clemente Village located along El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>“Word on the street is that they’re afraid of the impacts of San Clemente,” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>The two-bedroom and four-bedroom apartments will house 964 graduate and transfer students, each with their own single bedroom. Rent at San Clemente will cost $723 per person for the four single-bedroom apartment or $831 per person for the two single-bedroom apartment. The price includes utilities, cable and Internet.</p>\n<p>However, Kooyman said he is actually glad San Clemente will open because it will offer students affordable housing.</p>\n<p>“When the university builds housing, it helps students,” Kooyman said. “The university doesn’t pay property tax, and that’s high. You cut that out, and you save 30 percent. All things we struggle to get, they have set up state of the art.”</p>\n<p>Kooyman said the only things he does not like about San Clemente is that it was built on top of Storke Field. He said he would rather see I.V. infill than spread out, so as to maintain the surrounding greenery and views.</p>\n<p>Gelb said he is not worried about the structure affecting his business and even looks forward to the competition.</p>\n<p>“We thrive on competition, it’s the American way of doing business,” Gelb said. “I’m not afraid of it, and I encourage it.”</p>\n<p> Brown said the school plans on building more structures like San Clemente in the future, with housing development plans in the works on Ocean Road as well as 90 units of housing planned for the north knoll of the recently purchased Devereux land.</p>\n<p>Go Go Goleta</p>\n<p>According to a CHO survey, in Fall 2007, 6,175 undergraduate students lived in UCSB residences, 2,008 lived in Goleta, 8,660 lived in I.V. and 1,884 lived in Santa Barbara. In Goleta, a two-bedroom apartment is about $1,550, nearly $1000 less than a two-bedroom in I.V.</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole other market that’s missing from students’ minds in Goleta,” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>Most contracts in Goleta are month-to-month versus the twelve month lease in I.V. Students who want to live in Goleta have many more options available to them in June, instead of signing up in January for a lease that starts in June.</p>\n<p>“We’ve created this nightmare market in I.V. where people sign contracts in January for June,” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>Sorto said another problem with living in I.V. is the community does not have a collective memory.</p>\n<p>“There is a significant percentage I consider to be long term residents like low-income families and professors, but the mass majority of the population leaves in like five years, and that really affects I.V.,” he said.</p>\n<p>As for the future, Gelb said the community must collaborate in order to keep I.V. more stable.</p>\n<p>“Students and landlords should work in cooperation with each other,” Gelb said. “We’re both on the same side. We want good housing.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15631\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15631\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/","id":3558,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[3557,3556,3555],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A-B-C, Easy as 1-2-3?\nSaturday, Jan. 12, 12:29 a.m. - On Embarcadero del Norte, a group of men yelling at each other attracted the attention of a large crowd, and, eventually, the Isla Vista Foot Patr...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A-B-C, Easy as 1-2-3?<br>\nSaturday, Jan. 12, 12:29 a.m. – On Embarcadero del Norte, a group of men yelling at each other attracted the attention of a large crowd, and, eventually, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>The officers spotted a 23-year-old man who had actually had a run-in with I.V.’s finest earlier that night. The reason: an inappropriate tirade of deafening insults.</p>\n<p>The man – who seemed to have his vocal dial turned up to 11 – told the deputies that he just wanted to go home, all the while trying to dip, duck and dodge the questions thrown his way.</p>\n<p>He managed to count how many shots he’d had that night – eight- but could not seem to remember his alphabet for the officers.</p>\n<p>After several earnest attempts, trying such letter combinations as the commonly mistaken “K-I-Z” and the just barely incorrect “U-P,” he admitted to the officers, “No, I cannot say my ABCs.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication, and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending successful completion of his 1-2-3s.</p>\n<p>She’s a Lady<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 1:21 a.m. – After receiving a call from residents on Camino del Sur that a woman was face down on the grass throwing up, an IVFP officer found the19-year-old.</p>\n<p>When the deputy approached the woman, she managed to compose herself enough to speak, and, as the officer noted, was exceedingly polite.</p>\n<p>Despite her good manners, the woman proved a bit untrustworthy. She told the officer that she had gone to a party with her friends, but that like all underage students at UCSB, she only drank water.</p>\n<p>The woman, who had soiled her jeans, repeatedly denied drinking any alcohol. Her story, however, proved about as watertight as a pasta strainer when a test administrated by the deputies showed her blood alcohol content level at .212.</p>\n<p>Once the woman realized she was caught in a lie, she apologized profusely for causing trouble and gracefully faced her night in jail, wet pants and all.</p>\n<p>Close Encounters of the Leafy Kind<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 12:52 a.m. – Officers patrolling Sabado Tarde Road saw a woman stumble down the street, lose her balance and run straight into a bush.</p>\n<p>Refusing to let a mere shrub get the best of her, the 19-year-old woman recovered, brushed away the stray twigs from her hair, and continued down the street.</p>\n<p>When confronted by the deputies, the woman said she was coming from a party on Sueno Road and that all she had to drink was a beer and a shot.</p>\n<p>The officer questioned the validity of her alcohol consumption, and asked the woman if she had any more to drink.

Quickly, the bloodshot eyes and strong odor of alcohol led the officer to suspect a high level of intoxication. Also, she was not wearing shoes. The officer kindly asked the woman to sit on the curb until he finished his prior engagement with the unfortunate driver.</p>\n<p>Having let the vehicle go, he turned to the woman and asked what she needed. The woman, apparently following George Washington’s famed maxim, replied, “I’m drunk, I’m not going to lie.” When asked just how much she had drunk, the woman continued to show her truthful side, confessing, “[A] lot.”</p>\n<p>“I drink too much,” she added.</p>\n<p>When asked to stand up, her bare feet were unable to provide the necessary balance and the officer decided to arrest her.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>See Spot Drink…</p>\n<p>Saturday, Dec. 29, 2:00 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 700 block of Camino del Sur happened across a woman screaming and waving her arm in the air with a man behind her holding on to her shoulder.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached in their patrol car, the male subject left the agitated woman behind and proceeded to walk in the opposite direction at a brisk pace, looking back once to check out the situation.</p>\n<p>The officer, fearing the man would flee, sprung to action, jumping out of the car while yelling at him to come back. He did, albeit not as briskly as before.</p>\n<p>The officer started slapping handcuffs onto the subject, suspecting a possible assault. Suddenly the officer noticed that the man’s arrest was angering the woman. “You’re fucking arresting him?” she screamed out in a slurred and incoherent voice.</p>\n<p>The officer turned his attention to the 19-year-old woman, who he quickly determined was heavily intoxicated. Further questioning revealed the underling reason for her highly agitated state. Ignoring all the officer’s questions, the woman instead asked him, “Is my dog hurt?”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the drunken canine lover’s responses continued to involve her dog, despite the absence of any furry friends within the area.</p>\n<p>Further inquiry into the subject revealed that the 21-year-old man was a co-worker of hers who had simply offered to walk his friend home. The alcohol, however, had apparently blacked out any concrete memory of where she lived and the two wandered up and down the entire length of Camino del Sur for nearly an hour before they stumbled upon Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she spent the night in the doghouse, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Transporter<br>\nTuesday, Jan. 1, 12:35 a.m. – Choosing to roost between a hard place and a bush, a 20-year-old female woke up for the first time in 2008 to the glare of a Foot Patrol flashlight.</p>\n<p>Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive came across a woman wedged between a tall bush and a parked truck, seemingly asleep yet still standing. Her belt was half off and she seemed to have lost her shoes.</p>\n<p>When approached by deputies, the motionless woman mumbled, “I’m not driving them home.” When asked what she was doing, she repeated, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>Officers informed her that her sleep aid – the truck next to her – was empty, and no one else was present. The distinct lack of anyone to drive did not quell her concern, however. When asked why her belt was half off, she announced, much to officers’ surprise, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the woman to step out from between the truck and the bush and onto the sidewalk. Balance, however, was not the would-be-driver’s forte, and she stumbled and fell into the officer’s arms.</p>\n<p>The sleepy souse had a few fresh scratches on her arm, but was unable to explain their presence to the officer, apparently forgetting her recent stint in a bush.</p>\n<p>The women was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/","id":3871,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3870,3869,3868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Billion Dollar Building Plan","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB is currently in the middle of a $1 billion capital program to construct new buildings and revamp infrastructure.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB is currently in the middle of a $1 billion capital program to construct new buildings and revamp infrastructure.

Campus Design and Facilities Associate Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher said by the end of 2008, the campus will also see construction for the San Clemente Graduate Student Housing project, Noble Hall, the Arts Building, the Loma Paloma multipurpose building at Manzanita Village and the new East Gate.</p>\n<p>Capital Development Director Martie Levy said despite large campus expansions in the past, this current development is the largest and most expensive in the university’s history.</p>\n<p>“What’s triggered this [growth] is [the fact that] it has been almost 20 years and the student body has grown from 12,000 to 20,000,” Levy said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the Long Haul</p>\n<p>University of California campuses use what is known as the Long-Range Development Plan to strategize the creation of new facilities and services for a growing campus. The LRDP also defines how a campus will accommodate students and staff without excessively damaging coastal resources.</p>\n<p>Fisher said the LDRP plan includes new academic buildings, additional faculty and staff, more student housing, new recreational space, higher quality public space and restoration of natural habitats, as well as modernized walkways, roads and bike paths.</p>\n<p>“For example, we are proposing adding 5,000 beds of student housing and approximately 1,800 units of faculty and staff housing,” Fisher said.</p>\n<p>UCSB representatives will present the campus’ LDRP to the University of California Board of Regents for certification this coming spring before it is submitted to the California Coastal Commission for approval. The CCC focuses on protecting California’s coastal environment and regulating the use of land and water in the coastal zone. Development and construction activities usually require a coastal permit from the CCC before staff can break ground. The CCC is particular about building plans and often requires groups to revise their proposals.</p>\n<p>“The process of review with the California Coastal Commission should be six to 12 months,” Fisher said. “The first buildings proposed in the plan could begin construction after approvals from the Coastal Commission.”</p>\n<p>The university’s plan, also known as UCSB Vision 2025, centers on university development for the next 20 years. During the last several months, Fisher said UCSB has presented its LRDP to the community at various meetings.</p>\n<p>“The public reaction has been very favorable,” Fisher said. “The plan proposes a sustainable and forward thinking live-work model that the community is very interested in.”</p>\n<p>Multi-Million Dollar Baby</p>\n<p>The consulting and approval process by planners, deans, committees, the chancellor and the Board of Regents takes years, though the most challenging part about building and renovating UCSB facilities is the cost, despite the high revenue the university attains, Fisher said.</p>\n<p>“The most difficult issue facing campus construction has been the escalation of cost over the past four years,” Fisher said. “This escalation has impacted our ability to move projects forward as quickly as we would like.”</p>\n<p>Levy said building construction and maintenance is usually paid with mandated student fees, donations or bonds. Academic buildings are paid for through state approved funds and from private donations.</p>\n<p>One structure funded largely by donations is the Carsey-Wolf Center for Film, Television and New Media, which is currently under development. The project received huge monetary gifts from such celebrities as “Law &amp; Order” series creator Dick Wolf, UCSB alumnus and Oscar-winner Michael Douglas and “Cosby Show” producer Marcy Carsey.</p>\n<p>Levy said the most expensive project under construction right now is the San Clemente student housing facility on El Colegio Road. The project has an estimated final cost of $143 million, making it the most expensive facility UCSB has ever built. Another project, concerning renovations and additions to the Davidson Library, will serve as the second most expensive building venture. The estimated $60 million library project will begin within the next two years.</p>\n<p>Lean, Green Building Machine</p>\n<p>As UCSB continues to expand campus facilities, it is also including energy efficient renovations to its list of projects. It is one of three universities in the nation participating in the pilot stage of the new energy efficient rating system created by the U.S. Green Building Council. The Leadership for in Energy and Environmental Design certification program includes awards for eco-friendly projects in two categories: new construction and building renovations. A LEED certified building must conserve water and energy, and reduce waste and greenhouse gas emissions, among other qualifications.</p>\n<p>According the U.S. Green Building Council’s Web site, “LEED certification provides independent, third-party verification that a building project meets the highest green building and performance measures. All certified projects receive a LEED plaque, which is the nationally recognized symbol demonstrating that a building is environmentally responsible, profitable and a healthy place to live and work.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said UCSB’s Bren Hall is the first LEED certified green building in the UC system. Bren Hall received a platinum level LEED, the highest certification possible, and is the greenest laboratory building in the United States. He said it does not take longer to construct green buildings, nor does it cost much more.</p>\n<p>“The Campus has made a commitment to achieve LEED certification through the U.S. Green Building Council at the Silver Level for all new campus buildings,” Fisher said. “In addition we are working to certify a group of 25 existing buildings in the LEED for Existing Buildings program as part of our commitment to improve existing buildings.”</p>\n<p>The Destiny of Devereux</p>\n<p>In addition to its green efforts, the university has also increased its size. UCSB recently purchased the remaining 33-acres of the Devereux Foundation land on Sept. 28, 2007. Fisher said the land will be developed but the Devereux School, a facility that provides residence and rehabilitation services for people with developmental disabilities or neurological disorders, will remain in its current location on the north knoll of the Devereux site as a long-term tenant to the university.</p>\n<p>“A preliminary plan shows 90 units of housing on the north knoll and 200,000 gross square feet of academic space on the south knoll,” Fisher said. “The area north of Devereux includes approximately 50 units of housing, expansion space for childcare and additional campus recreation fields.”</p>\n<p>The Devereux Slough, which is located on the Coal Oil Point Natural Reserve next to the newly purchased site, will not, however, see development. The Associated Students Coastal Fund recently allocated a $4,000 grant to the Devereux Slough Monitoring Program to create a database for animal and plant life as well as monitoring environmental conditions of the slough.</p>\n<p>Levy said despite UCSB’s need to expand, preserving some natural environments is vital to the university.</p>\n<p>“It is important to research programs and from a biological point of view,” Levy said. “It is also important to the ecology of the state of California.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Dreamin’</p>\n<p>The university is also taking part in developing Isla Vista. Levy said besides owning buildings in I.V., like I.V. Theater and Embarcadero Hall, the campus also enhances the community with other projects like leasing the land at no cost for the new Isla Vista Foot Patrol building, which will relocate from Pardall Road to 6504 Trigo Rd. The school is also intensely involved in the Isla Vista Master Plan.</p>\n<p>“[The] Campus funded half of the Master Plan for I.V. so obviously we’re invested in I.V.” Levy said.</p>\n<p>The 736-page long IVMP has been in the making since 2000, and will modernize I.V. by changing zoning codes, beautifying the downtown area and renovating parks and roadways throughout I.V.</p>\n<p>Fisher said the new university housing buildings will help to relieve the impacted student residence halls and help to preserve the diverse community of students and families.</p>\n<p>“I believe that the campus would prefer I.V. to develop as a diverse community,” Fisher said. “This diversity would include students, faculty and staff, as well as off-campus residents.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/","id":3557,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[3556,3555,3554],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Siesta, Fiesta and Flying Tomatoes","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I never guessed that coming to Spain meant I would learn more sign language than Spanish.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I never guessed that coming to Spain meant I would learn more sign language than Spanish. Apparently pointing to your crotch and doing “the potty dance” is universal for “Where are the restrooms?” Once, my friend Danielle tried to tell our adviser that she had a sinus infection and accidentally said she had a breast infection. Only when she pointed to the center of her face did he understand what she meant.</p>\n<p>While I struggle to learn Spanish there are, however, two words here I understand clearly: siesta and fiesta. From 2 to 5 p.m. everyday, most stores close for naptime. If I walk the streets between these hours, it feels as though a nuclear war might begin and I am the only one not hiding in an underground shelter. I haven’t slept through the middle of the day since kindergarten, so at first, a three-hour nap did not feel natural. Coming from a capitalist country where most stores are open until around 9 p.m. doesn’t help either. But, when you party until sunrise five days a week, I think the siesta is essential for survival. Did I mention that the sun does not come up until after 8 a.m.?</p>\n<p>I stood outside the window of a restaurant during siesta once and I felt like that woman from that Mervyns commercial as I opened and closed my hands repeating, “open, open, open.” Not even a hungry-looking face pities them into prying the doors open early. As they say here, “No me hagas una cara de cordero degollado,” which means don’t pout at me, but literally translated means, “Don’t make the face of a decapitated lamb.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sadness and siesta aside, the Spanish fiesta more than atones for the times I have gone hungry during the middle of the day. Without a doubt, Alcalá de Henares – my study center city just outside of Madrid – knows everything about merrymaking. One minute giant puppets parade the streets, the next a Renaissance Fair arrives to sell handcrafted swords, grilled ribs, and herbs to cure flatulence and impotency. We actually had a day off school to celebrate Miguel de Cervantes, the famed writer of Don Quixote.</p>\n<p>Additionally, only in Spain can you ditch your Education Abroad Program orientation discipline lecture to attend the largest food fight in the world – La Tomatina. Playing with food is a common childhood activity for most, a sexual fantasy for some and an annual extravaganza for the entire population of Buñol, a small town outside of Valencia. Every year approximately 20,000 people crowd into the narrow cobblestone streets of this city to launch 8 tons of tomatoes at each other for exactly one hour. Longing desperately to relive childhood memories of mixing ketchup and other condiments at the dinner table, I chose to embark on this adventure a couple of months ago, but not without last minute preparation, of course.</p>\n<p>Since the bus to Buñol didn’t leave until 5 a.m. we had no choice but to head directly to Madrid and dance until our estimated time of departure. Unfortunately, the two guys that accompanied my girl friends and me exhausted their money on alcohol. When the bus came, we could hardly scrape together sufficient funds for transportation. As such, we had a mere 5 euros to spend on food for the day. At the gas station, we bought two pieces of white bread each and one bottle of water. Hungry once again, I hoped my starvation might prompt the necessary hostility to vigorously launch tomatoes, or tom-ah-toes as some say.</p>\n<p>Either way, it is difficult to speak when you stand atop a white van and a solid green tomato flies 20 miles per hour at your face. Yes, the impact does hurt, especially since I did not carry ammo. I did not bring a shield, and the only defense I had against the other tomato throwers was quick wit and my uncanny ability to curl up and fit into small spaces. I may have done more fleeing than fighting that day, but I came out of that tomato war alive, though smelly, and ready to take advantage of the many other Spanish cultural activities.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15239\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-26/siesta-fiesta-and-flying-tomatoes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15239\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-26/siesta-fiesta-and-flying-tomatoes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-26/siesta-fiesta-and-flying-tomatoes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-26/siesta-fiesta-and-flying-tomatoes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-26/siesta-fiesta-and-flying-tomatoes/","id":3556,"author":{"id":343,"name":"Megan Snedden"},"related":[3555,3554,3553],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat, Nov. 3, 12:49 a.m. - Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed a man staggering down the street.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Sat, Nov. 3, 12:49 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed a man staggering down the street.</p>\n<p>The man lost his balance several times, falling to the ground, before standing up and trying again.</p>\n<p>As a deputy observed the man, he saw that the subject was about to fall and kindly ran to catch him.

For nearly a decade in the late 19th century, the land now occupied by UCSB hosted packs of miners picking and blasting at the rich asphalt deposit that runs along the Goleta coastline. The asphalt mined here was then used to pave streets and seal roofs in Goleta and other regions around the country.</p>\n<p>A Brief History of UCSB</p>\n<p>The beautifully landscaped campus students now call UCSB has passed through many hands over the centuries. The Chumash tribe originally lived on the land, and according to documentation from the Santa Barbara Museum Historical Society, even had permanent settlements near Cheadle Hall and the 217 entrance to UCSB. Later, under Mexican rule, portions of California lands, including Goleta, became available for purchase by private buyers. In the 1890s, a group of Englishmen started the Alcatraz Asphaltum Company and took over the land after it became windswept. The now filled-in mine shafts lie between the University Art Museum and the Faculty Club on campus. At the turn of the century, the mine was abandoned and the land went through several owners until 1942 when World War II led to the creation of a military base in the area. In 1950, the University of California Board of Regents purchased the base and in 1954 opened a liberal arts school known as the UC Santa Barbara College, a name that was later shortened to UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Getting the Shaft</p>\n<p>The Alcatraz Asphaltum Mine operated from 1890 to1898 on the site of the present day UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>Senior Campus Planner Dennis Whelan said a fenced area blocks the filled-in entrance to the main vertical shaft.</p>\n<p>“They are generally located in the area between the Faculty Club, Hatlen Theater and the Arts Building,” Whelan said. “A fenced area is clearly visible from the service road between the Faculty Club and Hatlen Theater, now heavily overgrown with ivy. The horizontal shafts ran in several directions laterally around this vertical shaft.”</p>\n<p>The Alcatraz Asphaltum Company leased the 400-acre tract of land from then-owner Mr. August Den. The mine employed 50 men ranging from local boys to experienced gold miners to quarrelsome transients. In one document from the Santa Barbara Museum Historical Society, historian Horace Sexton described the working conditions as long and arduous.</p>\n<p>“The men worked shifts of 10 hours each, two shifts making up the day’s work,” Sexton wrote. “The change-overs were at 7:00 a.m. and at 4:30 p.m. They came up for an hour at noon looking like blackened gnomes.”</p>\n<p>The mine paid $2.50 per day to the miners and $2 to the “muckers” who hauled dirt and shale out of the mine and loaded the asphalt onto cars sent to the main shaft. The miners and managers lived in bunkhouses and ate in a cook house on the site.</p>\n<p>When the mine first opened, no one managing had much experience, so the first shaft sunk crookedly some 200 ft. into the viscous asphalt itself, about 50 ft. from the lagoon.</p>\n<p>According to California Dept. of Conservation records, the deposit of asphalt was one of the purest examined, with the asphaltum being three to 12 ft. thick in some places. The walls were formed of slightly solidified clays, with distinct stratification.</p>\n<p>The asphalt would expand and harden when exposed to the air in the shaft, so it was decided a second shaft should stand in the shale alongside the vein of asphaltum as opposed into the vein itself. However, this second shaft was later deemed dangerous due to brackish water that kept seeping in and creating the potential for flooding in the shaft and skin infections.</p>\n<p>In his writings, Sexton stated that the mine was quite deep.</p>\n<p>“The horizontal tunnels, called ‘drifts,’ extended some 100 ft. to the ore body,” Sexton wrote. “These drifts were made every 50 vertical ft. to the final depth of the mine, some 550 ft.”</p>\n<p>The miners worked their way through the shafts by picking and blasting with dynamite. Besides the obvious blasting and seepage dangers, the mine was dangerous in other ways as well. Continuous streams of warm gas flowed from the asphaltum, and two men were even killed when their candles exploded in a pocket of gas. Their deaths established safety rules that had previously not existed. Cave-ins also occurred, injuring miners, and in one instance, impaling a worker on his own pick.</p>\n<p>At the height of production, the mine produced 60 tons of asphaltum daily. The product was transported all over the United States, and according to Sexton, it was “reliably reported that the streets of New Orleans were paved with asphaltum from the Goleta mine during those years.”</p>\n<p>The Alcatraz Asphaltum Company was later taken over by other companies and refined until 1898 when oil was deemed cheaper to produce and the Goleta mine was abandoned.</p>\n<p>Ross Brunetti, an engineer and geologist for the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, said many tar and asphalt mines existed in California until people discovered they could obtain oil from wells for much cheaper.</p>\n<p>“In 1901, the first major oil field opened and within a few years of that asphalt mining couldn’t pay out,” Brunetti said. “The whole state was so rich with oil from wells that mining asphalt was not economical until the energy crisis of the 1970s.”</p>\n<p>He said when the asphalt and tar mining industry collapsed, the workers oftentimes inadequately filled in the mines or simply left them open.</p>\n<p>“There was no requirement or incentive back then,” Brunetti said. “They’d just brush off their hands and walk away.”</p>\n<p>Mine for the Taking</p>\n<p>Today, students biking to class may have no knowledge of the sand-filled shafts that could rest below them, as the exact location of each filled-in shaft is indefinite.</p>\n<p>“Nobody knows precisely where they are,” Brunetti said.</p>\n<p>Whelan said a historic marker once stood before the ivy-covered square hedge near the Faculty Club. He also said the sign may have disappeared as the result of theft.</p>\n<p>“There was a historic site marker at the location,” Whelan said. “It is not there now.”</p>\n<p>While the asphalt mines on UCSB campus are filled, Brunetti said the state has many unmarked abandoned mines. When one is found, the Office of Mine Reclamation is informed and proceeds to fill it in for safety.</p>\n<p>“If it’s a vertical shaft, they will fill it in,” Brunetti said. “If it’s horizontal, they will put a grill over the entrance so bats can go in and out. This way it can remain a habitat.”</p>\n<p>Abandoned Mines Unit geologist Sarah Reeves said many factors affect the safety of abandoned mines. She said that if a mine were backfilled with sand and gravel versus clay, the mines are less stable.</p>\n<p>“It really depends on how extensive the underground workings are,” Reeves said. “The fill material can sometimes actually erode further into the mine and sink.”</p>\n<p>Though the Alcatraz Mines were probably filled with sand and dirt, Reeves said they are not likely to be dangerous because of the lack of evidence concerning sinkholes or moving foundations.</p>\n<p>“If you build something on an abandoned mine thinking it is safe because it is filled and pressure from the building makes the horizontal shafts move, the building can move, and that would be bad,” Reeves said. “It’s really a case by case basis.”</p>\n<p>Whelan said he is not worried about campus building foundations. He said UCSB takes mine shafts into consideration before constructing new buildings.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14963\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14963\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/","id":2185,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[2184,2183,2182],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Serving With the Surfriders","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"0500 hours: The lights of the first platoon barracks illuminate the room, still dark from the past evening.

Col. Martin E. Stokes said.</p>\n<p>0520 hours: The first formation of the day lines up for inspection while the stars provide the only light. It is here that both schools are divided equally into two platoons consisting of three squads each. The idea is to practice the formations, commands and protocol necessary for an officer in the Army.</p>\n<p>“Right face!” commands second platoon Sgt. Damaris Sanders. With this order, the long day ensues as the cadets undertake a full schedule of exercises aimed at team building and officer field experience.</p>\n<p>“The Fall FTX is really our recruiting event,” Stokes said. “The aim is not only to help train our cadets, but to offer a hands on experience to students who are interested in joining ROTC.”</p>\n<p><b><big>Move, Move Move!</big></b></p>\n<p>0600: The cadets arrive at the obstacle course, a 15-minute march from the barracks. The headlights from three cars light the course for the next hour, until the sun finally rises. The dew from the previous evening leaves the course wet and treacherous.</p>\n<p>First Class Sgt. Stephen Hall of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo says the course is monitored closely.</p>\n<p>“Most importantly, we don’t want anyone to get hurt,” Hall said.</p>\n<p>The course is just what you would expect from the Army, with an eerie similarity to the Bill Murray film “Stripes” with rope climbs, barbed wire, balance beams and walls to jump over that lead up to a huge ditch invisible in the dark.</p>\n<p>“Don’t forget to jump over the ditch,” Hall reminds the battalion. Spotters from each battalion are placed along each obstacle to ensure that no one gets hurt.</p>\n<p>The slow rise of the sun marks the end of morning exercises. The battalion marches back to the barracks for inspection and then to the mess hall for a hot breakfast.</p>\n<p><b><big>Paintball and Rappelling</big></b></p>\n<p>“They say that [the Army] does more before 9 a.m. than most people do all day,” Stokes says following the hectic morning. “This morning isn’t any different.”</p>\n<p>0900 hours: The morning’s events have led the cadets to the Gladiator Paintball Park on the other side of the post. The next five hours are spent playing paintball on the two large urban-style courses in the park in which teams of 20 cadets battle it out in a death match fashion.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year law and society major Nat Higgins leads the group, gathering up fellow cadets for a charge up the left flank. However, this paintball match is not like the ones on Fox Sports Network West, as soldiers take their time holding points and keeping cover. Every hit is done carefully and precisely, as if it were real.</p>\n<p>Higgins said the five-hour paintball session, besides being a good time, is helpful in both building camaraderie amongst the ROTC cadets and strengthening individual leadership and tactical skills.</p>\n<p>“Paintball really is all about teamwork,” Higgins said. “These exercises help us in working together, although of course it’s not like a real firefight.”</p>\n<p>Each soldier is completely covered in paint – one Cal Poly cadet has a welt the size of a golf ball on his neck from the second match. Not even the Daily Nexus photographer can avoid catching a few paintballs in the crossfire.</p>\n<p>1400 hours: The battalion makes it to Fort Merriam for some rappelling exercises. Here, cadets simulate a real life rappelling situation by rappelling down a rocky cliff face.</p>\n<p>Miles Tatum, a third-year history major and aspiring JAG for the U.S. Army, said he was glad to practice rappelling at the FTX.</p>\n<p>“Should we ever find ourselves overseas in this position, it’s good to have practiced it,” Tatum said. “This is all just one big learning experience.”</p>\n<p>Despite the long weekends and hefty amount of hours put into the ROTC, Tatum said that these exercises have become routine for him.</p>\n<p>“Military science and ROTC is now just an extra curricular activity, although it will soon be my life,” Tatum said. “I have still been able to have my college experience, going to DP on the weekends and having fun.”</p>\n<p><b><big>Chow</big></b></p>\n<p>When it is time for food on the post, it is almost certainly on the go, thanks to an Army invention known as the Meal Ready to Eat. The lightweight MRE is a completely portable meal soldiers use out in the field when they are without access to kitchen services. The 24 different meals in the MRE arsenal are given out at random, the favorites including Chili with Beans, Hamburger Beef Patty, Chicken Salsa and Tuna in Pouch.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had thousands of these,” Master Sgt. James Thorpe said, referring to the MREs as cadets take turns devouring 3,000-calorie meals between paintball matches.</p>\n<p>Each MRE comes complete with a flameless heater – a pouch that heats up contents placed inside it solely by adding water. A chemical reaction inside brings the small amount of water to boil.</p>\n<p>Second-year history major Chris Torrez said as long as the food has beef in the title, he is good to go.</p>\n<p>“My favorite is beef stew,” Torrez said. “But I mean, these are MREs; you have to learn to love them.</p>\n<p><b><big>The Cadre</big></b></p>\n<p>In 2005, several UCSB students and professors rallied against ROTC and attempted to ban the group’s presence from campus via a resolution sent to the Academic Senate. The protesters wanted to remove ROTC from campus because they disagreed with the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, which stipulates that its recruits are to keep their sexual orientation private.</p>\n<p>Although the resolution failed, Stokes, who is the new head military instructor for UCSB’s ROTC program, said he has vowed to create a new, positive attitude on campus about the ROTC. He said he plans on improving communication and publicity of the for the program.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I can really give to these students,” Stokes said. “I’ve given 18 years of my life to serve my country. I, too, started my military career in ROTC at [the University of] Nebraska-Lincoln, and I admire these students for the four years they are willing to put into [ROTC].”</p>\n<p>Thorpe, a soldier with more than 18 years of experience, keeps a watchful eye on the cadets from the sidelines.</p>\n<p>“I like to be stern with them, but I want them to work with me,” Thorpe said. “They need to know that I’m serious, but they [also] have to know you care.”</p>\n<p>Thorpe said he is a firm believer in leading by example. He still posts perfect scores of 300 on the Army’s physical fitness test, which includes running 2 miles in 10 minutes and 50 seconds.</p>\n<p>“If you can’t teach what you know, you ain’t nothing to the Army,” Thorpe said.</p>\n<p><b><big>To the Shooting Range</big></b></p>\n<p>0800 hours: “Fire when ready!” shouts Sgt. Jeremy Brown, among a team of ROTC cadets armed with M-16 A2s. The weapons resonate harmoniously as the cadets blow off round after round toward the target.</p>\n<p>It’s now Sunday, and the FTX has split into two different groups: Ranger Challenge and the rest of the FTX participants. After receiving breakfast, the Ranger Challenge team makes its way to the firing range as the remaining cadets stay back to clean the barracks.</p>\n<p>“If your weapon jams up, call for me,” Brown says, urging cadets not to make a dire mistake with their weapons. “Don’t try to fix it yourself.”</p>\n<p>Out on the range, both Thorpe and Brown are teaching skills for next week’s Ranger Challenge competition, an annual contest in which UCSB, UCLA, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and CSU Fresno compete in different disciplines.</p>\n<p>As the firing squad team members continue to work on their accuracy, zeroing the site on their weapons, second-year economics major Kevin Higuchi practices his aim for the Ranger Challenge Competition.</p>\n<p>“[Shooting] is really the epitome of the Army outdoor activities, as far as cadets go,” Higuchi said.</p>\n<p>Cadets fire in two-person groups, with the shooter alternating after firing a certain number of rounds. The pairs fire upon fixed targets marked by numbered lanes. Brown said breathing is the main cause of soldiers missing the target during practice.</p>\n<p>“When you breathe in, your entire body moves and that moves your gun,” Brown said. “You have to exhale before you shoot.”</p>\n<p><b><big>A Coalition of One</big></b></p>\n<p>Amid the political strife accompanying the U.S. Military Operation Iraqi Freedom, cadets in the ROTC who are graduating within the next few years are almost guaranteed to be stationed in the Middle East at some pont. Higgins said he does not expect everyone to support the mission in Iraq, but he said he urges them to support U.S. troops in general.</p>\n<p>“When people look at me and say that I’m a baby-killer, I just say that I’m just a guy trying to pay for college,” Higgins said. “The Army has its humanitarian side, too, and many jobs are outside of combat.”</p>\n<p>Higgins said he is aspiring to become a military police officer.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Stokes said the ROTC program at UCSB is a very helpful option for many college students</p>\n<p>“We offer scholarships to pay for either tuition or room and board,” Stokes said. “We also offer stipends for school fees, for example a $400 books stipend per year.”</p>\n<p>ROTC trains college students to become officers in the U.S. Army in fields ranging from infantry and artillery to medicine and engineering. Stokes said ROTC offers students the opportunity to improve their leadership capabilities and to make themselves more attractive in the job market.</p>\n<p>“These guys all know that they may end up in either Iraq or Afghanistan,” Stokes said. “If you can handle the stress of the Army, chances are you can handle the stress of a desk.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14870\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14870\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/","id":1789,"author":{"id":342,"name":"Benjamin Gottlieb"},"related":[1788,1787,1786],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I am a Rock, I am an Island...

The deputy told him that he himself was “a proud graduate of SBCC” and then asked the subject to repeat his ABC’s.</p>\n<p>The man did not seem to know the alphabet but happily repeated, “I’m from SBCC. I am a proud graduate.”</p>\n<p>He then told officers he lived at “R690” on “I.V.

Thankfully, it remained unbroken.</p>\n<p>The man’s lucky streak ended there, though, as the officer picked up and dumped out the tequila.</p>\n<p>The subject explained to the officer, “It’s okay for me to be drunk. I’m over 21.”</p>\n<p>Despite his age, the man was breaking two laws – possession of an open container of alcohol and obvious public intoxication – so the officer arrested him.</p>\n<p>While at the IVFP station waiting for transfer to jail, the man alternated between lying on the floor and sitting in the chair, apparently trying to find the most comfortable position.</p>\n<p>Soon the man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>I Would Walk 500 Miles… But Not with Her<br>\nThursday, Oct. 11, 12:40 a.m. – Officers standing on Camino del Sur observed a woman staggering northbound down the road, stumbling and walking into parked vehicles.</p>\n<p>An officer attempted to contact the 20-year-old woman, but she turned and ran away, but only for a brief moment. The fleeing fugitive managed to get less than half a block before the deputy detained her and placed her on the curb.</p>\n<p>During an intoxicating interrogation, the woman said she did not know where she lived and slurred out several incorrect addresses as she tried to identify her current location.</p>\n<p>While the woman said she had “nothing” to drink, she was uncooperative and combatant, and the deputy had to place her face down and cuff her.</p>\n<p>During the arrest, an unknown man, who was apparently a victim of the directionally challenged woman, thanked the officer for taking the loaded lady off his hands, saying, “We’ve been walking in circles for hours.”</p>\n<p>At the Isla Vista Foot Patrol station, an officer had to remove chairs from the booking room to keep her from climbing and stumbling over them.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Tourist Trap<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 13, 3:21 p.m. – A 20-year-old man was staggering around the 6500 block of DP, looking for Freebirds, when a deputy contacted him.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the man where he was going, to which the man replied, “I’m from San Diego, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>He then appeared as if he were about to topple over, so the deputy grabbed his arm to keep him on his feet.</p>\n<p>The man then told the officer that he had no friends in “I.P.” and had had eight beers that afternoon.</p>\n<p>For the man’s safety, he was arrested for public intoxication.
