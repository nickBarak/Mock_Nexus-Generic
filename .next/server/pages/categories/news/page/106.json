Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Residents will vote in November 2016 on whether to approve the formation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V., governed by a board of local representatives and funded by a Utility Users Tax. Tuesday’s meeting was the fourth in a series of 11 weekly meetings the Initiative organized for I.V. stakeholders to discuss the specific framework of the CSD.</p>\n<p>Attendees lauded the recent lighting improvements in I.V. and discussed areas that could use more lighting, such as local parks. There were also talk of adding sidewalks to both sides of Del Playa Drive and other streets with high amounts of pedestrian traffic.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Resource Recovery &amp; Waste Management deputy director Mark Schleich managed the expansion of lighting in I.V. and said new LED lights have replaced the old streetlights, boosting brightness and energy efficiency.</p>\n<p>County of Santa Barbara Public Works director Scott McGolpin said his department wants to add sidewalks to more areas in I.V. but there is a lack of funding.</p>\n<p>“The goal is to get continuous sidewalk throughout I.V.,” McGolpin said. “Partnerships make our projects successful.”</p>\n<p>Community Organizer from Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said under the proposed CSD, money for public works could be allocated for lighting parks around I.V., falling under the jurisdiction of the I.V. Recreation &amp; Parks Department.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Sherriff’s Office commander Sol Linver said the lack of lighting in I.V. parks causes safety issues at night.</p>\n<p>Transportation deputy director Chris Sneddon said the Department of Public Works consults with community members to figure out which areas need lighting most urgently.</p>\n<p>“We are always open to feedback,” Sneddon said.</p>\n<p>Responding to inquiries about solar lights, Sneddon said there are already solar-powered lights around Goleta by the bluffs, but they do not stay on throughout the entire evening and are not ideal for popular streets like Del Play Drive.</p>\n<p>Sneddon said his goal is to have continuous sidewalks on both sides of Del Play Drive and Sabado Tarde Road, the streets with the most pedestrian traffic and also to update existing sidewalks to comply with the American Disability Association standards.</p>\n<p>According to Sneddon, gas lines and water meters create obstacles and slow down the sidewalk installation process.</p>\n<p>“You should be seeing smaller pockets of work going on throughout the year,” Sneddon said. “There will be some bigger projects when we can do a whole block at once.”</p>\n<p>Sneddon also said Sueno Road, which is known for having cracks in the pavement, will be resurfaced this year.</p>\n<p>Attendees discussed graffiti abatement and how the county currently funds programs to remove graffiti in public spaces in I.V. According to District Representative for Supervisor Doreen Farr’s office Esther Aguilera, the county could partner with the CSD to fund future graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a matter of providing the funding and supplies,” Aguilera said. “We already have the infrastructure.”</p>\n<p>UCSB professor of art Kim Yasuda said the CSD could save money by preventing graffiti with projects like murals.</p>\n<p>“If you invest upfront, you can offset costs on the other end,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66424\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/i-v-community-discusses-lighting-graffiti-cleanup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66424\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/i-v-community-discusses-lighting-graffiti-cleanup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/i-v-community-discusses-lighting-graffiti-cleanup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/i-v-community-discusses-lighting-graffiti-cleanup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/i-v-community-discusses-lighting-graffiti-cleanup/","id":4597,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[4596,4595,4594],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bruce Porter to Run to  Succeed Supervisor Farr","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3487.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3487.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Fifteen-year Santa Ynez resident Bruce Porter announced Monday he will run to succeed Doreen Farr as Third District County Supervisor.

Porter declared his candidacy Monday due to encouragement from neighbors and community leaders according to a press release from his office. Porter is president of the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District School Board, Chairman of the Santa Ynez Valley Youth Coalition, a U.S. Army veteran and an Edward Jones financial advisor.</p>\n<p>According to Porter, 25 years in the Army and 15 years living in Santa Barbara County equip him with the necessary “tools” to improve the county.<br>\n“Why am I doing this? I think the biggest reason is I think I can make a difference,” Porter said.</p>\n<p>Porter said his role as an engineer for the Army required him to make judgments grounded in facts and reason rather than alignment with a belief system. According to Porter, this is the type of decision making that needs to take place in the Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p>“In the Army I was apolitical, which taught me how to think not based on ideology, but how to think on what are the facts and figures and how do you make reasoned common sense decisions about how to move forward,” Porter said. “I think that’s exactly the kind of approach we need to take in our county as opposed to just making a decision based on ideology.”<br>\nPorter said his campaign will consist of two parts: hearing potential constituents’ concerns and proposing solutions.</p>\n<p>“Listening to people is going to be the first step. Number two is analyzing what I hear from people and really laying out a new direction for the different communities of the county and laying out how the county can help,” Porter said. “I’m making that a big, big, big part of my campaign.”</p>\n<p>Porter said he walked around Isla Vista on Halloween with Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown and talked with residents about their concerns. According to Porter, the County has been neglecting I.V.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that Isla Vista hasn’t received the appropriate amount of attention from the county,” Porter said. “I think a lot of the unfortunate events over the past year have been a culmination of that benign neglect, if you will. At least that was the sense I was getting, especially from the students, when talking to them on Halloween night.”</p>\n<p>Porter said he plans on meeting with I.V. residents, business owners, students and campus groups to become more familiar with issues concerning I.V. and UC Santa Barbara during his campaign.</p>\n<p>“Clearly, a challenge for me is going to be UCSB and Isla Vista and understanding their issues, because they are so different from where I live in Santa Ynez,” Porter said. “I want to come down and be able to talk to the community leaders there.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the Third District has many types of constituent concerns and has more miles of California coastline than any other supervisorial district in the state. The District includes UCSB, the Los Padres National Forest, the Vandenberg Air Force Base and the Santa Ynez Valley Chumash population, with about 50 percent of its population residing outside city limits.</p>\n<p>Farr said these factors make Third District County Supervisor “more than a full-time job.”</p>\n<p>“We have a very large load of constituent issues that we’re working on throughout the district at any given point in time,” Farr said. “That probably makes the job of the Third District County Supervisor much more palpable and busy than probably any other district in our county.”</p>\n<p>Farr said the role of the Third District County Supervisor is especially important to I.V. residents because I.V. is an unincorporated area that cannot go to a city council and must rely strongly on its county representatives.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot going on and there’s a lot to learn and lot of decisions that the Board of Supervisors will impact on Isla Vista on a day-to-day and year-to-year basis,” Farr said. “The people in the community are going to require, or even demand, that their representative on the Board represent the interest there and advocate for them, as I have done.”</p>\n<p>Farr said Porter’s qualification for the office will become more apparent during the race.</p>\n<p>“It’s just the very beginning of the campaign, and as we move forward we’ll see how he responds to issues in the district and … where he is on various issues that are important to the Isla Vista community in particular,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, I.V. residents are going to want a candidate who supports Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the framework for the creation of a unique Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. funded by a Utilities User Tax (UUT).</p>\n<p>“I think that Isla Vista is going to be looking for a strong advocate of what the community wants, including AB 3,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said she hopes to learn candidates’ stances on issues such as AB 3, parking in I.V., the environment and I.V.’s Latino population.</p>\n<p>“I’d also like to learn more about their views on other social justice issues — things that I have taken very seriously in my role as EVPLA,” Dela Cruz said. “They are going to have a huge role in this because they are the voice of our community and they’re defending us at the county level.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she wants the future County Supervisor to have the same involvement with I.V. residents and UCSB students that Farr has had throughout her seven years in the office.</p>\n<p>“I would personally like to see this individual have the personal connection that Doreen Farr has had with us thus far in issues like AB 3 and other ongoing projects,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Downtown Business Association vice president Jay Freeman, Porter might struggle to win votes from I.V. residents due to his military background despite being a strong candidate.</p>\n<p>“Bruce Porter is clearly a very strong and experienced candidate, but I think he will have an uphill battle here in Isla Vista,” Freeman said. “His ex-military background is impressive, but may turn off student voters.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he advises students to follow the race closely because the support of the Board of Supervisors is crucial for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The large number of highly motivated student voters in Isla Vista should pay close attention to this election, particularly as we will likely see new entrants soon in this race,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of

through UC Santa Barbara’s campus on Thursday, joining more than 100 campuses nationwide in the Million Student March, a movement demanding free tuition, the elimination of student debt and a $15 minimum wage.</p>\n<p>The march was the largest protest on UCSB’s campus in recent memory and stoked the embers of other activist movements: many students wore black to show solidarity with University of Missouri protesters, sported Bernie Sanders pins or held up Black Lives Matter signs. Approximately a dozen organizers labored to direct the larger-than-expected crowd as they marched from Storke Tower to Cheadle Hall and back while documenting the march on social media. At one point, students began banging on the windows of Cheadle Hall, an administrative building, before organizers directed them back on the planned route.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz as being these places with strong activist spirits, but I think we proved today … that [UCSB is] every bit a part of that legacy of student activism.<br>\n<em>–A.S. vice president for statewide affairs Mohsin Mirza</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) student advocate general and fourth-year global studies and art double-major Joseline Garcia, who helped organize the event, said she was surprised by the turnout, but not the students’ passion.</p>\n<p>“Whether it was big or small, I expected [students] to be passionate, and I think it exceeded my own expectation,” Garcia said. “I think we made a moment today on this campus.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said the organizers wanted to send a message that people should have the right to graduate college without student debt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"601445665\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66452\"><img data-attachment-id=\"66436\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/sidebar-gallery/960x641-png-3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99-large/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?fit=960%2C641&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,641\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"960×641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright wp-image-66436\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_-250x167.jpeg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>“Our goal was to start a conversation regarding all these issues: free higher education, $15 minimum wage and no student loan debt,” Garcia said. “We have the right to be able to live and prosper and be happy, and we have a right to graduate without student loans and invest in our own future.”</p>\n<p>In a statement released Thursday afternoon, UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he supports students and sees the need for a “vital dialogue” on how to make public higher education accessible.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to send a strong message to our elected officials about the value of the University of California and the need to keep higher education accessible and affordable to all Californians,” Yang said in the statement.</p>\n<p>A.S. vice president for statewide affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Mohsin Mirza said organizers were nervous about how many people would attend the protest until hundreds of students arrived on the steps of Storke Tower at noon.</p>\n<p>“We were all nervous about how many students we could get to turn out to make this statement,” Mirza said. “It was all about making the loudest statement possible that we, as a generation, agree with these three demands.”</p>\n<p>Once a few hundred students gathered, organizers led the march across campus as administrators and students looked on. Protesters implored students to “walk out” of classes, and by the time the crowd reached Campbell Hall, more than a thousand students had joined the march.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66445\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"453475648\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66452\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66445\" data-attachment-id=\"66445\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/more-than-1000-march-for-free-tuition-living-wage/million-student-march-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447334061\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"75\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Million Student March-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66445\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66445\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Mirza, who helped organize the event, said the march showcases UCSB’s activist culture.</p>\n<p>“We talk about UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz as being these places with strong activist spirits, but I think we proved today … that [UCSB is] every bit a part of that legacy of student activism,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Education Ph.D. candidate Kathy Swift said the march was reminiscent of previous movements on other UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“There’s been some really big student protests at other campuses, and it seems to me like UCSB has been pretty small to negligible,” Swift said. “This is the first time I saw such a massive outpouring of protest from UCSB students concerning tuition and education.”</p>\n<p>Swift said she felt she was the “most senior” person in the march, and wished that more faculty members had attended.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s incumbent upon the professors and the adjuncts and the educators here to come show support with students,” Swift said. “If I’m going to really put my money where my mouth is and be a true educator and teacher, I have to support students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m carrying massive amounts of debt right now and, in fact, I get no support from my department.

One protester voiced her disappointment that activists did not occupy one of the buildings on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. assistant director of community affairs and fourth-year political science and history double-major Jared Daniels helped organize the march and said he could not rule out “occupy movements” in the future, but said Thursday’s march was about sending a message to administrators.</p>\n<p>“It’s like a poker game — you don’t want to throw all your cards and chips out on the table when you get a good hand,” Daniels said. “We have a really good hand right now. I think that there will be a time to occupy if [administrators] don’t take us seriously this time.”</p>\n<p>Co-chair of UCSB’s Black Student Union and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Jamelia Harris said it is the state of California’s responsibility to make sure all students can attend college.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66449\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"400980594\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66452\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66449\" data-attachment-id=\"66449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/more-than-1000-march-for-free-tuition-living-wage/million-student-march-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447336304\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Million Student March-12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66449\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12-1024x684.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“The failure of our state’s public higher education system to enhance accessibility and diversity initiatives — especially for black students — must be remedied by an increase in state funds and a decrease in classist, exorbitant tuition expenses,” Harris said. “The burden of improving our public higher education system should be on the state of California as opposed to us students and our families.”</p>\n<p>Graduate Student Association president Aaron Jones said students once could pursue public higher education without being burdened by debt.</p>\n<p>“The state, for whatever reason, has reneged on their commitment to higher education, while at the same time investing heavily in the prison industrial complex, and that’s a very stark example of the prioritization of the state,” Jones said. “What I observed here is the continuation of a movement to really put the public back as priority.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>To see not only so many people on our own campus but across campuses, so many people on Facebook liking, sharing, changing their profile pictures, news articles being posted about this, it’s absolutely amazing.

I’m in a position where I have to think about other people’s futures as well and determine how much I can invest in mine.”</p>\n<p>The march demonstrated a re-emergence of student mobilization that has historically driven fundamental change in society, according to Jones.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps the stark realities of being priced out of higher education or being saddled with five or six-figure debt is enough to motivate more people to say ‘this is not right’ and to do something about it,” Jones said.</p>\n<p><em>Assistant News Editor Juliet Bachtel and Reporter Olivia Pla contributed

for the MultiCultural Center’s open mic event Tuesday night, featuring Vietnamese-American spoken word artist MC Fong Tran.<br>\nTran focused on how to artistically express issues affecting students of color, encouraging people to participate and share their own stories. As the night continued, attendees shared their personal experiences from the stage via poetry, spoken word and rap.<br>\nTran said the open mic list was the most important thing making its way through the crowd.<br>\n“I know it’s one of the most intimidating things to get up on stage and share work in front of strangers that you never met before … but for me I hope these words are the purest form of liberation,” Tran said.<br>\nThird-year political science major Marquel Carnell said performing made him introspective.<br>\n“It made me think about love and freedom, oppression, my heritage,” Carnell said. “It made me think about a lot of things and that’s what’s so cool about these open mics.”<br>\nFourth-year global studies major Lannhu Khuat said the event was her first time in the Biko House and the crowd was very supportive of different backgrounds.<br>\n“It was just amazing to be a part of an environment that welcomed so much diversity,” Khuat said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66397\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1149883661\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66412\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66397\" data-attachment-id=\"66397\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/biko-house-hosts-open-mic-night-with-mc-fong-tran/expression_by-stephen-manga-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447141463\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Expression_by Stephen Manga-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-66397\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Third-year art history major Abraham Lizama said open mic events are places where people can share positivity, adding that he has been attending open mics for years.<br>\n“It’s powerful in the sense that when a person shared, you felt what they felt,” Lizama said. “You can see everything that they were saying and that’s why I love coming to these events because it’s an experience that you don’t get elsewhere.”<br>\nTran said educating people on issues affecting minority students is an important part of creating a welcoming environment.<br>\n“You have to be conscious about the issues happening in society and recognize them … such as racism and forms of oppression,” Tran said.<br>\nTran said it can be easier to sing or rap about societal issues rather than discussing them.<br>\n“There’s ways to be true to those struggles but at the same time celebrate and heal,” Tran said. “We had a packed house, we had a super diverse community that came on, the energy was high and I couldn’t imagine a better event … It was really impressive that people seek these spaces.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The victims reported they had their Apple laptops stolen on Halloween by an unknown suspect.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Nov. 4, officers responded to a report of a residential burglary on the 6600 block of Abrego Road. The victim reported her Apple laptop and backpack were stolen from her residence by an unknown suspect.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Nov. 5, officers received another report of stolen property on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The victims reported they had property stolen from their residence by an unknown suspect two days prior.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:45 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 6, officers responded to reports of a possible overdose on the 6600 block of Pasado Road. Upon arrival, units met with a male subject who appeared to be under the influence. Medical units arrived shortly after, but the subject refused to go to the hospital for evaluation. The subject was exhibiting erratic behavior and admitted to being under the influence of several “drugs.” He was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail without incident.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/wrap-up-nov-2-9/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/wrap-up-nov-2-9/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/wrap-up-nov-2-9/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/wrap-up-nov-2-9/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/wrap-up-nov-2-9/","id":3942,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3941,3940,3939],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

F&amp;B met in the State Street room of the UCen on campus to consider $16,851 in requests from campus clubs. The committee fully funded requests from the Mock Trial Team for $1,495, Cotillion Dance Club for $3,950 and La Escuelita for $900. A.S. F&amp;B also partially funded requests from three clubs, allocating $2,370 to the Swing and Ballroom Dance Club, $3,000 to the Women’s Soccer Club and $850 to the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA).</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the meeting, the committee operated with $19,500 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $6,665 in Senate Unallocated funds, $45,000 Student Initiated Outreach Program funds, $28,565 in Culture Weeks and Graduations funds, $26,480 for sports teams and $17,164 for academic teams.</p>\n<p>The Swing and Ballroom Dance Club requested $3,006 to host their “Swingin’ Hearts Swing Dance” event on Feb. 13, and was granted $2,370 by the committee and told to request funding for parking passes and photo booths from After Dark, a club that funds student-run, alcohol-free events.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year film and media studies major and Swing and Ballroom Dance Club representative Cecilia Gutierrez said the club provides a fun and educational experience for all skill-levels.</p>\n<p>“We are committed to providing social events for dancing. We encourage dancers from all backgrounds to participate and create a community,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Women’s Club Soccer requested $6,000 to fund travel and coaching expenses for nationals in Arizona, and was granted $3,000, the maximum funding amount allowed for sports clubs.</p>\n<p>The Mock Trial Team requested and was awarded $1,495 for travel expenses and registration fees for competitions in Arizona, Fresno and San Diego.</p>\n<p>Mock Trial member and third-year undeclared major James McFeely said members of the club compete in events that simulate courts of law.</p>\n<p>“We like to see Mock Trial as an academic sport,” McFeely said. “We’re asking for money to bring as many teams and as many people to as many tournaments we can so we can teach them the best we can.”</p>\n<p>CSSA was awarded $850 of their $1,500 request for hosting a Casino Night with live student performers.</p>\n<p>CSSA representative and second-year economics major Peilin Hu said the event allows audience members to enjoy free music and mingle.</p>\n<p>“The event aims to provide a relaxed music environment where like-minded people can perform and the audience can enjoy music,”

third-year political science major Cristina Hernandez said the event allows students and families in I.V. to enjoy the holiday together.</p>\n<p>“We prepare a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with turkey and mashed potatoes,” Hernandez said. “We hold this event because Isla Vista is very densely populated by college students and we often forget there are families in Isla Vista as well.”</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-66304\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Accessible, Attainable, Affordable Coalition UCSB (AAAC) will host #MillionStudentMarch Thursday beginning at Storke Tower to demand tuition-free public colleges, the cancellation of all student debt and a $15 minimum wage for all campus workers.</p>\n<p>The march, which will begin at noon, is part of a nationwide movement including all UC campuses and over 90 other colleges and universities. AAAC is organizing the event with the United States Student Association, the Associated Students (A.S.) Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), the A.S. Office of the Student Advocate and UCSB-4-Bernie.</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year mathematics major Kyle Butts said the UC Board of Regents treats the University as more of a corporate entity than an academic institution, beginning when Ronald Reagan became governor of California.</p>\n<p>“Reagan ushered in an era of neoliberal thinking in California while he was governor,” Butts said. “That coupled with 17 Regents being business men who serve 12 year terms and only one student Regent, it is pretty clear that the UC is a business now to them.”</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the march will partially address how the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education, which reaffirmed California’s prior commitment to the principle of tuition-free education, has been abandoned.</p>\n<p>“This is evident in when Governor Schwarzenegger and the UC Regents met in 2004 for the Compact for Higher Education,” Butts said. “There they made clear that students and donations would be the primary sources of funding instead of state funding.”</p>\n<p>Butts said tuition-free college is attainable.</p>\n<p>“If we decide that it is time for our school to return to a true public university, we can make it happen,” Butts said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference.<br>\n–<em> Josephine Ampaw</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Event organizer and third-year political science and feminist studies double major Josephine Ampaw said she hopes the Teach In AAAC hosted last week succeeded in educating students on tuition and debt and inspired attendees to affect change.</p>\n<p>“I hope this course of action will first off be taken seriously by our city, state and national leaders, who will execute a plan in order to make free higher education a reality after bringing the demands to the center stage,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Ampaw, accessible higher education is an investment in the future of the country.</p>\n<p>“I believe students have to fight for free tuition because education is a right, not a privilege,” Ampaw said. “Every person who lives in the state of California, in the United States and across the globe deserves the right to not only a elementary and secondary education, but to a higher education as well.”</p>\n<p>Ampaw said California has had tuition-free public higher education in the past.</p>\n<p>“Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the demand for a $15 minimum wage for all UC workers aims to facilitate the “American Dream.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole class of people who aren’t given the same opportunity as middle and upper middle-status people. With expensive public education and a $9 minimum wage, they as a collective are not able to overcome poor conditions with hard work,” Butts said. “Instead, the Million Student March is trying to level the playing field and create accessible forms of social mobility.”</p>\n<p>Butts said UCSB is a hub for student political engagement.</p>\n<p>“Looking at the history of UCSB and the UC system as a whole, I think we’re the heart of the student movement,” Butts said. “By hosting the march here at UCSB, we’re simply entering the long history we’ve had in activism.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Hannah Houska said the “the fight is now” against tuition hikes, because UC’s tuition freeze will end at the 2017-18 academic year.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is not to continue the cycle of tuition hike and tuition freeze, but rather our goal is to lower tuition,” Houska said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, #MillionStudentMarch will encourage students to be more politically active.</p>\n<p>“Come Thursday, it will be clear that frustration will bring students out,” Butts said. “It would be so easy to not come, but a million students across this country are going to have this issue be talked about, so activism is alive and well here at UCSB.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

id=\"caption-attachment-66238\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of First Congregational Church of Santa Barbara</p></div>\n<p>The First Congregational Church of Santa Barbara hosted the LGBTQ Youth Conference on Saturday at the church’s State Street location to provide engaging workshops for middle and high school-age LGBTQ youth and their families.</p>\n<p>The free conference, which ran from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., included a variety of workshops for both children and their parents. The parent workshops included a mental health forum led by two clinicians, a panel on LGBTQ youth health and a PFLAG, previously known as Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, discussion on how to be a supportive ally for LGBTQ youth. The youth workshops included a sexual education discussion, a college panel on identity expression and a series of “coming out” monologues. There was also a tutorial on “dragging” and a drag performance closed the conference.</p>\n<p>Reverend Alyssa De Wolf said attendees of all ages were able to benefit from the conference, particularly parents of LGBTQ youth.</p>\n<p>“I think the parents especially had a lot of time to meet other adults and other people who are working with LGBTQ students and I think got a lot of extra resources today too,” De Wolf said. “We’re trying to really strengthen not just the kids, but really strengthen the people who are working with kids so that we can be a better and stronger community.”</p>\n<p>De Wolf said she hopes the church’s future LGBTQ Youth Conferences will be longer and feature more speakers.</p>\n<p>“My vision is that it grows and grows,” De Wolf said. “I envision bringing in bigger speakers, more people, doing it maybe even more than one day, but really getting the word out and making it the sort of thing people come to every year and that kids especially get excited about every year.”</p>\n<p>Drag performer and 2012 Santa Barbara Queen of Pride Deja Re said she hoped kids left the conference feeling sure of their environment.</p>\n<p>“I think them having this safe place to go to and to really express themselves is great,” Re said. “It’s so great to see these kids at such a young age really know who they are and who they want to be.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Isabelle Tranner said she learned from people sharing their experiences of coming out to their friends and families.</p>\n<p>“I really liked sitting in on the ‘coming out’ panel,” Tranner said. “It was just people discussing their experiences coming out, and some of the issues and joys of coming out and that was really interesting to hear, especially from people younger than me.”</p>\n<p>Director of the Santa Barbara Transgender Advocacy Network Rachel Gloger said she hopes LGBTQ youth can feel physically and mentally safe and fully accept their identities.</p>\n<p>“The more safe spaces we can provide for these kids, the stronger their sense of community will be and the stronger their mental health outcomes are,” Gloger said. “I think the outcome of these events is just letting our town know that we have a lot of LGBT kids that we’re really proud of, and we’re proud to support them.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

at the MultiCultural Center theater Thursday night to educate students about tuition fees and student debt and to promote the upcoming “Million Student March.”</p>\n<p>AAAC collaborated with several other student organizations such as the Student Union, Office of the Student Advocate, Associated Students External Vice President of Student Affairs Office, UCSB-4-Bernie, A.S. Office of the President and UCSB University of California Student Association to inform attendees about issues surrounding the student march which will be held on Nov. 12 at 12:00 p.m. at Storke Plaza. UCSB will join over 90 other colleges, including all nine UC’s (excluding UC San Francisco), in marching to demand free public university tuition, the cancellation of all student debt and the installation of a $15 minimum wage for all campus workers.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and fourth-year sociology and Black studies double-major Mohsin Mirza said the Donahoe Higher Education Act, alternatively referred to as the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, made tuition free for UC schools when the UC system was first founded in the 60s. According to Mirza, the act was in place up until Ronald Reagan imposed a “student fee” to attend the universities and diverted UC funding to other, less productive activities.</p>\n<p>“[Reagan] saw the UCs as promoting — basically handing out free education to a whole bunch of would-be communists,” Mirza said. “He saw the UC’s principles to educate people as dangerous, and this tied into his ideas, which were generally against public spending.”</p>\n<p>I.G.N.I.T.E. Coordinator for the EVPSA office and fourth-year biology major Clare Idehen said Reagan diverted UC funding to prison spending and mass incarceration, which “disproportionally” affects Blacks and Latinos more than other ethnicities in America with one in three black men going to prison in their lifetime.</p>\n<p>“Since the 80s, we’ve seen a huge 800 percent increase in the amount of people going to prison, and almost half of all the people incarcerated in prisons right now are for non-violent drug charges,” Idehen said. “Why are our prisons full of people who are non-violent?”</p>\n<p>According to Idehen, there are better ways to use the 80 billion dollars spent per year on mass incarceration in America.</p>\n<p>“With 80 billion dollars, we could provide preschool for every three-and-four-year-old in America, finance roads, bridges and airport jobs,” Idehen said. “And most importantly, allocate tuition at every public university and college.”<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Idehen said students around the globe are fighting for accessible education for all.</p>\n<p>“They’re fighting for the same thing we are,” Idehen said. “They’re not very different from us — they’re maybe 17 and 18, 19, maybe 16 years old going to college. They’re basically us. So it’s really great to stand in solidarity with these students, and I think it’s really important to know what’s happening.”</p>\n<p>UCSB United States Student Association Board of Directors Co-Chair and second-year political science major José Javier Magaña Mendoza said independent Vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders advocates for government subsidized college tuition through a Robin Hood Tax. According to Mendoza, it is an estate tax on stock and bond sales and a sales tax on commodities, debentures, derivatives and notes which will bring in an estimated 300 to 350 billion dollar in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>“How the tax works is that it’s just a small financial transaction tax on Wall Street, a tax that is 0.5 percent on stocks, 0.1 percent on bonds and 0.00 percent on derivatives,” Mendoza said. “This helps us because it will go to things such as jobs, housing, affordability, child care, healthcare, transportation and a big investment on the infrastructure. As students, it also goes to our higher education.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA officer, Teach In event organizer and second-year mathematics major Kyle Butts said internal UC worker union AFSCME 3299 supports the Million Student March because the union cares about students and agrees with the $15 minimum wage demand for all UC workers.</p>\n<p>“All nine UC’s, except UCSF, are holding marches, and AFSCME 3299 covers all those different areas, so they’re going to be having a voice in this, but mainly stand in solidarity,” Butts said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, there has been a push for Chancellor Yang and the Vice Chancellors to attend the Million Student March.</p>\n<p>“All the A.S. Executives, the GSA president and the RHA president all signed letters requesting Chancellor Yang and all of the Vice Chancellors’ presence at this march,” Butts said. “We believe that this isn’t just a student issue or a worker’s issue, but this also has to do with UC as a whole.”</p>\n<p>Teach In speaker and third-year sociology major Alex Villegas said access to education is a global issue, and protests have been happening in London and Africa, with Africa’s protest breaking out into violence.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think a lot of people are really aware that our generation is facing this on a global level, and that we’re going to be impacted,” Villegas said. “It’s not just a temporary situation, but it’s something life-long.  It’s going to impact the future generations, and at the end of the day we’re going to end up inheriting all of this. Our leaders are setting us up for failure, so if we don’t take action now, we’re essentially all screwed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Casey Ramirez said he attended because he is struggling to afford tuition.</p>\n<p>“Debt is hard, and paying for things are a hardship,” Ramirez said. “It’s causing issues with my parents — we’re middle class and they have bad credit, so it’s hard to get loans.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said it will take a change in policy to ease the “deep debt” students in America are accumulating.</p>\n<p>“The money exists. We have enough money, we’re the richest country in the world to pay for free higher education,” Mirza said. “We all know all too well the impact the cost college can have on our families. The question is how can we make it so that this isn’t the case, so we can have the principle of free higher education.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

California’s postdoctoral scholars voted overwhelmingly to ratify a one-year agreement with the University between Oct. 19 and 27, ending long and sometimes tense negotiations between the UC postdoc union (UAW 5810) and the UC.</p>\n<p>The agreement, which instates yearly raises, increases health care coverage and loosens restrictions on international postdocs, was ratified by 98.8 percent of postdocs in a count of 3,471 to 42. Negotiations came down to the last hour on Oct. 1, with postdocs threatening to strike. After having to extend the previous contract to Oct. 9, the two sides reached a new one-year contract which the union ultimately ratified Oct. 27.</p>\n<p>The union, which represents more than 6,000 postdocs at all UC campuses, charged the University with “bad faith bargaining” and “refusing to provide the Union with information” necessary for negotiations in a document submitted Sept. 18 to California’s Public Employment Relations Board.</p>\n<p>Although the union never actually went on strike, president of the postdoc union Anke Schennink said she believes the threat of a strike led to concessions from UC negotiators who were “definitely aware” of the strike.</p>\n<p>“[The strike] was not mentioned at the bargaining table itself, but it came up in conversations in the hallway,” Schennink said. “We were willing to go on strike, and we were willing to prepare for that if the University hadn’t made any moves towards us.”</p>\n<p>Director of the UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program Mark Lawson said the agreement is an “accomplishment” for both sides.</p>\n<p>“I think it is important to look at the big picture and be happy that the UC and the postdoc representation are able to come to an agreement,” Lawson said in an email.</p>\n<p>The previous deal had run for three years, and Schennink said the new one-year contract means the union is already preparing for next year’s negotiations.</p>\n<p>“We have already started making plans and are already working on our strategy for next year,” Schennink said. “There is really no plan to relax.”</p>\n<p>The one-year time frame also allows the University and the union to get right to work on issues where there is common ground, according to Schennink.</p>\n<p>“We made some improvements and they are important, but there are also some other improvements that both sides wanted to see, definitely in terms of gender equity and childcare reimbursements,” Schennink said. “With a one-year contract, more post-docs will have more opportunity to participate and express their views and say what’s important.”</p>\n<p>Schennink said female postdocs face additional difficulties, referring to a UC Berkeley professor who was accused of kissing and groping female students against their will.</p>\n<p>“As a postdoc, you are in a lot of ways dependent on your professor,” Schennink said. “A professor in your postdoc can make or break your career.”</p>\n<p>In October, Schennink said members of the negotiating team “don’t respect postdocs.” When asked if that is still the case, she said the new contract would not immediately change that feeling.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that changes in a month or in a couple of months,” Schennink said. “I think this takes years, given how lengthy the process was for bargaining … and how ridiculous and absurd the University’s comments were.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara unit chair for the union and postdoctoral fellow in UCSB’s materials department Patrick Callahan said he voted for the deal and expected it to pass.</p>\n<p>“I did expect [the vote] to be about as overwhelming as it was,” Callahan said. “We didn’t really lose anything so I’m not really surprised.”</p>\n<p>Callahan said while other postdocs would benefit from the contract, his job would not change much, if at all.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we were really fighting for was protections for international postdocs, but I’m not an international postdoc so that doesn’t really affect me,” Callahan said. “I don’t expect things to change for me, but for other people I’m sure it will make some difference.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

de-stigmatize alcohol and drug addictions and educate UCSB and SBCC students about resources for recovery.</p>\n<p>The conference will host keynote speakers American Buddhist teacher and personal wellness believer Noah Levine, President and CEO of Young People in Recovery Justin Luke Riley and UC Riverside collegiate recovery program advisor Audrey Pusey. Each speaker will present an individual topic about the struggles and successes relating to recovery. Sponsors will offer resources and information to students, with organizers anticipating attendees from across the UC and out of state.</p>\n<p>UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program counselor and recovery specialist Angie Bryan said the conference can help break down preconceptions about the recovery process while creating a community for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“One goal is to bring students together in recovery just for fellowship and mutual support,” Bryan said. “We’re trying to promote awareness about being in recovery, and that people in recovery are assets to a college community … to reduce the stigma about being in recovery in college.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the recovery movement began at UCSB four years ago with the assistance of UC Riverside and has grown into a UC-wide program for addiction recovery.</p>\n<p>“I think initially the goal was to help start the movement in California,” Bryan said. “Four years ago, we were just starting our program here and Riverside had a student group, but there wasn’t else much happening in our state. Now we have collegiate recovery programs at most of the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Adam Daar said UC Riverside supports UCSB in hosting the event.</p>\n<p>“UC Riverside wanted to keep it student led, and I think that people liked the idea of bringing it to Santa Barbara because they saw that we had a strong collegiate recovery program community already,” Daar said. “We are really happy to be able to do this.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year global studies major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Emily Bills, recovery programs have been growing rapidly in recent years and UCSB has one of the best programs to host the conference.</p>\n<p>“There are only so many recovery programs in California that are able to host. We have a huge support from the Alcohol and Drug Program that no other schools really have,” Bills said.</p>\n<p>According to Director of UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program Jackie Kurta, the process of recovery will be destigmatized throughout the conference. Kurta said she hopes this will lead to more acknowledgement and support for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“I think there are assumptions made about how college students lead their lives,” Kurta said. “There’s stigma about people being in recovery or students who were struggling and not yet able to make a choice that is working well for them. I think our community needs to be more sensitive to being helpful and supportive and not being judging and off-putting in that way.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said the conference will also showcase UCSB’s efforts to improve the lives of students dealing with addiction and recovery.</p>\n<p>“We all saw it as a terrific opportunity to bring attention to the work that is being done and to applaud the efforts of the program and to bring some recognition to our campus, because people don’t always think of UCSB and sober living,” Kurta said. “It was an opportunity to say we have a thriving program, we have a very diverse community and our community can include students in recovery.”</p>\n<p>Daar said he hopes the conference can help unify colleges and create diverse alcohol and drug programs at different universities.</p>\n<p>“I think something the conference can do is [help] other schools with their recovery program and learn about our own and cultivate a space of learning … and expand the national recovery movement, especially on college campuses,” Daar said.</p>\n<p>Daar said all students and UCSB staff are welcome to attend the conference and can volunteer for the event to learn about recovery.</p>\n<p>“They can reach out to us and sign up for volunteer shifts,” Daar said. “They get free admission and are welcome to help out and attend the entire conference — they get all the information that is really guided for students.”</p>\n<p>Daar said if students are struggling with an addiction they should seek help and know that recovery teams are there for support.</p>\n<p>“Try really hard to not be afraid to ask for help. Know that no one in this recovery community is going to judge you for asking for help,” Daar said. “They can come to us to ask for help and they will be welcomed with open arms. I want them to know that.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the resources offered at the conference can be of help to anyone affected by addiction.</p>\n<p>“I just want to emphasize that everybody is touched by addiction in some way, whether it’s personally or [through] a friend or family member,” Bryan said. “I think that anyone could get something out of the conference.”</p>\n<p>The Alcohol and Drug Program offers weekly meetings open to all community members and hosts quarterly events. Services are primarily free to all students, including resources for being an ally in recovery.</p>\n<p>For more information about the conference and registration, visit

Lingerie,” describing the post-9/11 lives of six Pakistani-American Muslim women Friday at 8 p.m. at the MCC Theater.</p>\n<p>Fatima’s play intertwines sex, politics and religion as the six women discuss their lives during a heavily Islamophobic time in America while drying their lingerie. The play aims to dispel stereotypes of Muslim culture and women.</p>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the event represents ideals the MCC aims to promote.</p>\n<p>“This play was really hot — up and coming,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It fit within the narrative and algorithm that the MCC uses, that intersection of diversity, relativity and being current.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said the purpose of the show is to educate UCSB students about the often negatively portrayed culture of Pakistani women.</p>\n<p>“There is such a heightened sense of Islamophobia and aggression towards anyone in proximity to that faith in this country that I think anything that you can utilize to cut down at that kind of aggression is beneficial,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “I think that a play like this might hit the mark for some in breaking down those barriers, and perhaps not for others.”</p>\n<p>Muslim Student Association (MSA) member and third-year CCS literature major Heeba Kaleem said because Fatima is Muslim, her performance will offer an accurate perspective on what it is like to be stereotyped.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just someone who doesn’t know anything about Muslim culture or may have stereotypical understandings of what being a Muslim in America is like, so I’m happy there’s some kind of story being told,” Kaleem said.</p>\n<p>MSA member and third-year economics and math major Nihal Hakim said he thought the title of the play is offensive to Pakistani people.</p>\n<p>“At first when I saw the event name, “Dirty Paki Lingerie,” my first hang up was on just the name, or the use of the word Paki,” Hakim said. “Paki is a racial slur, especially in the UK, but also to a certain degree in the U.S. It’s a word that really brings down a whole community of people.”</p>\n<p>Hakim said the image on flyers for the event of Fatima holding piece of lingerie while wearing a hijab is a false image of what it is like to be a Pakistani woman.</p>\n<p>“It relies on the stereotypes of the Muslim woman — the Pakistani woman — being somewhat different and that difference being an oppression and that oppression can only be alleviated by a very specific type of post-colonial westernization,” Hakim said.</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said she encourages people to watch the show with an open mind despite the backlash from students and alumni.</p>\n<p>“I would encourage them to think twice and come to the event to think about what the ultimate goals of the play really are,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It’s not necessarily perpetuation; she’s not trying to participate in stereotyping ourselves or themselves or yourselves, she’s trying to combat them.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Pardall Center to provide the community with food and information on local resources.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Resource Fair is a public event which will feature several different organizations, including Committee of Student Well Being (COSWB), I.V. Food Co-Op, Department of Public Worms, Health and Wellness and Environment Affairs Board. The organizations will offer information about their resources, answer questions and host free food giveaways.</p>\n<p>IVCRC publicity manager and third-year global studies major Lauren Lim said the Resource Fair will bring people together in I.V., which is the goal of IVCRC.</p>\n<p>“As IVCRC, our goal and intention for having this committee to begin with is to bring this community together — bring everyone together — and I think the Resource Fair is a great way [to do so],” Lim said. “Not just for UCSB students to know what resources are available for them, but because it’s in I.V., we can have families come, and different people around the community come.”</p>\n<p>Lim said the event will inform attendees of the resources available to them provided by multiple I.V. and UCSB organizations.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of people don’t know what’s available to them, and to have this [event] and present it to them in one day, in one space …” Lim said. “I’m excited for it to become a really big part of what we do as a community.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC external chair and third-year art and sociology double-major Aimee Hanna said she is looking forward to the event and what it can offer to the community.</p>\n<p>“This event is about feeding people, letting people know all about the resources that are available to them and allowing for these things to become accessible,” Hanna said. “It’s for folks to really come together and realize how we can all come together to make a better community.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC secretary and third-year psychology major Tai Kang said A.S. Food Bank Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen inspired the decision to host the I.V. Resource Fair.</p>\n<p>“When Aimee and I first got our positions in IVCRC, we were really interested in food security,” Kang said. “I suggested it to Aimee because I read a bunch of articles on food security, so we went to the Food Bank, where we met Tuyen, and she was the one who gave us the idea for the Resource Fair.”</p>\n<p>According to Kang, Nguyen asked IVCRC to take on the project because A.S. Food Bank lacked the time and resources.</p>\n<p>“We have all the student lock-ins and the fees to do so, and it’d be a great resource to the students,” Kang said. “I think that big thanks has to [go to] Tuyen because she was truly the one who inspired us to do this.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said the I.V. Resource Fair has been in the works for some time, though it has been unsuccessful until now.</p>\n<p>“It was something that some of our previous leadership wanted to do last year, and we started to do a couple resource fairs with some community folks to begin to look at and model,” Nguyen said. “Something that already exists in the community, such as the Healthy Food pantry provided by the Isla Vista Youth Projects.”</p>\n<p>According to Nguyen, A.S. Food Bank met with IVCRC over the summer, during which the committee chose to pick up the project.</p>\n<p>“We’re super thankful to them to put forth their resources and attention,” Nguyen said. “They are amazing and they’re actually the lead; we’re here to actually just be a partner in their particular project.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said A.S. Food Bank will provide food at the I.V. Resource Fair.</p>\n<p>“Our role would be to help support and provide pantry items,” Nguyen said. “We have a variety of produce that folks can sift through, but this is a way in which we can provide a different access.”</p>\n<p>Second-year environmental science major Colleen McCamy said she is looking forward to the event.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a really cool event,” McCamy said. “[It’s] helpful for students to explore the different resources here in the community and on campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66171\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66171\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/","id":4624,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[4623,4622,4621],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":106,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
