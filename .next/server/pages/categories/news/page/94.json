Graduate students hope it will protect them from “abusing power.” <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) is proposing a revised graduate student Bill of Rights for the first time since 1995 to protect graduate students from abuse and exploitation.</p>\n<p>The GSA passed the newly drafted Bill of Rights in its General Assembly meeting on April 5. Representatives submitted the draft to the Academic Senate on Monday and hope to present before the Senate’s Graduate Council soon.</p>\n<p>The Bill of Rights currently in action at UCSB was drafted and ratified in 1995. The University of California Student Association (UCSA) drafted a system-wide graduate student Bill of Rights in 2011 and UCSB’s GSA informally approved it soon after.</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of Student Affairs Kathy Swift initiated the revised Bill of Rights in December and said she expanded upon UCSA’s 2011 Bill to make the new Bill. The 2011 Bill is about 20 pages long, and the recently passed draft is about 21 pages long.</p>\n<p>“I just basically beefed it up and expanded a couple parts that I thought were needing more support, more explanation,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>Swift said the new bill adds language allowing for the creation of a graduate student advocate position and a shared governance board. Her vision is that the graduate student advocate would be someone students could rely on to “negotiate through the bureaucracy” and resolve disputes.</p>\n<p>The shared governance board, Swift said, would be a group of student representatives, including the graduate student advocate, with voting power in the Academic Senate. Swift said members of the Academic Senate might be skeptical of allowing a shared governance board.</p>\n<p>“That’s a real touchy one,” Swift said. “That’s where we’re going to get into some negotiation.”</p>\n<p>According to Swift, the need for a revised Bill of Rights comes from the “touchy and more sensitive relationship” between graduate students and the university. She said academic departments typically consider graduate students as low‐level associates rather than colleagues.</p>\n<p>“We encounter situations where we’re exploited or we’re taken advantage of or we’re not respected,” Swift said. “That can really be destructive for our academic careers.”</p>\n<p>Timothy Irvine, GSA vice president of committees, helped Swift draft the bill and said advisers have strong influence over a graduate student’s professional life through letters of recommendation, networking and aid in publishing.</p>\n<p>Graduate students are “basically working under a group of like three to six people who have control over all of those things,” Irvine said. “So, if they decide to abuse their power, your ability to respond to that is extremely limited.”</p>\n<p>Irvine said the university currently has a process in place by which graduate students can respond to abuse, but he said these efforts are “akin to Band‐Aids on bullet holes.”</p>\n<p>“There is a method for adjudication, but it doesn’t necessarily work that well, and it doesn’t necessarily give people justice,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Yanira Rivas Pineda, the GSA external vice president, said having a graduate student Bill of Rights is necessary to help graduate students who are in dysfunctional relationships with their advisors.</p>\n<p>“As graduate students, we sacrifice our financial stability and basically put our life on hold for a few years,” Pineda said in an email. “The last thing we need is to have to navigate conflicts on our own with little to no support or guidance.”</p>\n<p>Swift said the 1995 Bill of Rights in action across the university, drafted in 1995, offers basic protections to graduate students, but is incomplete.</p>\n<p>“It is not comprehensive,” Swift said. “It doesn’t cover a lot of areas that graduate students need.”</p>\n<p>Swift said she needs to consult with the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division, otherwise the newly revised graduate student Bill of Rights will not be enforced.</p>\n<p>“[Graduate students] don’t have that much in the way of enforcement power at all, which is why it’s necessary for us to try to negotiate this with the Graduate Division and the Academic Senate,” Swift said. “They’re the ones that will make the enforcement.”</p>\n<p>Swift said representatives of the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division have already begun to express skepticism toward the new draft in her meetings with them.</p>\n<p>“This is going to cause problems,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 14,

including a $15 minimum wage for all campus workers and free tuition at public colleges and universities.</p>\n<p>This year’s march will respond directly to controversial <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/controversial-trump-markings-surface-around-campus/\" target=\"_blank\">chalk writings</a> on campus in the last two weeks that have shown support for Donald

crowd, and march participants will write positive messages on chalk walls,” the organizers said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The group had three demands in their November 2015 march at UCSB, which attracted more than 1,000 students. These demands were tuition-free public college and universities, cancellation of all student debt and a $15 per hour minimum wage for campus workers.</p>\n<p>This year, the group is also demanding divestment from private prisons.

id=\"caption-attachment-69841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Isla Vista, pictured here during Deltopia 2014, is in the middle of a historic push toward self-governance.</p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista, currently an unincorporated area, is leaping toward self-governance in a historic push that could give residents a say in how the area is run.</p>\n<p>The effort toward self-governance is confusing, however, and this confusion is compounded by an alphabet soup of acronyms: CSD, UUT and MAC, to name a few.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud and Cameron Schunk co-authored the Isla Vista Plan of Service, which is a tentative plan for how the area would be run if the measures are passed by Isla Vista voters in November.</p>\n<p>Residents have been pushing for self-governance for nearly 50 years, as Abboud outlined in a <em>Nexus </em>op-ed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/history-in-the-making-isla-vista/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier in April</a>. To get students and I.V. residents up to speed, the<em> Nexus</em> spoke with Abboud and Schunk and asked them some of the most pressing questions about I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>You can click on a question below or scroll through the full guide.</p>\n<p><strong>1. <a id=\"top\" href=\"#1\">What is a community service district and how is it different than a city?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>2. <a href=\"#2\">What are I.V. residents voting on in November?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>3. <a href=\"#3\">Who will be in charge of the CSD?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>4. <a href=\"#4\">What powers will the CSD have?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>5. <a href=\"#5\">How will the CSD pay for these services?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>6. <a href=\"#6\">What is AB 3?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>7. <a href=\"#7\">Why can’t the county provide these services with the county tax?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>8. <a href=\"#8\">How will the CSD change the average Isla Vistan’s day-to-day life?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>9. <a href=\"#9\">Is the I.V. Plan of Service final?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>10. <a href=\"#10\">Where can I get more information?</a></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong id=\"1\" style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">1. What is a community service district and how is it different than a city?</strong></h2>\n<p>Arguably the most important difference between a community service district (CSD) and a city is that cities can make laws while CSDs cannot.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, co-author of the I.V. Plan, said the size of I.V. and the fact that many residents spend their money outside of the area are also factors.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to afford a city with the tax base I.V. has,” Abboud said. “Our sales tax revenues in I.V. are very low. We really only have Pardall [businesses], and a lot of people spend their money in downtown Santa Barbara and Goleta. It’s hard to have a city because we don’t have a tax base for it.”</p>\n<p>Both cities and CSDs are required to do certain things, but cities have more responsibilities. For example, a city is required by law to provide police and jail services.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, co-author of the I.V. Plan and a field representative for Assemblymember Das Williams, said that Goleta spends half of its annual budget on policing. While Goleta residents are generally more comfortable with law enforcement, Schunk said, I.V. residents may be less willing to spend a substantial amount of money on policing.</p>\n<p>“We could never, ever, ever provide police services at all, and even though we have that authority, we’re not required to do it,” Schunk said. “The city has a lot of things that it not only has the authority to do, but the requirement to do.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"2\">2. What are I.V. residents voting on in November?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Nov. 8, Isla Vistans will vote on three measures. The first two measures require a simple majority, while the third measure requires a two-thirds majority.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A vote on whether or not to establish an Isla Vista CSD.</li>\n<li>A vote selecting five of the directors who will govern the district (see <a href=\"#3\">question 3</a>).</li>\n<li>A vote on whether or not to establish an 8 percent utility users tax (see <a href=\"#4\">question 4</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If passed, all three measures would go into effect on March 1, 2017.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"3\">3. Who will be in charge of the CSD?</strong></h2>\n<p>Seven directors will govern the CSD. When I.V. residents vote in November on whether or not to establish the CSD, they will also elect five members to sit on a new Board of Directors. In addition, one director will be appointed by the county and one director will be appointed by UCSB.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69844\" style=\"width: 245px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69844\" data-attachment-id=\"69844\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/10-questions-about-isla-vista-self-governance/jonathan-abboud_by-spencer-brandt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jonathan Abboud_by Spencer Brandt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69844\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=235%2C156\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"235\" height=\"156\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jonathan Abboud, co-author of the I.V. Plan. <em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“The directors are responsible for everything the CSD does,” Abboud said. “They are responsible for making sure it’s fiscally responsible. They’re the ones who vote on policy and make sure the policy is implemented.”</p>\n<p>These directors would also hire a general manager to oversee the day-to-day activities that keep the district running.</p>\n<p>Four of the five elected directors and both appointed directors would have four-year terms. The other elected director would have a two-year term. There are no term limits for the directors, which Schunk said could work to the Board’s advantage.</p>\n<p>“We are very interested in having long-term representation on that board,” Schunk said. “That is helpful for a lot of districts because if there is a question of how they did something 40 years ago, there’s a guy who can answer that.”</p>\n<p>Candidates for the Board will have to register to run by Aug. 8.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"4\">4. What powers will the CSD have?</strong></h2>\n<p>The I.V. Plan outlines eight powers the CSD is prioritizing:</p>\n<p><strong>• Municipal Advisory Council (MAC):</strong> The MAC would be purely advisory, giving input to the Board of Directors based on feedback from I.V. residents. It is possible that the MAC would include directors from the Board.</p>\n<p><strong>• Area Planning Commission (APC):</strong> The APC would essentially be a zoning board that would “oversee all new development proposals that are submitted within the Isla Vista area,” according to the I.V. Plan.</p>\n<p><strong>• Graffiti abatement:</strong> The I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District is currently in charge of washing away graffiti, but the I.V. Plan says finding funding for this program is a “constant struggle.” The Plan proposes a $10,000 annual budget to keep graffiti abatement up and running.</p>\n<p><strong>• Parking district</strong>: The I.V. Plan proposes funding comprehensive parking studies that will allow the Board of Directors, with the survey data, to establish a parking district specific to I.V.’s needs.</p>\n<p><strong>• Landlord-tenant mediation services:</strong> UCSB students currently have access to tenant mediation services through the UCSB Community Housing Office, but the I.V. Plan proposes a contract between the CSD and the Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program specifically aimed toward non-UCSB students in I.V., half of which are Hispanic families, according to the Plan.</p>\n<p><strong>• Community policing:</strong> The I.V. Plan proposes a “cadet program” run through I.V. Foot Patrol, employing five cadets that would work part-time, especially during weekend nights when UCSB is in session.</p>\n<p><strong>• Gutter, street tree and sidewalk infrastructure improvement: </strong>A proposed $5,000 would go toward “enhancements to public space” such as trees next to streets, art on sidewalks and benches, according to the I.V. Plan.</p>\n<p><strong>• Maintenance and management of community facilities: </strong>The I.V. Plan proposes hiring a half-time grant writer whose job would be ascertaining funding for the I.V. Community Center at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"5\">5. How will the CSD pay for these services?</strong></h2>\n<p>The simple answer is federal grants, UCSB funding and a tax on I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>When Isla Vistans vote in November, they will vote on whether to enact a utility users tax (UUT), which will tax I.V. residents’ electricity, water, gas and trash services at a rate of 8 percent. If passed, the tax would go into effect on March 1, 2017, when the CSD is officially established.</p>\n<p>Schunk said that, as of now, almost everybody’s services would be taxed equally at 8 percent, although there would be exemptions for low-income residents and families and potentially a difference between residential and commercial properties.</p>\n<p>“My hope is that the Board of Directors do a series of public engagement workshops,” Schunk said, “where they meet with stakeholders from the business community, students, community members and say, ‘Here is your expected burden; is that acceptable? Yes or no.’”</p>\n<p>UCSB has pledged an annual $200,000 to the CSD for seven years, and backers of the CSD also hope to get additional money by applying for federal grants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"6\">6. What is AB 3?</strong></h2>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3, authored by Assemblymember Das Williams and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown on Oct. 7, 2015, gives I.V. the power to do things that no other CSD is allowed to do if it is passed by voters. These services include running a parking district, establishing a tenant mediation program and creating the Area Planning Commission.</p>\n<p>“No other CSD in the entire state of California has ever been able to provide a tenant mediation program. No CSD has ever been able to provide code enforcement,” Schunk said. “When we talk about how unique AB 3 and the CSD is, it goes deeper …  There are so many things here that no other district has.”</p>\n<p>Abboud and Schunk emphasized that, because the I.V. CSD would be the first of its kind to implement several programs, it is vital that passionate people serve on the Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>“There is no precedent for how a CSD runs a tenant mediation program, which is why it’s really important [that the Board includes] people who are critical thinkers who are really looking at the big picture,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"7\">7. Why can’t the county provide these services with the county tax?</strong></h2>\n<p>Backers of the proposed CSD say it provides an advantage over county services because the services would be developed specifically for I.V., and the UUT would generate funds that are dedicated to services in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The way the county operates, the service they provide you in Isla Vista has to be the exact same service as in the unincorporated Los Olivos area,” Schunk said, adding that the CSD would create more “localized” services.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69846\" style=\"width: 240px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69846\" data-attachment-id=\"69846\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/10-questions-about-isla-vista-self-governance/lafco-spencerbrandt-5-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO/Cameron Schunk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69846\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?resize=230%2C154\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"230\" height=\"154\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-5-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cameron Schunk, co-author of the I.V. Plan. <em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“People in the City of Santa Barbara chose to form a city and tax themselves for services,” Schunk said. “A similar thing is happening here in Isla Vista. You’re seeing residents saying we want these services this way and we’ll pay for them.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said that, currently, in order for I.V. to get funding for various projects, it needs the support of supervisors who have no attachment to the area.</p>\n<p>“To get funding from the county for things, you need four supervisors to vote in your favor,” Abboud said. “[Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr can be the best supervisor anyone’s been, but if the other supervisors, or even two supervisors, don’t want the funding to go to I.V. for a small service, it won’t happen.”</p>\n<p>“The best thing I.V. voters can do is vote for our supervisor,” Abboud said. “We can’t influence what the other districts are doing.”</p>\n<p>The CSD would change that and give Isla Vistans representatives who would serve the area directly, according to Abboud and Schunk.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"8\">8. How will the CSD change the average Isla Vistan’s day-to-day life?</strong></h2>\n<p>Schunk and Abboud said that, for the first time, I.V. residents would have people close by who represent their interests and are focused solely on I.V.’s needs.</p>\n<p>“You would have someone to talk to and listen to you whose full-time responsibility is I.V.,” Abboud said. “For a supervisor, I.V. is just a part of what they do.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he often wishes he could direct people to the kind of services that would be provided if the CSD is approved.</p>\n<p>“I hear people complain about stuff, but they have no idea who to talk to about it or how to get it fixed or who is even responsible for that problem in the first place,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"9\">9. Is the I.V. Plan of Service final?</strong></h2>\n<p>Abboud said the Plan is “just a concept” and that residents should request the services they want to see in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If you implemented the Plan word for word, it would work, but it doesn’t have to be a reality,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Schunk added that the plan is subject to change and is not “set in stone.”</p>\n<p>“I want people to feel empowered to go and advocate for the services that they feel most strongly about when the CSD is formed,” Schunk said. “None of those budget items are set in stone.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"10\">10.

classes to immerse themselves in creative alternatives.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind the hiatus is Laurel Beckman, professor of art, who says the event is intended to create a “communal

Alaia/Paipo surfboard making, silk scarf dyeing and a trip to the Getty Center Museum in L.A. are among the activities planned this week to replace the regular humdrum of university life.</p>\n<p>Beckman said the idea for the interlude came together quickly because of cooperation from faculty and students. Students are “agents of their own interests,” Beckman said, explaining that they will be leading several of the week’s activities.</p>\n<p>“One of the really important parts of the interlude is that everybody’s participating: students, staff, faculty, grad students, undergrads, everybody,” Beckman said. “Other than classes and working by yourself in the studio, we don’t have a lot of community activities, and I wanted to do [an interlude] so people could choose … what they participated in.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69768\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69768\" data-attachment-id=\"69768\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-arts-department-takes-interlude-to-build-community-expand-creativity/arts-building-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Arts Building\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69768\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69768\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Kip Fulbeck, professor of art, said recently that students had not been producing with the same “drive and fervor” that he is used to, and the arts faculty had also become complacent.</p>\n<p>“We were becoming stagnant and needed to shake things up,” Fulbeck said in an email. “I’m hoping to re-ignite our creative drives, excitement, passion for making art and experiencing life. You learn more outside the classroom than in it.”</p>\n<p>Graduate students found out about the interlude late last quarter and were highly encouraged to direct activities or to create ideas for alternative classes.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Rose Briccetti, who has organized a butterfly pinning event, said the interlude will be an interesting outlet for creativity.</p>\n<p>“[The interlude] seemed like a fun kind of unique way to get people thinking about art outside the confines of just painting or printmaking or sculpture or the materials and ways of making we kind of generally adhere to,” Briccetti said.</p>\n<p>According to graduate student Emily Baker, the arts department is lacking a critical element of preparation for a career in arts: a tight-knit community. Baker said she pushes students to go to art events every quarter so they can talk about their work and have contacts to “bounce ideas off of.”</p>\n<p>“As an artist, networking is my work. It’s my job, you know? Like the whole ‘wine and cheese’ art event thing, that’s work,” Baker said. “And I did feel that lack of community in the arts department … so I think this will help perpetuate that community a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>Students and professors alike are unsure at the moment whether they will carry the interlude into the future, but at least a few, like Briccetti, are very interested in seeing it continue as a department tradition. Taking a risk is difficult in huge institutions, Briccetti said, commenting that university rules and protocols can limit activities that are “strange and different and out of the box.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t think you can have innovation, or you know, society can’t move forward if people aren’t willing to just try something new,” Briccetti said. “So I hope that this — regardless of how it all shakes out — is something that will inspire other departments and our department to shake things up, to try new things, to not get stuck in old ways of doing things.”</p><div

According to Pineda, UC Berkeley’s GSA drafted and passed a resolution in favor of GrADE and other UC graduate students hope to pass similar resolutions.</p>\n<p>“The campaign … addressed problems with the lack of faculty diversity (in all forms), finding adequate mentorship and faculty with research projects that reflect the 21st century graduate population,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>Iman Sylvain, UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly Vice President of External Affairs, said she helped write a resolution that endorses the full and permanent participation of graduate students in faculty hiring processes with equal rights to interview and provide input as faculty.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem.” — Timothy Irvine</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The UC acknowledges that it lags behind peer institutions in hiring women and underrepresented minorities,” Pineda said in an email. “We believe that having the next generation of faculty (those of us being trained to become professors) being part of the hiring process is [a] small but necessary step in democratizing the hiring process and our university.”</p>\n<p>According to Timothy Irvine, GSA’s Vice President of Committees and Planning and graduate student, a small percentage of tenured or tenured-track faculty are African American. He said having younger, more diverse people involved in hiring committees would play an important role in increasing diversity.</p>\n<p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem,” Irvine said. “Hiring committees are a big part of the solution to that problem.”</p>\n<p>Irvine also said having graduate students who are being taught by faculty on these committees would be a “very logical next step towards shared governance” between students and universities.</p>\n<p>Irvine said UCSB’s current system is “decentralized” and graduate student voices are heard differently in each department’s hiring process.</p>\n<p>“That is done in the name of academic freedom, but what you also get is like a patchwork of adherence to different conduct codes and legal codes,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Some GSA members expressed concern about the change creating too much pressure for graduate students who find themselves in disagreement with department faculty. Others questioned whether graduate students should have voting powers.</p>\n<p>“I believe that these concerns are precisely why we need to include graduate students in the hiring process,” Pineda said in an email. “Those of us who are going to stay in the academy should be able to experience the hiring process from the other side and not just when we’re out in the job market.”</p>\n<p>GSA members are in the process of modifying their initial draft, and will bring the resolution to a vote during a General Assembly Meeting on May 3.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this story misquoted Timothy Irvine as saying “Human Rights Act” instead of “Civil Rights Act.” The article has been updated accordingly. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/","id":2504,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2503,2502,2501],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bassem Eid: Divestment Movement Hurts Palestine","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LMB_2190.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LMB_2190.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB students and Goleta residents gathered Thursday evening in the MCC to hear a human rights activist discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a path toward peace and the divestment movement.

At UCSB, campus security was present, but the event proceeded without incident. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kayla Shenassa, a second-year classics major, organized Eid’s lecture without the aid of any student organization by contacting the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), the agency overseeing his tour, after noticing Eid was speaking at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p> If I will boycott Israel tomorrow morning, how can I survive? Will BDS find me a job? Will BDS feed my children?” — Baseem Eid</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important for our community and students on either side, or on no side, of this issue to hear the truth, and Bassem is one of the biggest sources of truth on this issue because of his background as a Palestinian human rights activist,” Shenassa said. “The reality is that BDS is not conducive to peace whether it’s on campus or in the Middle East.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to denouncing BDS, Eid spoke on topics ranging from his arrest by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 1996 to the corruption of Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eid maintains that the only solution to the plight of Palestinians must be one that improves the economic standing of his people. He said over 92,000 Palestinian workers currently hold Israeli work permits and enter Israel to work for the companies BDS seeks to divest from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He pointed at the closure of a SodaStream factory that BDS successfully forced to move out of the West Bank as a disaster for 1,500 Palestinian workers who lost jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Palestinians living in the West Bank are not worried about settlements,” Eid said. “They are worried about having a job and how they will feed their families.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the plight of Gaza, Eid said he places most of the responsibility on Hamas, the ruling government there, which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization and Eid calls a “dictatorship.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“To SJP, my message is one message: The only ones who will succeed to bring justice to the Palestinians will be the Palestinians themselves.” — Baseem Eid</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want BDS to come to the leaders of Hamas by asking why the leadership imposed three wars on the Gaza strip,” Eid said. “I think the survival of the Gazan people is the responsibility of the Hamas organization.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eid gave individual messages for SJP members and BDS advocates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To SJP, my message is one message: The only ones who will succeed to bring justice to the Palestinians will be the Palestinians themselves,” Eid said. “To the BDS, I have to say you are killing our economy. You are destroying our economy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP representatives who attended the lecture declined to comment.</span></p>\n<p>When asked what BDS supporters can do to help the Palestinian people, Eid suggested investing rather than divesting.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the BDS will succeed to persuade Palestinian billionaires who are living abroad to invest in Gaza and the West Bank, I will look at that as a huge help,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goleta resident Andriana Goodell said she came to learn from someone with “relevant experience” of the conflict.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw it advertised in my community center and thought it was interesting that Eid lived for 33 years in Shuafat,” Goodell said. “I learned good information from a person with relevant experience toward the Palestinian and Israeli conflict.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eidan Shalom, a third-year psychology major, served in the Israeli Defense Forces from 2011 to 2013 and is the president and founder of Students Supporting Israel at UCSB. Although he disagreed with Eid’s call to open up Israel’s borders, he agreed with Eid’s views on BDS.</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Palestinians need economic prosperity,” Shalom said. “When BDS thinks they are targeting Israel, in reality they are targeting Israeli businesses, which actually employ thousands of Palestinians.”</span></p>\n<p><em>[Correction: In an earlier version of this article, Mahmoud Abbas was referenced as the President of the State of Palestine.

Marjorie Luke Theatre on gun violence in America and what can be done to address the “profit-driven crisis” causing mass shootings, domestic violence, suicide and accidents across America.</span></p>\n<p>The panel discussion, which followed a screening of the film “Making a Killing: Guns, Greed, and the NRA,” included the film’s director, Robert Greenwald; State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson; Assemblymember Das Williams; Mayor Helene Schneider; Toni Wellen, chairwoman of the SB Coalition Against Gun Violence; and Bob Weiss, father of UCSB student Veronica Weiss who was killed in the Isla Vista mass murder in May 2014. The film, which brought many members of the audience to tears, was released on March 15 by Brave New Films and has since been screened at over 500 schools, churches and meeting centers across the country, according to Greenwald.</p>\n<p>Greenwald said he hopes the film will contribute to a change in culture similar to what was seen in years past with the use of cigarettes or the need for seatbelts in cars.</p>\n<p>“Nobody thought we could beat the cigarette companies, nobody thought we would beat the automobile companies when they tried to convince us you don’t need safety belts,” Greenwald said. “One day, we will look back with the same belief and awareness that we stopped and changed the culture of guns.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said the notion that anybody can own a gun needs to be revisited.</p>\n<p>“We need to take another look at what the Second Amendment says. It says ‘a well regulated militia’ being necessary to the security of a free state and the right of the individual to bear arms shall not be infringed,” Jackson said. “It will be up to states like California … to stay one step ahead of this issue and try and get a renewal of the definition of the Second Amendment that is more rational, logical and takes on the NRA.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLQ9B-p5Q-YOP8cqdpXcO_yrWTY8ZAB4eq&amp;hl=en_US\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked by an audience member what he believes might have prevented the shooting in Isla Vista, Weiss said he had done a lot of thinking about that question and studied all the information he could find.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A few of the facts really stand out,” he said. “One is that law enforcement was aware of this killer and had several contacts with him over the course of the preceding year. The parents of the killer called the sheriff’s office and asked for a wellness check, which was done. It took about 15 minutes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weiss said the wellness check completed by the sheriff’s office was “poorly done.”</span></p>\n<p>“They never asked the killer if he had a gun, they never walked out to their squad car to run his name to see if he had a gun. That information could have been very valuable. When their therapist and their parents are calling the sheriff’s office and the sheriff’s office does a 15-minute cursory review and walks away, I don’t know what to add to that. It was a massive failure.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the ability of one-third of the legislature to block any form of taxation prevents those working to prevent gun violence from coming up with new solutions.</p>\n<p>“One-third of the legislature blocks all forms of taxation, including ones that could make us safer, including ones that could provide revenue that is otherwise unavailable to make basic improvements in either our data basing, our investigations, our law enforcement,” Williams said. “I can tell you that most of our communities do not have adequate funding for law enforcement, and a tax on ammunition to fund that sort of investigation is a great idea and one that I would support.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69669\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69669\" data-attachment-id=\"69669\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/activists-address-gun-violence-as-profit-driven-crisis/bravenewfilms-moviepanel-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BraveNewFilms Movie+Panel\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69669\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69669\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Sen. Jackson added that there is “no political will” in California to pass legislation that would limit firearms.</p>\n<p>“We can’t get a two-thirds vote on almost any tax, and, frankly, there is not a single Republican vote I can think of in the legislature that would support any implementation of any limitations on firearms and certainly not imposing a tax.” Jackson said. “That’s double negative for the Republican party, a tax and then doing anything to challenge the gun lobby.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she was proud to co-author Assembly Bill 1014 (AB 1014) with Williams, legislation that would allow firearms to be temporarily removed from individuals who are at risk of committing acts of violence.</p>\n<p>“The measure would allow family members, when they know that their loved ones are in distress, to be able to contact the police to get restraining orders that would remove any access to firearms that they might have,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, the effectiveness of AB 1014 depends on databases which deal with the registration of guns and prohibited persons: people who are under restraining orders, have mental illness issues or have committed crimes for which they are prohibited from owning a firearms.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of the problem is that we do not have the resources for these databases,” Jackson said. “The ability to get those databases up and running effectively has been significantly limited over the course of the years, and we need to reinvest in those things so that the police have greater confidence when they go to do a wellness check, when they go to check if someone is a prohibited person, that those databases are complete, they’re accurate and they’re up to date.”</span></p>\n<p>Wellen said Santa Barbarans cannot forget that there has been more than one mass shooting in the area in recent years, recalling a woman who killed six people at the post office in Goleta in 2006.</p>\n<p>“That woman was found to be mentally unstable, and she was under involuntary hold and unable to purchase a gun in California, but she went to New Mexico where no questions were asked and she came back here and she killed six people,” Wellen said. “We must always remember that we have had more than one mass shooting in our community, so we are all touched by gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Greenwald said that while he admires the Santa Barbara legislators for having the “brains and guts and the mindset” to work toward a solution, it will take more than just strong legislation to stop gun violence.</p>\n<p>“We must look at it for what it is, it’s a public health crisis and the way public health crises are solved and fixed and handled are from a multiple of ways,” Greenwald said. “Laws are there, you need a variety of laws, there are many different situations, and fundamentally, fundamentally we have to say these are weapons that kill, and they should not be so easily available to everyone.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We must always remember that we have had more than one mass shooting in our community, so we are all touched by gun violence.” – Toni Wellen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mayor Schneider said gun violence in the U.S. has become so common that Americans are “desensitized” to it.</p>\n<p>“We are the only country in the world really who has this kind of senseless kind of gun violence—you don’t see this in other countries,” Schneider said. “There were 330 [mass shootings] in 2015. I mean, there were 35 days in that year that didn’t have a mass shooting. That’s it. We turn on the radio or you watch the news and you hear about something that happened somewhere in the country and it was just another one, it feels like.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said it is critically important, when discussing the issue of guns in America, to address the culture of violence in society today.</p>\n<p>“If you take a look at the games that our kids are playing, it is absolutely horrifying,” Jackson said. “The problem is that young people today are playing these violent games, the movies are so graphic, so violent; the more people you can kill, the better.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, if children are not taught to understand the effects of gun violence on a personal level, the number of deaths resulting from firearms in America will not change.</p>\n<p>“We are not teaching our young people enough about compassion and empathy so that they recognize that if, in fact, someone were to die, it would devastate. If it were they that lost a sibling or a parent, what that would mean to them,” Jackson said. “In the world we live in today with the proliferation of firearms, if we don’t teach children and others what the consequences are of having those firearms, of considering or using them, we will continue to see 30,000 people a year killed by gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the NRA does not have more resources than those working for limitations on firearms.</p>\n<p>“Their hardcore numbers are actually pretty small, but they mobilize on the issue, they vote on the issue, they give pro-gun politicians money, they make phone calls,” Williams said. “The majority of people are with us on these issues, but there have been no consequences on it, because those who are on our side on this do not mobilize on the issue.”</p>\n<p>Greenwald said his hope for the film is that, over time, people will understand gun violence as a public health crisis driven by profit and greed and that they will take action.</p>\n<p>“[The film] is not about the second amendment; you may have noticed we never mentioned it in the film,” Greenwald said. “Give people a different way to talk about something, and from that it becomes action, and from that it becomes change, and from that we have great elected officials that carry the call and make it happen.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We are the only country in the world really who has this kind of senseless kind of gun violence; you don’t see this in other countries.” – Helene Schneider</p></blockquote>\n<p>Williams said it was difficult, as a parent, to watch the individuals in the film speak about the loss of their children.</p>\n<p>“To have them be willing to retraumatize themselves in the interest of having other people fall victim to guns … I think we should give Bob, and I think all the parents in the film, some thanks, because it takes a lot of courage and love to do that,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Although Weiss is driven by a desire to prevent others from losing their loved ones, like many other people affected by gun violence, his main motivation is to honor his daughter’s life.</p>\n<p>“She gave her life up for this movement.

class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“The acts of vandalism and hate speech … were deeply disturbing and not only violated the rule of our campus but violated the core of our university,” Yang said. “Any actions that undermine our sense of community are unacceptable, unwelcome and will not to be tolerated.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Brandon Morse, fourth-year political science major, said he thought the town hall was “productive,” and that there should be a follow-up meeting that allows students to express themselves through poetry or speeches.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“I absolutely think that town hall meetings are the correct response — we need dialogue on campus,” Morse said. “It may be able to help, now that we have a general idea, to bring it down to the individual level.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As of Saturday, 175 current and former faculty members had signed an online <a

publicly condemn the defacing of our campus in the strongest terms possible.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“The perpetrators must know that they are condemned, isolated and marginalized by the university as an institution from the highest level,” the petition reads. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Morse called this part of the petition “unfortunate.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“It’s a sad irony in the fact that [faculty] are creating a marginalized and isolated community, and as opposed to reaching out to them … they were treating the people in the same manner that they were trying to protect the community from,” Morse said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69712\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption

A second “Million Student March” is planned for Thursday and organizers have chosen a theme of “reclaiming” UCSB from the anonymous chalk writers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The event description encourages students to join the march “in an effort to RECLAIM our campus after heinous, racist chalk statements targeted at many marginalized communities at UCSB.” The group says it

criticized the University of California in an Assembly oversight hearing Wednesday, with one lawmaker saying he was “pissed” when he saw the state auditor’s claim that the UC had relaxed its standards in admitting nonresident students.</p>\n<p>The state auditor published a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AUDIT.pdf\" rel=\"\">report</a> in March that found the UC “has undermined its commitment to resident students” by admitting more nonresidents. According to the study, the university enrolled 82 percent more nonresidents from 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 while decreasing enrollment for resident students by about one percent in that same period.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the audit claims that the UC lowered its standards for nonresidents by admitting thousands of out-of-state students with lower grade-point averages, S.A.T. and A.C.T. scores than those of resident students.</p>\n<p>Assembly members called the hearing to examine if the University’s admissions and finance policies disadvantaged California residents applying to the UC in recent years. According to committee chair and District 52 Assemblymember Freddie Rodriguez, the UC’s policies have failed to put Californians first.</p>\n<p>“Sadly, we are here today with an audit report that confirms what many of us have speculated,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>District 64 Assemblymember Mike Gipson, who requested the audit in 2015, said he was “pissed” by the state auditor’s findings that the UC displaced resident students by increasing the number of non-resident students.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a slap in the face, not only of the members of the legislature, but also of the taxpayers of the state of California,” Gipson said. “The University has just done a very poor job.”</p>\n<p>UC Associate Vice President of Undergraduate Admissions Stephen Handel insisted, however, that the report is “incomplete” and that the University admits every eligible resident student.</p>\n<p>“The University makes an explicit guarantee to every family in California whose son or daughter applies to UC that we will find a place for them if they meet UC’s eligibility requirements,” Handel said. “It is a guarantee that we never extend to nonresidents.”</p>\n<p>UCSB <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/campus.profiles.2015.16.pdf\" rel=\"\">enrolled</a> 6,014 students in 2015, of those, 86 percent were California residents, seven percent were out-of-state and seven percent were international.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_yhhis0kzk8JIuVxN\" title=\"UCSB Nonresident Enrollment Gradually Increased from 2013 to 2015.\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?xTC\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am/yhhis0kzk8JIuVxN\" target=\"_blank\">UCSB Nonresident Enrollment Gradually Increased from 2013 to 2015.</a><br>\n <a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create pie charts</a></div>\n<p>The state audit report specifies UCSB among four other campuses that increased its nonresident target faster than the resident target. Nearly 20 percent of UCSB’s expenditures are funded by the state, and the freshman enrollment targets for the 2015-2016 year aimed for approximately 3,850 California students and 550 nonresidents.</p>\n<p>The different enrollment targets were created to fill each state-funded seat with a California student, according to Lisa Przekop, UCSB Director of Admissions.<br>\n “Non-residents never replace a seat funded by the state,” Przekop said in an email.</p>\n<p>The report also includes GPA breakdowns between resident and nonresident students for every school in the UC. UCSB displayed lower average GPAs for nonresident students between 2010-2011 and 2014-2015.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_Q08MW6ql9XhDCnQ3\" title=\"UCSB showed significant shifts in admitted resident and nonresident GPAs between 2009-10 and 2010-11.\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?cIO\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am/Q08MW6ql9XhDCnQ3\" target=\"_blank\">UCSB showed significant shifts in admitted resident and nonresident GPAs between 2009-10 and 2010-11.</a><br>\n<a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/bar-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=bar_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create bar charts</a></div>\n<p>According to Przekop, the “slight” differences in GPA can be attributed to inconsistencies in the ways different schools calculate GPAs across the world.<br>\nIn the Assembly hearing Wednesday, Handel said the GPA, S.A.T. and A.C.T. scores of the students admitted to the University do not completely qualify an eligible student.</p>\n<p>“Reader evaluations are based on a set of 14 academic factors that look well beyond traditional numeric markers of achievement,” Handel said. “A grade-point average and a test score, important as they are, provide only partial insight into the qualifications of students for college.”</p>\n<p>UC Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom further asserted that the state budget is what controls the enrollment of resident students, not the enrollment of nonresidents.</p>\n<p>“Growth in nonresident students does not constrain the Univeristy’s ability to enroll growing numbers of California resident students,” Brostrom said. “The key to enrollment is state funding.”</p>\n<p>District 16 Assemblymember Catharine Baker told the UC representatives at the meeting that they need to stop discounting the audit report as “unfounded” and start working with the legislators on a solution.</p>\n<p>“It’s very easy for all of us to come after you with pitchforks, and trust me, I’ve got one and constituents of mine have one,” Baker said. “Part of the solution is that you are not tone deaf. One of the worst things that can happen with a public servant is they get tone deaf. That’s what we’re hearing.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 7 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

radio station that is presenting Goodman’s talk and book signing. Goodman’s book, <em>Democracy Now!: Twenty Years Covering the Movements Changing America</em>, written with contributors David Goodman and Denis Moynihan, will be released on April 12.</p>\n<p>“One of our first stops is Santa Barbara and a fundraiser for KCSB,” Goodman said in a phone interview Tuesday. “I’ll be talking about independent media in a time of war and elections and how important it is to have the media, when we cover war, that’s not brought to you by these weapons manufacturers.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said her new book explores “the idea that it’s movements that make history,” rather than individual politicians.</p>\n<p>“Instead of hearing the same small circle of pundits, who know so little about so much, explaining the world to us and getting it so wrong, you hear people [on “Democracy Now!”] at the grassroots, closest to the story, telling their own stories,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>When the show began, “Democracy Now!” was broadcast on nine community radio stations. Twenty years later, the program is broadcast on more than 1,400 television and radio stations internationally.</p>\n<p>Goodman said she wanted to make college campuses a major part of her 100-city tour because universities and student activism are central to her show’s purpose.</p>\n<p>“We have a young, diverse audience and there’s so much happening on college campuses around the country, so it’s a critical part of what we do,” Goodman said, mentioning the Black Lives Matter movements last year at the University of Missouri, Ithaca College and more. “It is astounding how students’ voices are a key part of these movements.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/controversial-trump-markings-surface-around-campus/\" target=\"_blank\">recent chalk markings around UCSB</a> supporting Donald Trump and disparaging immigrants and Muslims, Goodman called the slogans “extremely insulting.”</p>\n<p>“What Donald Trump has done is really open Pandora’s box with his hate-filled rhetoric; his islamophobic, sexist, racist language; his outright encouraging violence at his rallies,” Goodman said, adding that the students’ reaction was vital to maintaining a welcoming environment.</p>\n<p>“I think students’ reaction—banding together and saying they won’t tolerate hate on campus—is a very important one and it’s a part of a whole coalescing of student activism,” Goodman said. “I think there’s a lot of energy on campus and a lot of commitment to making change, and that’s critical to the functioning of the democratic society.”</p>\n<p>The Daily Nexus is named after a quotation attributed to educator Robert Maynard Hutchins: “A free press is the nexus of any democracy.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said Hutchins’ words are “absolutely” as true today as they were in 1970 when the <em>Nexus</em> was renamed.</p>\n<p>“I think independent media is the oxygen of a democracy, whether on campuses or off campuses,” Goodman said. “There is a reason why our profession — journalism — is the only one explicitly protected by the U.S. Constitution, because we’re supposed to be the check and balance.”</p>\n<p>Goodman will be speaking at Corwin Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday. The event is free for students and $10 for non-students.

With the new space, Metzger said, they will be able to check into a physical office.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69621\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69621\" data-attachment-id=\"69621\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucpd-to-create-new-office-in-library/police-substation_by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Police Substation_by Jenny Luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69621 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Police Substation_by Jenny Luo-1\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69621\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCPD officers will not work in the substation on a regular schedule, but will be able to stop by and write reports, conduct interviews or store their radios and other equipment. It also allows UCPD to extend their reach across campus.</p>\n<p>“This is just one substation they have as part of that broader goal to break down those barriers in the communities they serve,” Metzger said.</p>\n<p>Olson said the office will also allow the department to extend its reach to the east area of campus. Much of UCPD’s focus is dedicated to the center of campus and the west side, which borders Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The substation “definitely extends ourselves to that east campus because we don’t have a large presence unless we’re mobile, driving in that area,” Olson said, adding that the new office is “a place where we can literally hang our hat.”</p>\n<p>Heather Vest, fourth-year biology major who was walking out of the library Monday afternoon, said she had mixed feelings about the new substation.<br>\n“I’ve been here late at night and I’ve seen CSOs walking around, but it’s not like a lot of security really,” Vest said. “I feel pretty secure in the library — everything’s closed at night and there’s only one door open — but maybe other people don’t.”</p>\n<p>While Vest said she thought the new substation was a “cool” idea, she said seeing police on campus makes her think someone has committed a crime.</p>\n<p>“I feel like in the past I’ve seen UCPD on campus and it kind of makes people feel uncomfortable,” Vest said. “If someone’s driving around in a UCPD car, I know that something’s going on on campus or something’s wrong.”</p>\n<p>That view is one that Olson hopes will change with the new station. He said officers should be “accessible to the community, a visible presence” and that the new substation will help officers interact casually with students.</p>\n<p>Nicholas O’Dea, first-year physics major, was studying on a bench outside of the library on Monday. He said “knowing that [the new substation] is there makes me feel a bit more comfortable, knowing that there’s a CSO presence.”</p>\n<p>O’Dea said he understood that others might not want UCPD officers to continually patrol the library, but that the office itself adds a level of security.</p>\n<p>“I might feel a little uncomfortable if they had been patrolling around the library, something of that nature,” O’Dea said. “But that fact that there’s a room there, I don’t feel uncomfortable with that. If something happens in the library, I know I can turn to them.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 3 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

“The Divided States of America” was featured at the 2012 Democratic National Convention and will be on display at both the 2016 Democratic and Republican National Conventions.</p>\n<p>Chor Boogie, artist of “The Divided States of America,” said the series opened his mind to a “whole different perspective” of politics.</p>\n<p>“Divided states of America, we’re supposed to be the United States Of

I love my country, I love this country, I love other countries too, I love the world,“ Boogie said.</p>\n<p>According to Boogie, the series aims to uplift everyone, including those who are affluent and don’t experience many societal issues present today.<br>\n“I don’t see them tearing down, I see them lifting up and being uplifting,“Boogie said. “If somebody wants to take them that personal, that’s their personal prerogative. That’s my whole point of this entire series: solutions.”</p>\n<p>Boogie said he wants his art to provide viewers with new perspectives to prevalent issues.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69586\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69586\" data-attachment-id=\"69586\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/print-night-4-5-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bipartisan Art 4-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-69586\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69586\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“Of course, yeah, it opens up hearts, minds, bodies and souls to a whole new perspective that they either didn’t care about, or they do care about and they’re just so engulfed in the one way versus the 100 million other ways that are out there,” Boogie said. “Critical thinking, that’s all I ask for.”</p>\n<p>Boogie said the installment was in part a collaboration between him and Nirmal Mulye, the commissioner of the paintings.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, he gives some input but he puts in a good 20 percent vs. my 80 percent.

There’s so much diversity and different perspectives. If we can just create certain solutions that mold with that diversity, we should be good, ya know? Nothing’s gonna be perfect. Let’s just use some critical thinking with a little bit of precaution. Let’s be discerning.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, April 7 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

graduated in the last 15 years.</p>\n<p>To access the large, digitally active portion of UCSB’s alumni, the university is hosting “UCSB Give Day,” its first 24-hour online donation drive on Friday, to increase donor participation in student organizations, financial aid, scholarships and faculty research.</p>\n<p>“Give Day is a 24-hour event using social media channels to digitally connect to our UCSB communities,” said Beverly Colgate, associate vice-chancellor. “It is also a concentrated outreach to our campus’ massive base of young alumni.”</p>\n<p>According to Colgate, the university has raised “matching gifts” from donors to have their dollars match another donor’s area of passion, making fundraising more “personal.” If a donor contributes at a specific time, their donation can be matched with a campus organization of their choice.</p>\n<p>“Our giving website will post the time intervals when these matching gifts are available for matching,” Colgate said. “A couple of our Gaucho celebrities gave matching gifts, too.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The inaugural effort is perhaps less about that single day as it is about what [Friday] will usher in: a whole new era of fundraising at UCSB,” — Beverly Colgate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>UCSB First will also be tabling in front of the library on Friday to discuss the significance of philanthropy on campus. The organization will hand out T-shirts and offer photo opportunities for students to learn about the social media campaign.</p>\n<p>John Lofthus, UCSB Alumni Association associate director, said 60,000 students have graduated in the last ten years, and he hopes the young generation of alumni will digitally connect with the university, improving a nation-wide decline in percentage of alumni giving.</p>\n<p>“Young alumni are proven to be very philanthropic, but they’re wanting to invest through their philanthropy for causes they really believe in,” Lofthus said. “For us, because having alumni support is critical, it’s trying to think about how can we do a better job of connecting with our alumni. And this is one of those ways we’re hoping to do that.”</p>\n<p>An alumni group in London will be <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ucsb-gauchos-at-the-gaucho-tower-bridge-tickets-24303781264\" target=\"_blank\">hosting</a> their own Give Day at The Gaucho restaurant, showing how the event is reaching alumni “far and near,” Lofthus said.</p>\n<p>Colgate said the “community is really ready for this,” and explained that Give Day has already prompted alumni to show support for UCSB on their own social networking sites.</p>\n<p>“I cannot believe all the excitement I am seeing from our alumni, students and staff,” Colgate said in an email. “We have alumni who have volunteered to be “Digital Ambassadors” on Friday and proactively push the Give Day messaging through their social media channels.”</p>\n<p>Online fundraising is “immediate,” Colgate said, and allows donors to choose specific areas for support that they are most passionate about.</p>\n<p>“We have had an online giving site for many years, but this is the first UCSB Give Day where we focus on promoting online giving for 24 hours straight,” Colgate said in an email. “The inaugural effort is perhaps less about that single day as it is about what [Friday] will usher in: a whole new era of fundraising at UCSB.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66219\" style=\"width: 5482px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66219\" data-attachment-id=\"66219\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/sidebar-gallery/nexusstock_stephen-manga-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NexusStock_Stephen-Manga-7.jpg?fit=5472%2C3648&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5472,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"022021012483\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416008395\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NexusStock_Stephen Manga-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NexusStock_Stephen-Manga-7.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NexusStock_Stephen-Manga-7.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66219 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NexusStock_Stephen-Manga-7.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"NexusStock_Stephen Manga-7\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NexusStock_Stephen-Manga-7.jpg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NexusStock_Stephen-Manga-7.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NexusStock_Stephen-Manga-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NexusStock_Stephen-Manga-7.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NexusStock_Stephen-Manga-7.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-66219\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Madison Frame, UCSB First co-chair, said her goal is to engage people with UCSB Give not only by donating, but by participating in Friday’s events.</p>\n<p>“UCSB First is leading the student engagement aspect of Give Day,” Frame said. “Our job is to get students excited about celebrating what an amazing feat it is that UCSB is hosting our first ever Give Day.”</p>\n<p>Frame said she hopes the online aspect of the fundraiser will create an easy way for alumni to access the university.</p>\n<p>“From a student perspective, I can predict that engaging online, whether that be via the official Give Day website, social media or word-of-mouth, will be an accessible way for students to get involved,” Frame said.</p>\n<p>Colgate said she is proud the university is using technology to support the campus in a joint effort with students and alumni.</p>\n<p>“Social media outreach is being used at many institutions, so we’re right in the middle of this wave,” Colgate said in an email. “This is a way to reach a constituency that is involved in non-traditional fundraising.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Give Day will begin on Friday at 12 a.m. Interested participants can access the website at <a href=\"https://giveday.ucsb.edu\" target=\"_blank\">https://giveday.ucsb.edu</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
