There, lying face down, was a victim of overconsumption, dreaming drunken dreams.</p>\n<p>His head half hanging out the opened door, the 19-year-old man was a sight to behold. Chunks of vomit clung to his face, covered his hands, stained his T-shirt and saturated the car seat. A few select chunks had made their way out of the car and were pooled in the gutter.</p>\n<p>The officers shook the sleeping beauty awake, taking extra care not to get vomit on their hands, and collected the out-of-towner’s information. Hoping not to have to arrest him, the deputies asked if the defeated reveler had any friends who could assist him.</p>\n<p>The puking prince told them José would come to his rescue and he pulled out his phone to dial him. However, after shouting his name several times, the officers asked to see the phone and discovered the soiled young man had never dialed the number.</p>\n<p>With no José, the deputies had no recourse but to arrest the young man. A few untimely upchucks notwithstanding, the intoxicated tourist was transferred without incidence to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Fast Times at Estero Park</b></p>\n<p>Sat Jan. 16, 3:54 a.m. – Deputies working the late shift were intrigued when they spotted a car parked in Estero Park with its lights on.</p>\n<p>The officers, making sure not to stand in the pile of sick located beside the car door, shined their flashlights into the vehicle and saw two rather young-looking occupants, one a man and one a woman. A simple tap on the window didn’t wake the slumbering out-of-towners, however, nor did aggressive banging.</p>\n<p>The IVFP doesn’t employ quitters, though, and after nearly two minutes of trying, the deputies were able to wake the sloppy sleepers. What was awaiting them inside the car, however, no one can be trained for.</p>\n<p>First was the smell, horrid and acidic. Next the visual, two young bodies covered entirely in their own puke. Vomit was in their hair, on their clothing, covering their seats and pooled on the floor.</p>\n<p>Two grown adults could live with such an experience – at least their parents wouldn’t have to know. But these vomit-covered visitors were not so lucky: each was only 16 years of age.</p>\n<p>Slightly taken aback, the deputies arrested the pair and transferred them to the Santa Maria Juvenile Hall, where they were housed, pending a serious ass-whopping from the ‘rents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/","id":3825,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3824,3823,3822],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri Jan. 8, 11:15 p.m. - Officers on patrol Friday night were directed towards the corner of Del Playa Drive and Camino Lindo on reports of vehicular vandalism.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The Audacity of Douche</b><br>\nFri Jan. 8, 11:15 p.m. – Officers on patrol Friday night were directed towards the corner of Del Playa Drive and Camino Lindo on reports of vehicular vandalism.</p>\n<p>Minutes earlier, a young man was driving down the 6800 block of DP when a drunken savage came out of nowhere and leaped onto the roof of his car. Taken aback, the driver stepped on the gas and then abruptly hit the brakes in the hopes of shaking the crazed reveler, but succeeded only in shifting his body onto the hood.</p>\n<p>Reacting to this boorish move by the driver, the inebriated cowboy stood up on the hood, shouted “What the fuck?!” and slammed his heel through the front windshield, shattering it instantly.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived some minutes later, and, thanks to their superb training, were able to track down the suspect without difficulty. It was made easier, however, by the fact that their man had managed to fall asleep while standing.</p>\n<p>The officers woke the 20-year-old Menlo Park resident and put him in handcuffs. Having been read his Miranda rights, the vandal turned to the officer and said, “I would like to know what I’m being charged with.” The deputy explained that kicking through a windshield is in fact a crime, to which the suspect replied, “I just want to know what I’m being charged with.”</p>\n<p>Despite several explanations, the inebriated man was unable to comprehend why he was arrested. Nonetheless, the audacious young man was transferred to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>How Not to Win Him Back</b><br>\nThu Jan. 7, 1:15 a.m. – Deputies on patrol were called to an apartment at 760 Embarcadero del Mar early Thursday on reports that an especially intoxicated young lady refused to leave her ex’s abode.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived and found the inebriated 21-year-old in the living room searching for something. She told the deputies she wouldn’t leave without her cell phone battery, but after a moving good cop/bad cop routine, the officers were able to convince her otherwise.</p>\n<p>Love is a difficult beast to break, however. An hour and a half later, the deputies received another call saying that the girl had returned, this time with even more alcohol on her breath. The deputies arrived and escorted her out of the apartment and down the stairs.</p>\n<p>At first refusing to answer any questions, the UCSB student quickly changed tactics and demanded that the officers take her to jail. To prove she was serious, she then ordered them to do so.</p>\n<p>Happy to oblige, the deputies took her to the I.V. substation, where she insisted they give her a breathalyzer test. The deputy instructed her that was not necessary, but she continued to demand one.</p>\n<p>The issue was put to rest, however, when the officers transferred her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/","id":3906,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3905,3904,3903],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"That’s a Bush, Not a Bed Sat., Nov. 14, 12:03 a.m. — A heavily intoxicated man seated on the curb attracted the attention of several passing revelers and, subsequently, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol....","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>That’s a Bush,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Not a Bed</strong></p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 14, 12:03 a.m. — A heavily intoxicated man seated on the curb attracted the attention of several passing revelers and, subsequently, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>Seated near the intersection of Pasado Road and Camino Corto, the 18-year-old had seemingly reached, and then surpassed, his limit. The officers approached the crowd to investigate what was happening.</p>\n<p>According to one of the spectators, they had been walking by when they spotted the student passed out in the bushes. They then dragged him to the curb and attempted to ascertain a place they could take him.</p>\n<p>But as the deputies discovered, the ruined reveler was in no state to be answering questions. Sitting there with his head hanging low, the UCSB student had the whole spectrum of bodily fluids staining his body, including a mucus-covered face, vomit-stained shirt and urine-soaked jeans.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the deputies began dragging the man to a patrol car that they got anything out of him: projectile vomit.</p>\n<p>After soiling the back seat of the patrol car, the man was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Say My Name</strong></p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 21, 10:49 p.m. — An act of drunken vandalism proved disastrous for one Isla Vista resident.</p>\n<p>Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were approached by a distraught female complaining that an inebriated passerby had snapped the antenna off her car. What’s more, she told the officers her friends had kept the vandal in place through the cunning use of distraction.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the 18-year-old man and could immediately tell he was exceptionally drunk. They asked the man his name, to which he replied, “What’s my name.” When asked his age, he replied “What’s my age.”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the inebriated local would answer by simply repeating the question.

After nearly falling on own his volition, the Cal Poly Mustang then stumbled into a fair-skinned Gaucho, who nearly fell herself.</p>\n<p>After being told off, the drunken man turned and tried out his best pick up line: “Fuck you!” But instead of snatching one of Isla Vista’s famed beauties, he was snatched by I.V.’s other famed demographic, the not-so-beautiful Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>A quick conversation with the foul-mouthed Mustang was all the fodder the officers needed, who promptly arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/","id":3905,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3904,3903,3902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., Oct. 16, 11:22 p.m. -- A group of men gathered around an empty lot at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista's finest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The Puking Princess</b></p>\n<p>Fri., Oct. 16, 11:22 p.m. — A group of men gathered around an empty lot at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>As the deputies made their way toward the crowd, they spotted the group’s focal point: a young lady bent over vomiting in the grass.

When officers arrived some minutes later, they found the rambunctious reveler passed out cold in the parking lot behind the building.</p>\n<p>The deputies attempted to rouse the sleepy squatter but he was unable to do anything but crawl around on all fours. And if that weren’t enough proof, the large urine stains on the man’s jeans suggested he was too drunk to take care of himself.</p>\n<p>Despite his self-professed desire to sleep in the parking lot, the officers offered something more comfortable, albeit just barely, and transported the infantile student to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Just a Beer… or 10</b></p>\n<p>Fri.

Having lost his shirt somewhere, the man was led out into the cold night air with dried vomit clinging to his bare chest.</p>\n<p>Always willing to take in a friend in need, the deputies then transported the sleepy squatter to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19450\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19450\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/","id":3902,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3901,3900,3899],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I.V.

Hosts: Dancing With the Idiots</p>\n<p>Fri., Sept. 25, 11:35 p.m. — Officers patrolling a busy Del Playa Drive couldn’t help but take notice as a flamboyant 18-year-old strutted by.</p>\n<p>With revelry in the air, the young man had decided to entertain the masses with his groovy dance moves… from atop a moving car.</p>\n<p>As the vehicle made its way through the crowd surrounding it, the deputies made their way towards the tipsy-toed dancer and yelled at him to get down. The inebriated performer was in the zone, however, and failed to heed the officer’s demand.</p>\n<p>The deputies, having already tried their hands at diplomacy, reverted to plan B and grabbed the artist by the shirt and dragged him to the ground.</p>\n<p>With his run as lead dancer in the Car-top Cabaret over, the rising star was forced to face the music and stood motionless as the deputies slapped on the cuffs.</p>\n<p>And the Damage Done</p>\n<p>Sun., Sept. 27, 1:13 a.m. — A late night altercation in a Del Playa parking lot turned out to be more than one officer could handle.</p>\n<p>Once on the scene, the officers approached a bloodied 18-year-old and asked him what had happened, to which he replied, “Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz…” Pressed further, the out-of-towner continued to ramble about California’s favorite hippie enclave, but ironically, refused to say where he was from.</p>\n<p>With no other options, the deputy arrested him and sat him on the curb to wait for a van to take him to jail. But the slug wasn’t ready to be salted just yet, and while the officer was looking down at his notepad, he made his break and started sprinting down the street.</p>\n<p>The deputy made chase, and his attempts to taser the escapee failed. And then his own legs failed him: just paces from catching up, the officer lost his footing and ate shit in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Officers don’t work alone, though, and a fellow member of the Foot Patrol was able to tackle the fleeing northerner. The damage, however, had already been done.</p>\n<p>If Only It Was Twist-Off</p>\n<p>Fri., Sept. 15, 11:28 p.m. — Deputies on patrol near the intersection of Camino Del Sur and Pasado Road stopped an inebriated man after he stumbled into several parked cars.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the unsteady stroller where he lived, and he was quick to tell them that he lived at “243 Sabado.” But before the deputies could tell him such an address doesn’t exist, he pointed to a house at the corner of the intersection and told them he lived there.</p>\n<p>Feeling pretty certain that the 20-year-old was making things up, the deputies asked the lost boy if he could call a friend to walk him home. The drunken UCSB student said he could and proceeded to pull out his keys from his front pocket.</p>\n<p>Unsure of his intentions, the officers asked him a second time if he would call a friend. This time, the man pointed to a bottle opener attached to his keys and said, “O.K., it’s right here.”</p>\n<p>Whether he thought the bottle opener was a phone, or perhaps a friendly escort, the officers couldn’t tell, but such clarification was not needed to arrest him for public intoxication.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19349\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19349\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/","id":3903,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3902,3901,3900],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Best of Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Wed., Oct. 15, 3:48 p.m. - Deputies enjoying a sunny Wednesday afternoon were called to duty when they witnessed a young lady struggling to walk near the intersection of Embarcadero del Norte and Pica...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Soggy Bottomed Girl<br>\nWed., Oct. 15, 3:48 p.m. – Deputies enjoying a sunny Wednesday afternoon were called to duty when they witnessed a young lady struggling to walk near the intersection of Embarcadero del Norte and Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>The officers watched the stumbling stroller for approximately one block, during which she weaved back and forth, stumbled into innocent passersby and fell into a bush. She had another female with her, but she was not assisting the inebriated.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the 19-year-old woman, and immediately picked up on the strong odor of alcohol coming from her person.</p>\n<p>They asked the young woman where she was coming from and she replied that she had just left her sorority. She was then asked where she was heading, and she replied her sorority.</p>\n<p>When asked how much she had had to drink, she said, “Enough.” After speaking with her friend, the officers learned that they had come from the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity house, where the various sororities had been competing in a “gladiator style” sporting event.</p>\n<p>She was arrested and transported to the Isla Vista sub-station on Trigo Road. There she was placed on a chair in the holding cell, but after a half-hour of repeatedly falling off she was moved to the floor.</p>\n<p>Her intoxication seemed to be increasing, and at times she lost consciousness. Then, she began to urinate, soaking her shorts and the ground that she was sitting on. She made no attempt to move and ultimately passed out in a puddle of her own urine.</p>\n<p>The sorority girl was then transported to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for alcohol overdose, but was ultimately released back to the sheriff’s department and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>You’re No Jim Morrison<br>\nFri., April 25, 12:56 a.m. – Informed by numerous people of a man lying in the grass at Sea Outlook Park, located on the 6800 block of Del Playa Drive, a bicycle patrol officer made his way to the area.</p>\n<p>When the deputy approached the park, he saw a man lying on his side, seemingly unconscious, with both his pants and underwear pulled down to mid-thigh. Despite his apparent efforts to stay dry, his trousers were soaked and the man stunk of urine.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the 23-year old was positioned in such that the view from the street was one featuring his naked ass. Also, the man’s left shoe was removed and sitting near his head.</p>\n<p>The officer, fearing for the inebriated man’s health, called paramedics and attempted to rouse the urine-soaked, half-naked, mostly unconscious partier.</p>\n<p>Succeeding in having the man open his eyes, the deputy asked the pungent-smelling sleeper for some basic information, such as his name and age. This man, however, had simply consumed too much to partake in simple conversation.</p>\n<p>In response to the officer’s questions, the man rambled off a series of no’s and then jammed out on his imaginary air guitar.</p>\n<p>After paramedics determined the man was not in need of immediate medical attention, he was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>\n<p>A Beautiful Mind<br>\nThursday, Jan. 31, 2:12 a.m. – Officers stationed at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office were informed of a drunken woman who was unable to pay the bill for a cab ride.</p>\n<p>The woman, who was dropped off on Pardall Road, was returning from a night out at a Goleta bar.</p>\n<p>The ride-stealing suspect had had a bit too much to drink however, and appeared to have some loose change after all.</p>\n<p>Clearly alone, the woman was convinced there was another person inside the cab when she had entered.</p>\n<p>Putting the issue of the disappearing passenger aside, the officer asked the woman how she had planned to pay for the taxi.</p>\n<p>She calmly told the deputy that she was going to pay the fare of $16.75 using her cell phone. The suspect tried to complete the transaction several times, but despite her sincerest efforts, her mobile would not issue legal tender.</p>\n<p>With her phone apparently void of its magic-giving abilities, the woman lost her composure and resorted to screaming and yelling.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19170\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19170\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/","id":3852,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3851,3850,3849],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Campus Commemorates Veterans","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Honoring Memorial Day one day past, the Student Veterans at UCSB organized thousands of crosses and set them along the strips of lawn on campus Tuesday.

With a bottle of Andre’s sparkling wine in one hand and a cigar in the other, the sunglass-clad 18-year-old was too cool for his own good. The officers stopped the hipster and asked his age. After briefly hesitating, he told the officers he was 21.</p>\n<p>The deputies weren’t fooled, however, and asked to see his ID. The champagne sipper reached for his wallet, paused and then decided it was better to just run. Wine still in hand, he pushed past the officers and sprinted onto DP.</p>\n<p>The officers immediately gave chase, and even tried to taser the sprinting bro, though unsuccessfully. The deputies did manage to spot him zipping into a backyard on Sabado Tarde, and after some cunning police work, officers apprehended the inebriated young man.</p>\n<p>The deputies then escorted him to their patrol car and drove him toward the Santa Barbara County Jail. While in transit, the defeated SBCC student spontaneously told the officers that he only ran because he thought he was going to be arrested. Officers promptly informed him that he would have only received a citation.</p>\n<p>“So you mean I would have just gotten a ticket?” asked the dismayed reveler just before being booked into the jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Don’t Forget to Flush<br>\nSun., May 3, 2:56 a.m. – Employees working the Saturday night shift at Silvergreens Restaurant were all set to go home when they found a surprise in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>There, slouched over the toilet, lay a young woman sound asleep. Attempts to rouse her proved ineffective and the tired-eyed employees instead sought the help of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived some minutes later and were led into the bathroom. There the officers found the 20-year-old sleeping blissfully upon the white ceramic seat, her hair mussed and her pants still around her ankles. She had, it appeared, fallen asleep in the act of peeing.</p>\n<p>So intoxicated was the UCSB student, however, that it took the officers several minutes to wake her from her drunken stupor. Only after lifting her head and vigorously shaking her arm did she even respond.</p>\n<p>Having finally succeeded in rousing her, the deputies attempted to retrieve some basic information. The sloppy sleeper, however, was unable to form coherent words and instead took to spitting repeatedly on the floor.</p>\n<p>With that, the officers arrested the drunken squatter. She was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Hurricane<br>\nMon., May 11, 12:42 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to 6690 Abrego Rd. on reports that a heavily tattooed man was wreaking havoc at the apartment complex.</p>\n<p>A result copious amounts of alcohol and too much testosterone, the inebriated man was a walking disaster. According to the reporting party, the 23-year-old had been breaking glass bottles and smashing bikes, apparently just for the fun of it.</p>\n<p>When the deputies arrived, they found the San Jose native with his pants down urinating on the door to an apartment.

The deputies were happy to oblige.</p>\n<p>After stopping the 20-year-old, who was on his way to a large party at 6567 DP, the deputies asked the pugnacious partier to repeat himself.</p>\n<p>But with Isla Vista’s finest in his face, the smack talker suddenly fell silent. Reveling in the irony, the officers goaded the inebriated man, asking him if he were too drunk to realize what he had said.</p>\n<p>“No, I didn’t say anything,” he said, but the deputies were quick to refresh his memory. After some convincing, the man finally admitted to his actions, saying “I’ve had a lot to drink.”</p>\n<p>The cops, however, were not sympathetic and arrested the man for public intoxication. A quick search revealed the man was also carrying a small baggie filled with leafy marijuana, like icing on the cake.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>No Burritos After Two<br>\nFri., March 24, 2:26 a.m. – Deputies working the late shift were put to work when a late-night Bill’s Bus arrived in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as one particularly inebriated man exited the bus, made his away across the adjacent park and unzipped his pants. Unaware he was being watched, the 23-year-old let it flow, dousing the building he was next to in his own pungent smell.</p>\n<p>Even though he hadn’t yet finished spelling his name in urine, the officers spoke up and kindly asked him to stop peeing on the building.</p>\n<p>The aging UCSB student had a retort ready and told the officers it was okay, “because I keep this business going by purchasing burritos from them.”</p>\n<p>Despite his stellar logic, there was one serious problem with his argument: He was peeing on the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic – a distinctly burrito-free establishment.</p>\n<p>This fact notwithstanding, the man finished his business with the wall and then nearly fell over, prompting the deputies to arrest him and transport him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Taxi Cab Blues<br>\nSat., March 25, 11:48 p.m. – Officers were called to the corner of El Colegio and Los Carnernos Roads after an inebriated man refused to pay for his taxi.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived and learned that the 24-year-old owed 60 dollars to the cab driver, who had tried collecting the tab repeatedly without success. However, after talking with the young man – who was sporting a suit and pink tie – the officers determined that he did not have any money to pay the driver.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Los Angeles native appeared to have no idea where he was. When asked where he had been picked up, the ride snatcher said he had left from Isla Vista. Then, when asked where he had wanted to be dropped off, he told the deputies Isla Vista, again.</p>\n<p>As the officers processed his paperwork, the man became increasingly confused, at one point asking the officer where his car was and whether it had been towed. He seemed not to remember any car ride, however, and later refused to pay.</p>\n<p>His reason: The cab driver was not in the country legally. The validity of this statement notwithstanding, the officers arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The deputy, who was unharmed by the drunken gymnast, asked the young man what he was doing.</p>\n<p>Realizing he was speaking to a figure of authority, the inebriated man stood tall, his back rigid, and shouted, “Pledging my sorority, sir!”</p>\n<p>The gender-confused man didn’t have any identification on him and refused, or was simply unable, to give any personal information to the officers and instead continued to yell about his pledging efforts. Then realizing he was about to be arrested, the self-described Marine dropped to the ground, put his face to the asphalt and put his hands behind his back, shouting, “This is what I do when I get arrested, sir!”</p>\n<p>Not wishing to appear rude, the deputies arrested the hopeful pledge and started toward the patrol car. The drunken serviceman was not done being arrested, though, and dropped to the ground face-down several more times before the officers could get him in the car.</p>\n<p>Once seated, the young man lost his cool and started slamming his head against the Plexiglas divider. A few drunken hissy fits later, the deputy was forced to spray mace into his eyes.</p>\n<p> Eventually the alcohol-laden 22-year-old was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Getting Trashed</p>\n<p>Sun., April 19, 1:25 a.m. — Officers responding to reports of an unresponsive male lying on the ground behind 6571 Del Playa Drive found a heavily intoxicated man struggling to stay upright.</p>\n<p>The deputies contacted the 18-year-old as he was loitering about the large dumpsters behind the ocean-side apartment complex. The young UCSB student was clearly inebriated, as evidenced by the copious amounts of urine and vomit staining his jeans.</p>\n<p>The officers attempted to start a conversation with the man while they waited for paramedics to arrive, but his ability to speak had apparently been drowned in alcohol. He may, however, have just been preoccupied with something else, given that he had both hands stuffed down his heavily soiled pants. No matter the question, the self-fondling dumpster diver just stood there shivering, no doubt chilled by his moist trousers.</p>\n<p>Some time later, the paramedics arrived but eventually released the dubious drunkard back into police custody, who arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was given fresh clothing and housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Double the Drunk</p>\n<p>Sat., April 18, 1:32 a.m. — Deputies on patrol were called to 6681 Del Playa Drive to deal with a reported disturbance.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, the officers witnessed a pair of twin brothers leaving an upstairs party. The two, both well beyond drunk, stumbled towards the staircase: their first obstacle.</p>\n<p>The first brother clutched the handrail tightly, eventually making it down the stairs without incident. His partner in crime, however, went full-bore down the stairs, nearly tumbling several times. It was not until he reached flat ground, however, that gravity won the battle and he fell to the pavement.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the first twin put one foot in front of the other until he reached the second main obstacle: a wooden gate. Having traveled the 30 feet to the gate, the brother could go no farther, fell to the ground and was unable to get back up.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, twin number two recovered from his tumble and made his way to the gate. His attempts to open it, however, were foiled by the fact he reached for the hinge instead of the latch.</p>\n<p>After about a minute of watching the two try to open the gate, the deputies felt obliged and opened it for them. With no other obstacles standing in their way, the 20-year-old twins were arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where they were housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/","id":3850,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3849,3848,3847],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Love may well have been in the air Saturday night, but so too was the familiar smell of alcohol-laden partiers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The City of Love?<br>\nSat. Feb. 14, 10:20 p.m. – Love may well have been in the air Saturday night, but so too was the familiar smell of alcohol-laden partiers.</p>\n<p>Deputies working the Valentine’s Day shift were pulled away from their romantic dreams when a clearly intoxicated individual stumbled out of the apartment complex at 6653 Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>The 18-year-old – who was, not surprisingly, alone and completely hammered – was having a difficult time navigating the parking lot. The officers watched as he stumbled into a parked car, then into a filthy dumpster, back into another parked car and finally out onto the street. There, the pinball wizard continued to run into cars, nearly eating it with every step.</p>\n<p>Stepping in, the deputies contacted the lonely partier and escorted him to the curb. There they tried to talk to the young man, who was not from Isla Vista, but quickly ran into a hurdle: the man could barely speak English.</p>\n<p>Slightly aghast that he was alone on Valentine’s Day, the officers ascertained that the severely drunk man was French. Lucky for them, a random passerby happened to speak the lovely language and started to translate for the deputies.</p>\n<p>The conservation was cut short, however, when the f’ed-up Frenchman leaned over and started to vomit profusely on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>With no other options, the officers arrested the lover-less lover-boy and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Under Intoxicated<br>\nSat. Feb. 14, 12:40 a.m. – A man carrying a full glass of amber-colored liquid stepped out onto the 6700 block of Trigo Road and into the sights of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>Having broken a cardinal rule of drinking in I.V., the inebriated individual made an easy target for the Foot Patrol, who quickly approached him and inquired into the glass’ contents.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the 22-year-old turned and started to pour the beverage onto the ground. Unfortunately for him, he was not quick enough and the officer reached out and grabbed the glass.</p>\n<p>The deputies asked the visiting Burbank resident what was in the glass, and he claimed he didn’t know. Taking him for a liar, the officers then asked if it was beer or hard alcohol, and, with his back to the corner, he said, “Probably beer.”</p>\n<p>Having solved the beverage issue, the deputies then noticed that the man’s shirt was torn from the neckline down, and that his bare, hairless chest was exposed for all to see. The deputies, relying on their deft deduction skills, asked if he had been in a fight and he nodded in agreement, but refused to say with whom.</p>\n<p>Moving on, the officers asked the out-of-towner how much he had had to drink, to which he replied, “Honestly, too much.” Taking that as their cue, they arrested the intoxicated reveler. With the cuffs on, they asked if he knew why he had been arrested and he answered, matter-of-factly, “Because I am under intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>The deputies then proceeded to escort the man to the station, during which time the -year-old looked down at his shirt, and with a puzzled look, asked how it got torn. The officers told him it was that way when they found him, but he said he didn’t believe them.</p>\n<p>The officers didn’t really mind though, because shortly after he was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/","id":3848,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3847,3846,3845],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., Feb. 8, 1:55 a.m. - Officers working the red-eye were called to action when they spotted an inebriated man struggling to walk down the 800 block of Camino del Sur.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>23 Flavors<br>\nSun., Feb. 8, 1:55 a.m. – Officers working the red-eye were called to action when they spotted an inebriated man struggling to walk down the 800 block of Camino del Sur.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the young man, who was carrying a half-full Dr. Pepper bottle, and asked him how he was doing. The out-of-towner quickly put a halt to his swaying saunter and mumbled something incoherent in response.</p>\n<p>The lack of a comprehensible reply was enough of an answer for the officers and they proceeded to ask the 19-year-old what he was drinking. This time the officers didn’t get any response, and instead the young man hung his head low and stared at the street while snot dripped down from his nose.</p>\n<p>At one point, however, the late-night reveler attempted to look up at the officers, but the movement was too much for his alcohol-laden body and he nearly toppled over from a lack of balance.</p>\n<p>With the prospect of constructive conversation out of the question, the officers asked to smell the contents of the bottle. Without saying a word, the young man handed it over and the deputies quickly determined that the beverage was not just Dr. Pepper but an intoxicating cousin of the good doctor.</p>\n<p>Suspecting that the underage partier may have more than a spiked Dr. Pepper on his person, the officers asked the busted whippersnapper if they could check his pockets, which he unfortunately agreed to. A quick frisk later, the officers discovered two pill bottles filled with marijuana and another small box with additional herb and a small white pill, later identified as Xanax.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the sloppy stoner didn’t have a prescription for the pot or the Xanax and was arrested for public intoxication as well as possession of a controlled substance. He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Witch Made Me Do It<br>\nThurs., Feb. 5, 1:59 a.m. – Deputies rounding the Embarcadero loop early Thursday morning suddenly found themselves in a Technicolor adventure, Isla Vista style.</p>\n<p>There, in front of the Isla Vista Medical Center, was a yellow brick road of sorts. Only instead of bricks, the path consisted of urine-stained cement. With the musk of human waste in the air, Isla Vista’s finest were off.</p>\n<p>Following the sodden trail to its headwaters, the deputies discovered the source: an intoxicated transient asleep at the door of the medical center. Only there was no man behind the curtain; what they saw was what they got, and the officers quickly determined the river of human piss was coming from the pants of the sleeping squatter.</p>\n<p>Since “camping” on a public sidewalk is illegal, the deputies awoke the passed-out pisser and told him to stand up. The 47-year-old did as he was told, but had to rely heavily on the support of the door to maintain his balance.</p>\n<p>The deputies noted that his pants were soaked in his own bodily fluids, yet nonetheless searched the man – with his consent – for any drugs or weapons.</p>\n<p>Having failed to produce any contraband, the officers arrested the trespassing transient for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The University of Santa California, Barbara<br>\nSat., Feb. 7, 12:34 a.m. – Officers braving a cold and wet Isla Vista night spotted a young male snooping around a fenced yard and decided to investigate.</p>\n<p>The UCSB student was staggering around a fence on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Rd., clearly intoxicated. So unsure was his footing that he had to resort to crouching by the fence to keep from falling over.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the sloppy squatter and asked him if he was all right. Caught off guard, the 20-year-old turned to walk towards the officers but instead slipped and ate it.</p>\n<p>Now on the ground, the intoxicated man assured the officers that he was fine and that he was simply waiting for a friend to arrive.</p>\n<p>The deputy reached down and gave the fallen soldier a hand getting to his feet, and kept his arm there in case his balance gave out a second time.</p>\n<p>The officers then proceeded to ask the standard array of questions – name, address, age – but when they got to his school, the drunken student had some problems. “U-S-C-B,” was his first attempt, quickly followed by “U-C-B-S.”</p>\n<p>With all the evidence they needed, the deputies arrested the tipsy, tongue-tied traveler for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18295\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18295\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/","id":3847,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3846,3845,3844],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":155,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
