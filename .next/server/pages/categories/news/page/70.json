behavior,” dogs in their mating cycles and puppies younger than four months of age from entering parks that are designated as “off-leash.”</p>\n<p>This would be the first time IVRPD establishes leash laws.</p>\n<p>The 10 “off-leash” parks would be Camino Pescadero, Little Acorn, Perfect, People’s, Estero, Gaffney, Trigo-Pasado, Greek, Tipi Village and Sueno Orchard.</p>\n<p>All of the above parks,

on weekdays but leashed on weekends.</p>\n<p>These restrictions would not apply to the county-owned Sea Lookout Park.</p>\n<p>The draft ordinance would allow leashed dogs to visit any park.</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said at the meeting that the board had directed IVRPD staff to draft the leash ordinance because members of the public have experienced some aggressive

felt they had a voice in these important issues and establish a mechanism for us to share information to the students about what is happening in this area,” UC Systemwide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>The board will consist of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members. <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KP3WLYN\">Applications</a> are due on Thursday, Nov. 30 at 5 p.m., and the selected board members will receive news of their acceptance in January.</p>\n<p>Board members will serve for one year with the exception of board members chosen in January, who will serve a year and a half term.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students (A.S.) President Hieu Le, he and other stakeholders worked with Salvaty and Title IX Program Coordinator Evelyn Cheng to create the board.</p>\n<p>He added that SAB members will be able to hold decision-makers accountable, as they will be involved in the “procedures, implementation and enforcement of both Title IX and the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence.”</p>\n<p>Le said he was involved in discussing the board’s duties and the qualifications for those who will serve. Board members must be heavily involved within their student communities and have expertise on issues relating to sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The University of California Title IX Office, responsible for <a href=\"http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SVSH\">UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment</a>, will seek critical feedback from the board.</p>\n<p>Board members are expected to provide information to their campuses regarding sexual violence and sexual harassment response and prevention efforts being made by the system-wide office.</p>\n<p>A panel of UC Santa Barbara administration members said the board members should be compensated at a town hall meeting that took place on Tuesday, Nov. 14, which focused on updates regarding the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nowUCsbDemands2.0May32017.pdf\">sexual assault demands</a> made by nowUCsb during their <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">sit-in this May</a>.</p>\n<p>The panel agreed to deliver the message to the administration in charge of the SAB.</p>\n<p>“This is a volunteer board,” Salvaty emailed when asked whether she believed that the students on the board should be paid.</p>\n<p>“I am really looking forward to working with and learning from the student board members.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.7 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

(S.A.N.) at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2016. At the time, he was prepared to organize social justice movements under a Clinton presidency.</p>\n<p>When Donald Trump won the election, Villalobos had to change his plans.</p>\n<p>“I threw myself more into S.A.N. It’s like a full time job for me,” Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>The Student Activist Network is a student-run social justice organization that organizes demonstrations and protests for racial justice, gender equality, immigration, workers’ rights and other issues</p>\n<p>Since Election Day 2016, the network has organized and participated in several on-campus and local demonstrations, including protests after election day, a May Day rally for laborer rights, a rally against rape culture and a sit-in at Cheadle Hall with Fossil Free UCSB.</p>\n<p>Mayela Morales, a fourth-year Chican@ studies and global studies double major, is the head organizer of S.A.N. She became involved in student activism when she started taking Chican@ studies courses at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The biggest change Morales has witnessed in the U.S. since Trump became president is an increase in outward racism throughout the nation.</p>\n<p>She said Trump’s policies, like the administration’s travel ban in March and the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September, have spurred racist rhetoric and sentiments.</p>\n<p>“It always comes back to targeting a community in particular,” she said. “Racism has become more blunt — it’s just straight up in your face.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a more organized racism and misogyny,” Villalobos said, agreeing with Morales. “It’s here, it’s present and we’ll organize against it.”</p>\n<p>Racial justice is one of the Student Activist Network’s seven key issues, Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>The group has an organized a caucus for each of the seven issues: racial justice, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration, the environment, workers’ rights and student movements.</p>\n<p>Morales said many of the caucuses have organized projects in direct relation to the Trump administration’s policies, including Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’s repeal of Obama-era Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>The feminist caucus, for example, is collaborating with Ro Earvin, a UCSB student who presented a list of demands to Chancellor Henry T. Yang in May to reform how the university handles sexual violence.</p>\n<p>S.A.N. is also working to create anti-war and anti-police caucuses, Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the Student Activist Network printed 500 copies of its “Disorientation Guide,” a booklet that contains historical information about student movements and activism at UCSB, as well as information on labor unions and housing cooperatives.</p>\n<p>“When you come to the university, you get an orientation packet,” Villalobos said. “This is the same thing except it’s from a radical perspective. This shows students [UCSB] is not just a place where you go to class, get your degree and leave.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said the “Disorientation Guide” will helps students understand the impact students have made on UCSB’s history and know how to better organize against oppression today.</p>\n<p>“When I started S.A.N., it was a piece of beat-up notebook paper,” Villalobos said, reflecting on how much the organization and its structure have changed in the past year.</p>\n<p>Today, the group has a head organizer, an internal organizer, treasurer, a meeting facilitator and a central organizing committee.</p>\n<p>The network also holds core organizing meetings, during which the board discusses long term plans, and general body meetings, in which all caucuses meet together to work on their projects.</p>\n<p>The Student Activist Network is open to anyone interested in joining<strong>, </strong>Villalobos said, which is an aspect of the organization he believes makes it unique on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re a radical student group, but we accept everyone,” he said, adding that without limits based on political affiliation or identity, the network is able to address a variety of social issues that affect different groups.</p>\n<p>Villalobos also said the Student Activist Network wants to educate more incoming students about the history of movement-based activism and getting involved.</p>\n<p>“The university is a site of struggle, and historically there’s been a lot of action,” he said.</p>\n<p>Villalobos, who will graduate at the end of Fall Quarter, said he wants to keep students engaged with movement-based politics even after the Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>While the Trump administration has inspired more people to become activists, Villalobos said, movements against racism, transphobia, misogyny and gender inequality have always existed.</p>\n<p>“There’s the resistance to all these things that have existed before [Trump] and will exist afterwards,” he added. “They have to be resisted either way.”</p>\n<p>As the Student Activist Network looks toward the future, Villalobos said it is important for students to remain resilient and dedicated to social justice even after Trump leaves office.</p>\n<p>“The message has been like the Democrats aren’t going to save you, the elections aren’t going to save you necessarily,” he said. “We have to save ourselves.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Approximately 100 students, faculty and community members settled in the room Wednesday evening to listen to seven faculty panelists and ask questions about the political and social climate.</p>\n<p>“This past year was even worse than I initially thought it would be — and I’m a pessimist,” said Lisa Park, professor and chair of the department of Asian-American studies.</p>\n<p>The university hosted a similar event last November after the Associated Students funded $5,000 to the College Republicans to host conservative speaker Ben Shapiro.</p>\n<p>Margaret Klawunn, who was one of the organizers of last year’s faculty forum, said the university wanted to continue last year’s dialogue and discuss the “divisive” politics in the U.S. today.</p>\n<p>The panelists shared their thoughts about how the Trump presidency has bolstered racist and sexist rhetoric throughout the nation, as well as the way it has marginalized minority communities.</p>\n<p>“How do you have a continual resistance against the ‘bully-in-chief’?” asked Eileen Boris, professor of feminist studies, citing Trump’s hostile rhetoric against women and the transgender community.</p>\n<p>Boris said Trump was elected because liberal voters did not hold Democratic leaders accountable through continued advocacy for social change during the Obama administration.</p>\n<p>She warned voters to avoid becoming complacent in Santa Barbara, where the majority of the political leaders are Democrats.</p>\n<p>“Even when we have our first Latino mayor and progressives [in Santa Barbara], we have to be there putting pressure,” Boris said. “That’s one of the lessons of history.”</p>\n<p>While the panelists expressed how disheartened they felt throughout the past year, they also encouraged students to seek out spaces to communicate with one another to resist the president’s policies.</p>\n<p>“We need each other desperately,” Park said. “We all belong here, every one of us. We have to celebrate like we own the place — because we do.”</p>\n<p>“We are many, and they are few,” added Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, professor of Chican@ studies.</p>\n<p>Eric Smith, professor of political science, told the <em>Nexus</em> on Tuesday that the national pushback and activism in response to the Trump administration is similar to the state of the nation in the 1960s during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>He explained that the U.S. must have a two-party political system in order to maintain balance. He said, however, the polarization between liberal and conservative Americans grew stronger during the presidential election campaign.</p>\n<p>Smith noted the way the UCSB campus has experienced its own polarization in the past few years and encouraged the university to host more events that bridge the divide between liberal and conservative students.</p>\n<p>Smith added, however, that there has been destructive actions on both sides. College Republicans’ signs announcing Ben Shapiro were vandalized with spray paint in February.</p>\n<p>“The majority of the campus is liberal on social issues,” Smith said. “Conservatives are feeling attacked and because of that, they’re afraid to speak out in public.”</p>\n<p>In April 2016, controversial pro-Trump graffiti was written in chalk on the ground near the North Hall mural and South Hall, which holds the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies.</p>\n<p>“If they felt more comfortable speaking up, there would be less of [those] personal attacks,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Klawunn told the <em>Nexus</em> on Wednesday that since the election, the university has mobilized efforts to create more spaces for students to discuss controversial issues.</p>\n<p>The UCSB chapter of Young Americans for Liberty began hosting events in the Hub in the UCen to open the dialogue on campus about oftentimes controversial topics. In October, the group organized a debate on free speech in relation to extremist groups.</p>\n<p>The group also organized a discussion on the ethics of abortion on Wednesday, Nov. 8.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said the university plans to hold another forum about free speech during Winter Quarter to encourage students on both sides of the issue to voice their opinions.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to continue to have different opportunities,” Klawunn said. “Each opportunity can’t do everything but we hope we’ll offer a lot of different perspectives.”</p>\n<p>Vilna Bashi Treitler, professor and chair of the black studies department, said at the forum that she feels “optimistic” about the future because she has seen the way Americans have mobilized in response to the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“Oppression and dominance have been with us and may always be with us,” Treitler said. “We get knocked down but we can get back up again.”</p>\n<p>After the forum, the event moved to Storke Plaza, where attendees held blue LED lights and listened to the Chumash Inter-tribal Singers perform songs of survival and resilience.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor race, Bruce Porter, held an early lead in the voting booths, while news sources were reporting that the country’s new president would be inheriting a politically fractured nation.</p>\n<p>Democrats everywhere felt the sobering start of a new era with President Donald Trump’s election later that night, but Hartmann was supposed to be celebrating a milestone in her public service career — <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\">her appointment as a county supervisor</a>.</p>\n<p>Hartmann and Gina Fischer, a highly-involved staff member in Hartmann’s Isla Vista projects and representative for the Third District office, agree that the night of the election was a somber time. In response, Fischer said some constituents turned to Hartmann and local government to ease their dissatisfaction with national politics.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said the fact that her election coincided with Trump’s placed an additional responsibility on her office to listen to constituents and bring people together rather than divide them.</p>\n<p>Constituents from I.V. and UC Santa Barbara in particular would be expecting focused representation for their communities from Hartmann. When those precincts were counted, Hartmann’s votes took a significant jump.</p>\n<p>In return for their votes, Hartmann has had a busy and effective year working on I.V. infrastructure, public safety and support for the I.V. Community Services District, which has benefitted from donations from Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p>She has worked to get the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) off the ground, giving the newly-formed government start-up funds, leasing them the previous Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr’s office and giving them a space to provide programs in the community room of the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Because a large number of the county’s residents live in unincorporated areas, it is Hartmann’s responsibility to represent those constituents, making I.V.’s self-determination through the CSD even more important.</p>\n<p>“I am always scampering around from Guadalupe to Vandenberg Village to Los Alamos to Solvang to I.V. to here in Santa Barbara. So now I.V. has its own government, and to see that begin to take shape is really exciting,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>Fischer said Hartmann’s office is interested in “culturing conditions for [the] CSD to grow,” giving the new government an opportunity to represent its constituents in a way that might previously have been more difficult through the county.</p>\n<p>“We’re watching something very exciting be born and I’m delighted to be one of the midwives of many for that process,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board Chair Ethan Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday he’s had “nothing but good experiences” working with Hartman and her staff, saying she has always been attentive and willing to help constituents.</p>\n<p>“Without Supervisor Hartmann’s early support, we wouldn’t have been able to begin providing services so quickly,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s office contributed $3,000 from their discretionary funds in the last fiscal year and $2,000 in the current year, he said, which has helped the district in their start-up costs.</p>\n<p>Since its creation, the I.V. CSD has created an internship program in collaboration with UCSB’s Department of Political Science, managed scheduling for the community room and launched an expansion of the Community Service Organization’s escort program.</p>\n<p>The District has also developed a policy manual, hired legal counsel and acquired insurance, fulfilling critical steps in its formation.</p>\n<p>Bertrand expressed praise for Hartmann’s work in I.V. and said that the county’s infrastructure improvements have been especially helpful for her constituents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/\">The county Public Works Department installed a stoplight in August</a> at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte, citing a need to mitigate the amounts of collisions in the area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/\">The county also installed a sidewalk</a> on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road last spring.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Hartmann’s work on public safety issues through the I.V. Safe task force has helped people better understand the issues they are facing in the community through her focus on the data involved in these subjects.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said her office’s number one priority is to keep students safe and said she was pleased that this year’s Halloween weekend saw fewer arrests and medical transports.</p>\n<p>While Hartmann has focused on helping her constituents by attempting to support I.V.’s bid for self-governance through the CSD, a main focus of hers going forward will be helping the Community Center become a source for community programming for her diverse constituency.</p>\n<p>“We got a grant for $460,000 to add to money that the county had already invested in the community center, and then we had to delay opening the community center,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We expect to bring everybody in Isla Vista from different age groups, different ethnicities, different — not everyone will be students — and hope that we can create a stronger sense of belonging to the I.V. community,” she said.</p>\n<p>She said she also hopes to soon build a “pipeline” between UCSB and the county to bring students into the county.</p>\n<p>Despite what she said was a “steep learning curve” to the first year of her term, Hartmann said the work has been fun, and she has built connections with I.V. officials like Bertrand who have said working with her is a “true pleasure.”</p>\n<p>Constituents will continue to look for strong leadership in Hartmann and other local elected officials, as students and I.V. residents have shown that they are resistant to the changes occurring on the national level.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Executive Director Marisela Márquez gave an opening remark about her personal connection to the tragedy because she previously lived in San Antonio, Texas, an hour away from where the shooting happened.</p>\n<p>“It is odd to see your hometown through the television screen … it doesn’t have to be like this,” Márquez said, referencing the long-debated issue of gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“Many of us, including myself, read headline after headline, and it can feel distant,” said Kristin Hsu, a fourth-year Asian-American studies major and A.S. external vice-president for statewide affairs.</p>\n<p>“Holding a space where people can share their emotions and responses encourages the UCSB community to seek support in times of need and to not be afraid in doing so,” Hsu added.</p>\n<p>Attendees also discussed the wide availability of guns in the United States, the blame on mental illness for shootings and the stricter gun laws in countries such as Japan and Australia.</p>\n<p>Director of UCSB’s MultiCultural Center Zaveeni Khan-Marcus also spoke about the prejudice that appears against members of the Muslim community when mass shootings happen in the United States.</p>\n<p>Brandt spoke about the May 23, 2014, shooting in Isla Vista and said it is “easy to feel hopeless” when similar events take place around the country.</p>\n<p>“The collective trauma that links from 2014 is a very real thing and it’s important for people to have a space to process that,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to mourn and heal over innocent lives lost together, especially when our community has been touched by similar tragedy and violence,” Hsu added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79559\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79559\" data-attachment-id=\"79559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-08/students-hold-vigil-for-victims-of-sutherland-springs-tragedy/community-members-share-their-experience-at-the-vigil-for-texas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1334&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1334\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Community members share their experience at the Vigil for Texas\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79559\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Leaders of the Isla Vista Community Service District Spencer Brandt (center) and Jonathan Abboud joined the vigil. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Vigil attendees also discussed the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 that killed 58 people. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-03/isla-vistans-share-fears-frustrations-after-mass-shooting-in-las-vegas/\">Students hosted a vigil for the shooting on Oct. 3</a> in the I.V.

Users also have the option to attach a large umbrella to the back of the chair.</p>\n<p>Beachgoers can access the chair free of charge at the Adventure Program’s Campus Point Rentals center or through the Rec Cen.</p>\n<p>Cathy Czuleger, senior associate director for programming, information technology and development for the Department of Recreation, said the Rec Cen first purchased the beach wheelchair with funding from the Adapted Recreation Program 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>The Adapted Recreation Program is a Santa Barbara organization that provides outdoor services to community members with special needs.</p>\n<p>She said when the program ended, the wheelchair became “rusty and unusable” so the Rec Cen contacted CF to fund a new chair.</p>\n<p>The Rec Cen proposed the project to CF and applied for funding during winter 2016, said Peter Min, outreach coordinator for CF.</p>\n<p>“The program ended, and the wheelchair was not maintained or easily available for use during the past 10 years,” Min said.</p>\n<p>Czuleger said she decided to write a proposal to CF requesting money to purchase a new chair and said she was happy with the organization’s “generous” funding allocation.</p>\n<p>According to Min, CF accepts proposals for research, projects and internships every quarter and critically reviews them to see if they are compatible with the organization’s mission statement, the student community and their goal to preserve the shoreline and marine life.</p>\n<p>CF receives funds from all UCSB students through a lock-in student fee every quarter. Each undergraduate student contributes $5.75 per quarter and each graduate student contributes $3.00 per quarter.</p>\n<p>CF provides over $350,000 each year to preserve UCSB’s beaches and has distributed over $3 million locally since the fall of 1999.</p>\n<p>If students wish to earn funding for their own group or organization, they can participate in CF’s restoration projects and beach clean-ups.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

requirements necessary for off-campus vendors like Camacho to sell on campus with student organizations.</p>\n<p>Camacho is currently working to obtain the necessary insurance and permits to work on campus again.</p>\n<p>Once UCSB approves Camacho’s current food permit and an insurance policy, he can sell with campus organizations once a month.</p>\n<p>“The next time we could see Mr. Camacho selling on campus is after he submits his certificate of insurance and is listed on the Approved Caterers list,” Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, said.</p>\n<p>According to Ashlock, the insurance policy can be obtained “in a matter of days, not weeks.”</p>\n<p>OSL’s requirements outline the steps for vendors to become fully certified to sell on campus, including a prerequisite that vendors have the necessary permits and insurance prior to selling.</p>\n<p>The university prohibited Camacho from selling on campus at the beginning of Fall Quarter because he did not have the correct permits and insurance, the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/\">reported</a> in October.</p>\n<p>Camacho met with OSL on Oct. 17 to discuss the new process of selling with on campus organizations.</p>\n<p>University vendors must first contact Campus Concessions for permission to sell on campus, according to OSL. Campus Concessions will then grant permission to sell if the vendor is on the university’s approved caterers list.</p>\n<p>Vendors on the approved caterers list must have general liability insurance that covers up to $2 million in liability and include the Regents of the University of California in the coverage.</p>\n<p>The university also requires that vendors have a Mobile Food Facility (MFF) permit or a general Santa Barbara County permit. The MFF permits range from $130 to $200 depending on the type of food sold and allows for vendors to sell on campus once a week.</p>\n<p>After the vendor is approved to sell on campus, they must fill out the Food Permit Application with Campus Concessions and awaits further approval from OSL and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.</p>\n<p>According to OSL’s regulations, vendors with a non-MFF food permit and an insurance that meets UCSB’s requirements will be allowed to sell only once a month. A vendor with insurance and a MFF type food permit will be able to sell once a week.</p>\n<p>Qualifying vendors may only sell at the SRB and only one off-campus vendor is allowed to sell per day.</p>\n<p>OSL met with representatives from student organizations on Oct. 20 to clarify the requirements and process of using off-campus vendors for fundraisers.</p>\n<p>The current off-campus vendors list has 26 approved vendors, including Silvergreens and Woodstock’s Pizza, and 29 vendors that are not approved to sell on campus. Camacho is not currently on the approved caterers list or the non-approved vendors list.</p>\n<p>Once the university approves a vendor for on-campus sales, the vendor will receive four complementary food permits from Campus Concessions. All permit after the fourth will cost $50 and each permit is valid for one day.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year, students noticed Camacho’s absence and questioned why he was no longer selling at the SRB.</p>\n<p>Jorge Santos, an Associated Students on-campus senator, said he contacted OSL to learn more about Camacho’s situation. Santos addressed the issues surrounding Camacho’s permission to sell on campus in a Facebook post on Oct. 25.</p>\n<p>“The Office of Student Life not only reached out to [Camacho] but have worked and are doing the most they can to get him back on campus as soon as possible.” Santos’ post read.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 2, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

IVRPD will repeat the process to re-pipe the parks for the recycled water.</p>\n<p>IVRPD began gathering funds for the project when Measure O <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-09/measure-o-passes-will-fund-i-v-park-services/\">passed</a> in May 2017. The local ballot measure implemented a new property tax that adds an estimated $256,358 to the district’s annual <a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/budgets/17-18%20Approved%20Final%20Budget%20Formatted.pdf\">budget</a>.</p>\n<p>Gould said he is “hopeful” the district can begin construction in the latter half of 2018, but said a start date in spring 2019 is “more realistic.”</p>\n<p>Gould also said bringing in recycled water would help increase irrigation in I.V. parks, such as Greek Park and Pardall Gardens, without negatively impacting the region’s drinking water supply.</p>\n<p>David Matson, assistant general manager of the Goleta Water District (GWD), said recycled water benefits both the local community and the environment.</p>\n<p>“Using recycled water for irrigation directly offsets the use of drinking water, thus preserving it for the community,” Matson said in an email.</p>\n<p>In addition, irrigation with locally recycled water saves energy by reducing demand for imported water from other areas, Matson said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD’s recycled water project will add to recycled irrigation that already exists in the area.</p>\n<p>According to Matson, more than 90 percent of UC Santa Barbara’s irrigation involves the use of recycled water.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD Board of Directors approved recycled-water irrigation in its parks during an Oct. 12 board meeting.</p>\n<p>The Board was concerned that the recycled water would be too expensive, but decided to move forward believing the project to be safe enough to proceed with.</p>\n<p>The reclaimed water project would involve the installation of a purple pipe to supply water to the parks’ irrigation systems; a purple pipe is specifically designated for carrying reclaimed water.</p>\n<p>Recycled or reclaimed water is wastewater that has gone through a series of filtrations and treatments until it is clean enough to be reintegrated into the water supply in some form or another.</p>\n<p>According to Hugo Loaiciga, professor of geography and hydrology at UCSB, most of the reclaimed water in California is non-potable, or not safe for drinking.</p>\n<p>Non-potable recycled water is used to irrigate landscapes and plants not intended for eating. IVRPD would integrate non-potable reclaimed water into its irrigation system.</p>\n<p>Loaiciga said the process of reclaiming non-potable water begins with filtering raw sewage to remove large solids. Coagulants are added to condense smaller solids to aid removal of the material.</p>\n<p>Aerobic degradation breaks down organic matter, and a chlorinated substance helps further decontaminate the water. A final round of filtration and reverse osmosis make the water ready for non-potable use.</p>\n<p>“Our actions were guided by a sense of regional responsibility,” Gould said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>A
