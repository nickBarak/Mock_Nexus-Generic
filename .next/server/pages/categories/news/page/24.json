Well, the UC Santa Barbara Surf Team is bringing both with their Stoked N’ Broke benefit concert on Oct. 20. Grab a friend or five and head on down to 6559 Segovia Road from noon until 5 p.m. for live music from I.V.’s best local bands, as well as a closing set by guests from San Luis Obispo. For just a $5 entrance fee, you will be automatically entered into a raffle to win prizes such as a surfboard, surf lessons and a private photo shoot, among other rad prizes you don’t want to miss. So don’t sleep on the center of UCSB’s stoke and help keep I.V.’s resident shredders in the water and competing statewide. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Carbs Against Carbon</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love pizza? Hate contributing to a massive carbon footprint? What a coincidence, so does UCSB’s Excursion Club! Isla Vista’s resident outdoor enthusiasts will be hosting a fundraiser at Woodstock’s on Oct. 24 from 5 p.m. until 10 p.m. to support the Carbon Fund, a nonprofit leading the fight against climate change. Excursion Club is encouraging all clubs on campus to go carbon-free, and what better way to get that mission across than with pizza?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Beautiful Bodies Clothing Swap</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In honor of Love Your Body Week, the Isla Vista Trading Post (IVTP) will be teaming up with the Women’s Center for another one of their famous clothing swaps. Taking place in the Student Resource Building Multipurpose Room on Oct. 23 from 5:30 to 8 p.m., the event encourages folks of all shapes, sizes and identities to come out and learn all about sustainable clothing practices, as well as how clothing can reflect body positivity. Abiding by the IVTP’s golden rule of “three for free,” attendees will be able to walk away with three free items of clothing. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Have A Laugh!</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embarcadero Hall will be transformed from dowdy lecture hall to hip and happenin’ comedy club on Saturday night, thanks to Laughology, UCSB’s premiere standup comedy group. Highlighting the show will be Trevor Wallace, who is best known for his “ain’t no laws when you’re drinking Claws” viral video in support of White Claws (which earned him a cease and desist order from the hard seltzer connoisseurs). The show, which will take place from 8 to 11, is free! </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/","id":4244,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4243,4242,4241],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Food Bank area. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Basic Needs Resource Center (BNRC) would place various Associated Students (A.S.) resource entities under the purview of the current A.S. Food Bank, which would be renamed to the “A.S. Food Bank and Basic Needs Resource Center” and include the A.S. Food Bank, Child Care Grant, A.S./Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) Emergency Grants, the Community Financial Fund Grant and the Graduate Student Association Food Pantry, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. President Alison Sir began working on the BNRC over the summer along with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So Marisela and I created a proposal this summer when we realized that this $1.2 million from UC Office of the President was going to be sent to each campus, and we decided this would be a great opportunity for A.S. Food Bank,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the opportunity to centralize A.S. basic needs resources, Sir hopes the center will eventually consolidate financial workshops and CalFresh advocates in one place for students to access. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BNRC would not be in a different location but would move into the current A.S. Food Bank area. One key element of the BNRC is a case management system, which would track what students are accessing in order to assess student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was authored by On-Campus Senator Adalis Rojas and seconded by Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi and calls senators to “support its expansion and work to reach out to the UCSB community about these opportunities,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas’ resolution also addresses a separate A.S. project </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an A.S. book grant, which will provide funding for students to purchase textbooks.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas told her fellow senators during Wednesday’s meeting that this resolution is a way to “centralize what students’ needs are instead of everything being scattered about.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I spoke to Alison and Marisela and we did consider making it two separate resolutions, but they both advised for me to just include it under one, so that’s just how it came out to be,” Rojas said to the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said one of her key senate campaign platforms was textbook affordability, so when  Márquez approached Senate last week about authoring resolutions for the BNRC and the A.S. Book Bank, she decided to write both into one resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do know that food insecurity and textbook affordability is a huge, popular issue among the senators that we all want to solve,” Rojas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution states that the current EOP Emergency Grant can be used for textbooks but only if a textbook has been lost, damaged or stolen </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not in the case of students who cannot afford textbooks at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has not yet announced how the new book grant funds will be allocated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Hadidi referenced last Friday’s Basic Needs Town Hall, held at Corwin Pavilion, where students addressed both campus and local leaders about accessibility to basic resources to combat food insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many students have a lot of issues with what’s going on in their lives on campus. I think there’s a lot of concerns about housing and homelessness for students and right now we can’t address that, so I think supporting this resolution is really important,” Hadidi said to her fellow senators during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has not unveiled a timeline for either the BNRC or the book grant to be set in motion. Currently, Márquez and Sir are working to source more contribution from financial boards for the BNRC and are trying to gain more student support for both of the measures. </span></p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD (pictured above at a meeting) agreed to do so in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">January</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of this year. </span><em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Survivor Resource Center, located in the center of Isla Vista, provides a location where survivors of sexual assault can go to receive counseling, connections to medical, legal or police services and other services Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) generally  provides such as confidential counseling. For privacy, individuals can only receive the exact address of the center by calling (805) 564-3696.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center’s beginnings can be traced back to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when over 100 students engaged in a nine-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office calling for the university to accept 12 demands meant to reform how the school addresses sexual violence. The first of those demands directed UC Santa Barbara to open a resource center for survivors of sexual assault. UCSB did not end up opening a center, but Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) agreed to do so in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">January</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of this year after it was approached by Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Community members wanted one place where they knew that they could send people or come on a regular basis as needed,” Elsa Granados, executive director of STESA, said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s 2 in the morning or 2 in the afternoon; we have a counselor available.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center strives to serve the entire I.V. community, not just students, according to Granados.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Often people think that when there are sexual assaults in Isla Vista, [they think] they only [happen to] UCSB students,” said Granados. “UCSB students do experience sexual assault, but there’s a greater community here in Isla Vista that experiences sexual assault. Low income families, monolingual spanish speakers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the center, STESA, which is based in Santa Barbara city but operates throughout the county, would send advocates wherever a survivor in need was. The new location offers a fixed space that survivors can walk into, rather than making a call, Granados said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STESA will pay exactly one dollar in rent a year to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), which is allowing them to use space in a building owned by Santa Barbara County that was previously used for storage and as an office for former Supervisor Doreen Farr before that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD spent roughly $5,000 in the lead-up to the center’s opening, buying furniture and renovating the space, according to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD. The money came from the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">user utility tax granted by Measure R</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which the I.V. CSD didn’t have when they began working with STESA to provide the new center, Abboud added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our big contribution was acquiring the space and designating it for this purpose, and funding the upgrades needed to get it to be the nice relaxing space it is now,” Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center provides a variety of resources for sexual assault survivors, but STESA’s most commonly used service is a 24-hour hotline that survivors can use to call and connect with an advocate. Other resources include counseling, assistance with filing official reports or direction to medical services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center intentionally does not maintain a police presence, as some survivors may feel uncomfortable around police officers, according to Granados. Reporting to the police is an option STESA presents to survivors of sexual assault but does not pressure them to follow that course of action, Granados added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Someone might say ‘I don’t want to report to law enforcement, but I am worried about what happened to my body and I’m worried that I might have internal injuries’ and so then we can refer them to a medical clinic,” Granados said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 29 reported rapes to UCSB Police in 2018, according to the 2019 </span><a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/2019_Annual_Security_Report.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act crime report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These numbers do not include reports submitted to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), which also patrols I.V. However, in </span><a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv16.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a report which found that 80% of rapes and sexual assaults are not reported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The police often refer survivors to STESA, and according to University of California Police Department Detective Alexis Dougherty, the new center will provide a location where police can meet with survivors in a more comfortable location.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This center is fantastic because it will allow us to see different survivors in this community,” Dougherty said. “It’s not just UCSB students in Isla Vista; we’ll be able to work with survivors in this space.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) board members, county officials and I.V. residents gathered at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar to celebrate the new Isla Vista Community Center’s soft opening. The hard opening date has yet to be released, but I.V. CSD board members are hoping to hold an  official opening sometime between January and March to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the February 1970 I.V. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bank burning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re here celebrating how far we’ve come because it wasn’t that long ago, this building was about to fall over,” said I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no current activities or initiatives are slated for the community center, Brandt said he was interested in using the space to run a variety of programs. Potential ways in which residents may be able to use the space include English classes, homework help for school children, computer literacy classes, yoga classes and a litany of other similar programs, according to Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD paid the Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) $177,000, using funds obtained by a tax on all I.V. residents’ utilities, to manage the community center for one year, according to Lori Goodman, executive director of IVYP. Goodman added that approximately $150,000 of the money will be used to pay its two full-time staff members, while the rest is for potential programs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The County of Santa Barbara paid for the majority of renovations to the building, spending $1,320,000 to replace the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, build two bathrooms and install a kitchen. About $400,000 of that money came from the county’s general fund, according to Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann; the rest came from the federal government through Community Development Block Grants, which Hartmann said made the project possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on community feedback, the I.V. CSD is planning additional renovations to the building, including covering the cement ground of the center with hardwood floor. The district is also looking into grants which could further fund renovations, according to Brandt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This space has always been a hub for the community of Isla Vista back when I came here in the 60s,” said I.V.

Lodise is also the author of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s wonderful.

At the time, however, we were so keen on the act of registering students to vote that it’s possible we overlooked the importance of the next step: strictly nonpartisan voter education,” Winnett said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know Campus Dems and College Republicans, as well as CALPIRG, helped out tremendously with distributing materials to the student body at large, and I’m thrilled that there will now be another outlet through which students can find reliable information.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has been a leader in student voter registration for decades because students have crafted a culture of civic engagement that is second to none,” Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited to see the passage of AB 963 because I see it as a step towards taking the model for voter registration that we have at UCSB statewide.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/","id":3512,"author":{"id":19,"name":"Alexandra Leal Silva"},"related":[3511,3510,3509],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gov.

Leyva, who authored the bill, said in a </span><a href=\"https://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-10-04-bill-ensuring-timely-pay-uc-workers-approved-governor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effective Jan. 1, 2020, the bill mandates that the UC pay its nearly 140,000 employees on their regularly scheduled payday, or be paid in accordance with university policy if paid on a more frequent basis, according to Tom Hintze, a graduate student at UC Davis and member of UAW 2865.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite payment complications resulting from UCPath issues in the past, the UC never faced any wage theft penalties because it is a public sector institution, which doesn’t require employers to pay fines for each payroll violation, Hintze said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees under the umbrella of UCPath looking to file a claim with the payroll system were often forced to wait an unknown sum of weeks, and in some cases, months, to get their paycheck, Hintze said. SB 698, however, allots a five-day period for the payroll system to pay employees in full. Otherwise, employers will be subject to legal action through the Private Attorneys General Act, which enables workers to sue “in order to recoup their wages.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara first implemented UCPath in Fall Quarter 2018, but experienced shortfalls similar to other universities in the UC system when the UC Student Association released a list of demands to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsa-releases-demands-to-uc-regarding-ucpath-implementation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide restitution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for student workers affected by the payroll system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hintze said he began working for UAW 2865 in spring 2018 but didn’t take notice of UCPath’s “major problems” until May of 2018, when the payroll system was implemented at UC Merced and UC Riverside. Six months later, UCPath migrated to UCSB and UC Los Angeles, where there was “somewhere near a thousand people” who either weren’t paid on time, weren’t paid the right amount or lost benefits in the process, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students, especially those who often rely on a consistent pay schedule, have been bruised by UCPath’s inconsistent pay periods. In one instance at UCSB, an employee had their car repossessed as a result of “not being paid on time,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Berkeley, three employees were greeted with eviction notices after missing two months’ worth of pay due to the payroll system’s inability to accommodate for a shift in pay periods, according to Hintze. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath is expected to continue rolling out through 2020 at other universities such as UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis. Hintze stressed the timeliness of SB 698, which he hopes will help prevent a “major disaster like last year” when payroll issues arose from UCPath’s integration at other universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath’s migration across the UC system also marks a shift in payroll infrastructure. Hintze acknowledged that payroll problems predated UCPath’s arrival but said they were significantly easier to dispute because those former payroll centers were the respective campuses. Now, the UC has shifted the entire payroll system solely to UC Riverside, but the checks themselves don’t come from there; instead, according to Hintze, checks are “cut” and distributed from out of state, making it even harder to navigate the payroll process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While SB 698 will not repair any payroll damage incurred before it became law, Hintze said the UAW was successful in settling with the university to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compensate every employee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> affected by UCPath’s payroll errors last February. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each worker who was affected was eligible for $150 for each paycheck that [UCPath] had affected. So, the university paid out over $162,000 to student workers in damages,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Without them, today would not have been a reality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill allocates $200,000 to each UC and CSU campus student health center to cover the costs of providing abortion medication, including “Facility and security upgrades,” “Costs associated with training staff in the provision of abortion by medication techniques” and “Staff cost reimbursement and clinical revenue offset while staff are in trainings.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An additional $200,000 each will be allocated to the UC and CSU systems to pay for “24-hour, backup medical support by telephone to patients who have obtained abortion by medication techniques at a public university student health center,” among other training and budgeting costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC student health centers currently provide students with access to comprehensive reproductive health services, and this new law will further access to medication abortion by providing these services on-site,” Sarah McBride, spokesperson for the UC said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McBride added that the system “is currently evaluating next steps and will implement the law accordingly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Montalvo-Telford ‘19, who lobbied for SB 24’s passing and was present this morning when Newsom signed the bill into law, said the passing of the law made her feel “safe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It can be very scary and stressful to know that your basic rights are always up for debate, especially what we’ve been seeing at the federal level, but right now I feel good and I feel safe because I know California is leading the fight for reproductive justice and my rights are upheld right now,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Montalvo-Telford served as president of Students Against Sexual Assault last year and worked with justCARE: Campus Action for Reproductive Equity, a statewide organization that advocates for abortion pills on college campuses, and UCSB’s Students for Reproductive Justice, to advocate for the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year political science major Philippa Villalobos, current director for Students for Reproductive Justice, said that in addition to the organization’s work on campus, which included phone banking and tabling, they made multiple trips to Sacramento and testified at Senate and Assembly meetings in support of the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villalobos denounced Brown’s decision to veto the initial bill, explaining that “even if it were five miles, as students, it’s really difficult to get off campus.” In addition to having to potentially miss class multiple times and depend on often unreliable public transportation, Villalobos added that off-campus clinics can often have long wait times as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Aside from the physical barriers and financial barriers, a big issue too is the lack of community and discussion about pregnancy on campus,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And so by bringing this onto campus, you’re offering students a safe way to access abortion and have a conversation and not feel so alone.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

community and those who are supporting it,” Leets said.  Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The list was first debuted last year, after Craig Leets, current director of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), was hired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Dr. Nathaniel Burke, who’s the coordinator of equity and inclusion for the Division of Student Affairs, wanted to do an Out List and mentioned that to me as I was interviewing for this position, actually, and one of the things they were looking for in a new director was someone who had done an Out List before,” said Leets, who managed an Out List at Portland State University for several years before he started at UCSB last fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the list is to create a “visual representation of the community and those who are supporting it,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In many ways, LGBTQ identities are invisible, right?” he said. “We can’t look at someone and know they are LGBTQ, and so LGBTQ people look around them on a campus and they don’t know who else is LGBTQ and don’t know who’s supportive or welcoming to LGBTQ people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing those folks publicly acknowledging themselves as LGBTQ or as supporters can be really powerful for a student to feel like they’re not the only LGBTQ in their class, in their department or on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this year’s list will be launched on Friday, Leets updates the list on a rolling basis even after the deadline for sign-ups passes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, 471 students, staff and faculty signed up for the 2018 Out List over the course of the year; as of Tuesday afternoon, the 2019 Out List was at 494 sign-ups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really excited that this early in the year … we’ve already exceeded that number from last year, but my hope is that we’ll get a few more and be able to get above 500 for when we release the list on Friday,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leets emphasized that the list is not meant to be an “all-encompassing” list of LGBTQ individuals on the campus, particularly since there are many people who cannot be out publicly, either for personal or professional reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Leets acknowledged that there was the potential that the list could be used for “nefarious” reasons, he also said that anyone who signed up for the list was reminded during the sign-up process that they weren’t obligated to include any information they didn’t feel comfortable being publicly available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s one of those things that it’s impactful for the people who need it, but for people who don’t, I’m not sure they know it exists,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephenson Brooks Whitestone, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Communication who was on the Out List last year, emphasized the importance of such a resource to combat the “the alienation and isolation that many queer students feel — from the families, from their classmates, even from childhood friends,” she said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Out List] is [a] tangible symbol of queer people living their lives openly and honestly,” Whitestone added. “The knowledge that queer people live, survive and thrive here at UCSB is both comforting and empowering.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whitestone said that no students have reached out to her specifically because she’s on the list, but said she still likes “having [her] name on the list, and in a sense, adding to the length of the list.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whitestone noted that visibility can be a “tricky issue in the queer community” due to pressure to come out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But no one should become visible if they do not feel safe — physically or emotionally — to do so. Safety comes first. Opportunities for safe “out” living will come later. There’s never any need to put oneself at risk,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Alan Fridlund in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who signed up for the Out List in 2018, said he discusses LGBTQ issues in class often, either in scientific or personal contexts, and discloses his own sexual orientation during these discussions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students have described relief at being able to talk freely with someone both familiar with the science and has also navigated a personal “coming out” journey,” Fridlund said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Movies and TV are making LGBT characters trendy, and the old stigmas about being LGBT are diminishing,” Fridlund added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are still a number of students who come from families that view being LGBTQ “as sin, moral defect or mental illness,” he noted. This is where the Out List can come into play, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For these students especially, some of whom may be conflicted about their own LGBT inclinations, it’s important to understand that LGBT people </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like their non-LGBT counterparts </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are just normal everyday folks.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Loop, which will include three music stages, a space for games and activities and a beer garden. </span><em>Britta Good / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an open-source transformational arts and music festival</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, first introduced the idea for a spring festival during Deltopia to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Tuesday’s meeting, I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt expressed the board’s sentiments that Deltopia in its current state, a fundamentally disorganized event that draws thousands of out-of-towners, creates a public safety concern for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595552000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQrErSI9EG7M_swcZiaWwgXZE0SA\">Deltopia 2019</a> saw 94 citations, 38 arrests, 19 medical transports and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-10/police-arrest-two-deltopia-visitors-on-armed-robbery-charges/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595548000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHa24jfKBR84l_Epw29OokNZ08eXw\">one serial robbery</a> — causing the month of April to have the highest number of arrests in comparison to previous months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Deltopia, as it exists, is not a safe environment. We see a spike in physical assaults, in sexual assaults. We see a spike in medical transports as a result of alcohol and drugs,” Brandt said at the meeting on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our board’s thought has always been to provide people with a fun alternative where the community has the ability to plan the event, plan the content of the event and have a better handle on what the security presence looks like that we can change the overall feel to be a much safer event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Proposal-V2-Includes-Budget-Site-Map-Security-Plan-IV-April-Event-2020-4.pdf\">current proposal</a> has the festival centered in the I.V. Loop, which will include three music stages, a space for games and activities and a beer garden featuring local breweries. The plan also includes detailed information regarding local community collaboration, security and the budget for the overall project, with expenses totalling $184,850.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire board unanimously expressed concern over the price tag of the event. According to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD, there are two main options to cover the cost of the event in the budget: a UCSB grant, or the $100,000 reserve allocation currently in the budget. UCSB can grant $93,000 under one condition — the university must reach an agreement with the I.V. CSD as to what the expenses are for. However, Director George Thurlow expressed doubts as to whether UCSB would be willing to fund a community festival versus placing the money directly into public safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ways to cover the cost of the festival could include sponsorships from local businesses and funding from the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD). Carlos Lopez, chairperson for the IVRPD, attended the meeting and said the IVRPD Board of Directors is willing to negotiate partially funding the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lopez also suggested a system of pre-registration for the festival where people could sign up online for a QR code that would grant them access to the event. A safety agreement and confirmation of residence in I.V. would accompany the QR code to deter outsiders from attending the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sara Marvel, a director for Lucidity, possible sources of revenue could also come from local sponsorships and the beer garden. Tickets could be sold for the beer garden, in the style of a beer tasting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity will also be foregoing the addition of food trucks to the festival — something they predicted would cause pushback from local businesses and go against their vision of a community-controlled event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marvel emphasized the Safety, Security and Harm Reduction Plan of the proposal to better respond to the annual problems Deltopia brings. It includes the Guardian Team, a security service “with focus on de-escalation, harm reduction, and crisis management,” <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardianteam.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595560000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1c8D18DVtMBpd6p5IRgQgFRpfKw\">according to its website</a>, as well as a large medical team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things we really pride ourselves on at Lucidity is we have a very, very well-staffed medical team on site. If anybody has any immediate emergency, we have the ability to support them right there and then,” Marvel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a proposal to end the event around 4 p.m. to funnel people toward UCSB’s campus event, The Warm Up, which typically begins at 6 p.m., Alan Avila, co-founder and head of security at Lucidity, said he is willing to negotiate to make the security and medical teams available until 10 p.m. or midnight should a situation arise where they are needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the festival’s budget still remains the primary concern for the directors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Have any of you electeds gone out in the community and said, ‘This is going to cost 180k of your utility user [tax], [and] you’re paying [for] it?’” Thurlow asked the board members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Ethan Bertrand echoed Thurlow’s thoughts and voiced his own concerns regarding the I.V. CSD’s ability to tackle the project as a newly formed entity and suggested approaching UCSB’s Associated Students for greater collaboration with the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am still a little bit concerned about the potential for this being a much bigger event during an already unsanctioned event,” Bertrand said. “I am definitely in support of scaling this down in any way that we can and aspiring to, in the next few years, put on this full event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, the next I.V. CSD meeting will have a more in-depth revision of the budget, as well as possible updates from negotiations with other organizations. With the festival plans requiring months of preparation, Abboud says the board will have to make a decision soon over whether or not to actually hold the festival, possibly by the last I.V. CSD meeting of October or the first meeting of November.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Once the volunteer arrived to the beach a few hours later, he confirmed to Rogers that the sea lion was suffering from domoic acid toxicosis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Domoic acid toxicosis starts at the bottom of the food chain, found among the phytoplankton called pseudo-nitzschia. Through biomagnification, the toxicity of this harmful algal bloom — a rapid growth of algae in a small area — becomes more concentrated in animals as it goes from krill to small fish and sardines to the California sea lion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The volunteer] was describing to me how it literally shrinks the size of the sea lion hippocampi … and for the rest of the hour I just listened to him off the edge of my seat with my mouth hanging open,” Rogers explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The way he was describing [the sea lion’s] mental state, he equated it to human dementia and was telling me she doesn’t know that she’s a sea lion and she doesn’t know where she is. She doesn’t know that she needs to hunt, she doesn’t know what fish are.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When CIMWI gets a call about domoic acid toxicosis in animals, a volunteer arrives at the scene to assess the animal, but they usually keep the animal in its immediate surroundings instead of relocating to the rehabilitation facility in order prevent further disorientation. The sea lion is left “in a safety perimeter” and volunteers regularly monitor the animal’s condition, according to signs CIMWI posted along I.V. beaches over the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While domoic acid toxicosis seriously impacts the affected sea lion’s health, acute effects dissipate after 72 hours as the toxin works its way through the animal’s body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effects of domoic acid go beyond sea lion health on the Central Coast. Mussels and other shellfish feed on pseudo-nitzschia, which is potentially deadly to humans if they eat affected mussels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we were to say, eat mussels that have been filtering and feeding on pseudo-nitzschia that happen to be toxic … we would pick up those toxins as well,” said Mark Brzezinski, professor of biological oceanography and director of the Marine Science Institute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s why when domoic acid levels are high, the shellfish harvesting is put on hold, because those could be poisonous.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While studies clearly indicate a rise in domoic acid due to climate and human-generated issues, there’s not a simple connection between a changing atmosphere and preventing outbreaks of domoic acid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Brzezinski explained, the pseudo-nitzschia phytoplankton does not always produce the toxin, so researchers find it nearly impossible to predict when and where algal blooms will be toxic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because it’s in the water doesn’t mean it’s producing the toxin </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that’s one of the frustrating things. We monitor the amounts of pseudo-nitzschia in the water every week; we take a sample on Monday, and by Tuesday we have the answer. But we also know that the relationship between the number of pseudo-nitzschia out there and toxicity is really poor. The numbers don’t predict toxicity. We can’t infer the toxic bloom just from the number of organisms out there, which is a little frustrating, but we have to be careful interpreting abundance data.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, the same species can be toxic one day and not the other. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not known in a well enough way that, ‘This group’s going to be toxic and that group over there’s not.’ We’re not at that point. It’s one of the areas that people who do this full time are really focused in on, to try and understand that, because it’s a major gap in our knowledge.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With any future sea lion sightings, CIMWI warns beachgoers to keep their distance even if the sea lion appears approachable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But from what Rogers witnessed on the beach, it will take a lot of diligence for students to keep their space from rare close encounters with marine wildlife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that we live in a very voyeuristic society, particularly with the rise of like heavy documentation of our lives and the things we see. I’d be remiss to say it wasn’t connected to social media,” Rogers said. “But I also do think there’s a kind of benign interest in natural phenomenon, like with a growing disconnect between us and the environment and I think that people are interested in kind of bridging that gap for themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rogers waited hours by the sea lion for CIMWI, telling students to keep their space. For her, the change from her daily routine was a reminder for her to remain active in the fight against climate change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had a moment of reckoning where I was on my second hour of waiting for CIMWI and I was kind of like, ‘Okay, this is taking a long time, I’m dedicating a lot of time to this.’ I was questioning myself, does my emotional response to these kinds of things hinder me or is it a strength? Because I was feeling very drained by the fact that I was watching the sea lion and I didn’t know her fate and I was having this reckoning with myself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just hope that students hear this call-to-arms and remain helpful in order to be productive and when they feel this emotional hole to notice and bear witness to what’s happening in the environment. I hope that students follow the path of action rather than the path of denial and paralyzation and don’t let themselves be overwhelmed by what’s happening, but instead let themselves be motivated and kind of be sparked to action and to making change.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

page </span></em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What most students don’t know, however, is that this post didn’t belong to a student at all — it belonged to a professor, seasoned with over a decade’s worth of experience in the art of memeing with enough practice to likely earn himself a degree in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The professor, Bob Kennedy — a linguistics lecturer at UCSB — first dipped his toes in the university’s meme scene years ago, when he began posting on a now-defunct Facebook group.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think your cohort is not aware of the fact that there was a different UCSB meme page around 2011, 2012 or so. It’s still up, but it’s fallen into disuse and nobody posts on it,” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I stopped checking because there was no activity on it. But then I think it was during Thomas Fire, one of my students mentioned to me, ‘Hey, Professor Kennedy, you’ve got to check out the [new] meme page because the memes people are making about the fire are hysterical,’” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to jokes of his own, Kennedy blends in well with the student-generated memes around him, posting pictures of slumped-over trees and punny captions to appease viewers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until recently, Kennedy says most of his activity on the “Zesty Meme Cuisine for Horny Teens” meme page has been spent “lurking,” or scrolling through the page without posting. But he actively posts on a linguistics meme page he maintains himself, which he said is chock-full of “really niche humor.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [linguistics] jokes are lost on just about everybody,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Kennedy said the jokes that don’t work serve to teach him about the ones that do. After teaching at UCSB for over 15 years, Kennedy has had ample time to hone his craft. He’ll opt to inject “a little bit of playful humor” while teaching a class, which oftentimes helps him make a point or lighten the mood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have humor in class, it’s either self-deprecating or it makes fun of people in power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But memes, on the other hand, serve a different purpose. Kennedy finds that the nature of memes — “a quick joke” — enables people to laugh at “content that everyone can get right away.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it doesn’t need to be explained, then people are gonna respond well,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s not to forget about the downsides of meme culture, such as the potential for a “destructive” or “nasty” message — which Kennedy said is generally the result of cracking a joke intended to be funny but ends up offensive in its delivery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Another thing that comes up, especially in the teaching context, is where we confront humor that’s hurtful. And so in some of my classes, I do this: I’ll say, ‘Look, here’s the point of view that someone had tried to make with a joke and it’s offensive and their defense is going to be, ‘Well, come on, I’m just trying to be funny,’” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s never an appropriate response to defend a joke that’s been hurtful to someone else,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid this, however, Kennedy suggests that anyone looking to crack a joke should bear in mind their own identity as to not “punch down” with their humor, or make a joke that pushes the boundaries on one’s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kennedy defines himself as a “straight, white middle-aged person,” which means “the only people I can tell jokes about are people who think they’re smarter than they are, people who are wealthy or people who are older than myself,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He made note of comedy’s magnitude in the academic world, some of which has spilled into classrooms at UCSB with Linguistics 135, a course dedicated to memes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have a colleague in my department who teaches a class on memes and it’s a deep dive into theories of what it is that people are tapping into when they make [memes],” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s scholars who study the structure of humor and joke templates and everything else like that. And the nature of how humor plays a role in conversational interactions,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a linguist by trade, Kennedy said he uses comedy to not only make students laugh, but to also use memes’ shared “overlapping” sense of humor to better understand social practices used among college students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The student perspective] is valuable to me,” which opens doors to a culture that “people my age ought to be more aware of than pretend like we’re annoyed by it or anything else like that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time a funny meme floats across your screen — look twice — it may be your professor. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, the average employee wage was $29,815, a number drawn from over 17,000 employee salaries at the university.
