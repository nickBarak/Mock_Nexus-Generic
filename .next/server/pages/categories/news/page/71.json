IVRPD will repeat the process to re-pipe the parks for the recycled water.</p>\n<p>IVRPD began gathering funds for the project when Measure O <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-09/measure-o-passes-will-fund-i-v-park-services/\">passed</a> in May 2017. The local ballot measure implemented a new property tax that adds an estimated $256,358 to the district’s annual <a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/budgets/17-18%20Approved%20Final%20Budget%20Formatted.pdf\">budget</a>.</p>\n<p>Gould said he is “hopeful” the district can begin construction in the latter half of 2018, but said a start date in spring 2019 is “more realistic.”</p>\n<p>Gould also said bringing in recycled water would help increase irrigation in I.V. parks, such as Greek Park and Pardall Gardens, without negatively impacting the region’s drinking water supply.</p>\n<p>David Matson, assistant general manager of the Goleta Water District (GWD), said recycled water benefits both the local community and the environment.</p>\n<p>“Using recycled water for irrigation directly offsets the use of drinking water, thus preserving it for the community,” Matson said in an email.</p>\n<p>In addition, irrigation with locally recycled water saves energy by reducing demand for imported water from other areas, Matson said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD’s recycled water project will add to recycled irrigation that already exists in the area.</p>\n<p>According to Matson, more than 90 percent of UC Santa Barbara’s irrigation involves the use of recycled water.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD Board of Directors approved recycled-water irrigation in its parks during an Oct. 12 board meeting.</p>\n<p>The Board was concerned that the recycled water would be too expensive, but decided to move forward believing the project to be safe enough to proceed with.</p>\n<p>The reclaimed water project would involve the installation of a purple pipe to supply water to the parks’ irrigation systems; a purple pipe is specifically designated for carrying reclaimed water.</p>\n<p>Recycled or reclaimed water is wastewater that has gone through a series of filtrations and treatments until it is clean enough to be reintegrated into the water supply in some form or another.</p>\n<p>According to Hugo Loaiciga, professor of geography and hydrology at UCSB, most of the reclaimed water in California is non-potable, or not safe for drinking.</p>\n<p>Non-potable recycled water is used to irrigate landscapes and plants not intended for eating. IVRPD would integrate non-potable reclaimed water into its irrigation system.</p>\n<p>Loaiciga said the process of reclaiming non-potable water begins with filtering raw sewage to remove large solids. Coagulants are added to condense smaller solids to aid removal of the material.</p>\n<p>Aerobic degradation breaks down organic matter, and a chlorinated substance helps further decontaminate the water. A final round of filtration and reverse osmosis make the water ready for non-potable use.</p>\n<p>“Our actions were guided by a sense of regional responsibility,” Gould said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>A

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisements began running on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pandora, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram on Oct. 10 and will remain on the sites until Oct. 31. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the advertisements are funded through unrestricted gift funds, which are donations from alumni. The <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">reported</a> in February that the university spent $30,000 on advertisements for Halloween weekend last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisements are one of the ways the university has tried to curb attendance during party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada said the campus-wide efforts build on the student-based “keep it local” initiative, a campaign that runs television and radio advertisements throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs sends letters to college students throughout California that outline regulations that could impact students if they choose to attend Halloween in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university also sends letters to local junior high and high schools urging students to not celebrate Halloween in I.V.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said the Office of Student Life met with representatives from Associated Students and UC Isla Vista in the beginning of Fall Quarter to share the content of the advertisements and receive feedback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batsheva Stoll, external vice president of local affairs, said she appreciates the university’s efforts to decrease attendance in I.V. during Halloween weekend but said the advertisements are an expensive option and can provoke misunderstanding.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ads themselves can give I.V. a bad rap by making it seem like a scary hostile place when it’s our home and our community,” Stoll said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office (SBSO), the turnout for Halloween weekend has steadily decreased over the past three years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBSO estimated that “several hundred” people were in I.V. for Halloween weekend last year, Hoover said, a significant decrease from the 13,000 partygoers that visited I.V. in 2013. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) will have about 55 officers patrolling I.V. this weekend, said Sgt. Rob Romero, UCPD spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD will also source officers from four other University of California campuses to assist in patrolling, including officers from San Diego, Riverside, Irvine and San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoover said there will still be a strong law enforcement presence in I.V. this weekend, despite the decreased turnout in recent years. The SBSO does not release the number of officers assigned to an operation for safety reasons, Hoover said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been really pleased with what we’ve seen in the last couple of years, with students really having pride in their community and their school and wanting to keep Isla Vista safe,” Hoover said.</span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-79287\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Parking restrictions have been enforced for the past several years in response to a historically large out-of-towner presence in I.V. for party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p><strong>ISLA VISTA</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Associated Students’ (A.S.) Halloween website, street parking will be prohibited starting at 9 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 27, until 6 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 1, on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Del Playa Drive, the 6500 block of Trigo Road and between Del Playa Drive and Trigo Road on Camino Pescadero, Camino Del Sur and El Embarcadero Road.</p>\n<p>Cars parked on the 6500 block of El Nido Road and on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road do not need to be moved over this time period, but roadblocks will be placed on those blocks to prevent cars from entering and exiting.</p>\n<p><strong>UCSB</strong></p>\n<p>According to the A.S. Halloween website, visitors are not allowed to park on campus.</p>\n<p>Vehicles parked on campus without a matching permit are subject to a $300 citation and towing.</p>\n<p>Students with a Night &amp; Weekend (N&amp;W) Parking Permit will be able to park on campus from 11 a.m. on Friday to 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Lots 22, 18, 16, 30 and 38 will be the only lots open for parking over the weekend.</p>\n<p>N&amp;W permits purchased in the fall cost $52.50 plus a $5.95 shipping charge. Permits are sold year round, but students had to apply for a parking permit by Oct. 15 to have it shipped in time for the coming weekend. Each student may only purchase one permit.</p>\n<p>The only valid permits for overnight parking — between 5 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. — are special event permits, N&amp;W, Isla Vista Access permit for Lot 22 (IVA 22) or faculty and staff permits.</p>\n<p>IVA 22 is a valid permit for Lot 22.</p>\n<p>Only 100 of these permits were available for “community members, UCSB staff, faculty, and non-resident students,” according to the Associated Students’ Halloween tip website.</p>\n<p>Last year, Transportation &amp; Parking Services offered a 50 percent discount for the N&amp;W permits prior to the Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nestor Covarrubias, director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services, said they decided not to renew the discount this year because they believe the permit price is already fair.</p>\n<p>“The Night and Weekend parking permit is a good value, allowing access to campus for the entire academic year,” Covarrubias said in an email. “The equivalent cost to purchase daily passes for the Halloween period alone would come out to $32.”</p>\n<p>Transportation &amp; Parking Services has sold 354 N&amp;W permits this year. The department sold 465 permits by this time last year, Covarrubias said.</p>\n<p>According to Covarrubias, Transportation &amp; Parking Services issued 95 parking citations between Oct. 28 and Oct. 30 last year. He said 94 of the citations were issued at $48, and one was issued at $238 because the vehicle was parked in front of a fire hydrant.</p>\n<p><strong>GOLETA</strong></p>\n<p>According to Valerie Kushnerov, community relations manager for the City of Goleta, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Friday through Sunday, street parking will be limited to residents with parking permits for the weekend. Two such parking permits were sent to each Goleta household in preparation.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 26, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

university’s Slavic studies, geology and military science librarian. In addition to her duties as a librarian, she studies vexillology, the study of flags and their historical and symbolic significance.</p>\n<p>Platoff’s interest in flags began as a childhood obsession. As a young girl, she recalled collecting flag patches and recruiting friends and family to help her gather them.</p>\n<p>Today, she has a collection of over 3,000 flags and is the leading North American expert on National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) flags and regional flags of Russia and the former Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>Platoff says flags are very symbolic and emotion-filled objects that can represent different ideals for different groups. She said an understanding of the connection between emotions and politics could help people understand the take-a-knee movement.</p>\n<p>“To some people, the take-a-knee movement is about the flag,” she said. “There is so much emotion tied up in them that people read them different ways depending on their personal background and history.”</p>\n<p>The take-a-knee movement began when 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick remained sitting during the National Anthem at a football game in August 2016, which since then sparked different football players to kneel during the anthem.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t understand the perspective of African Americans … or perhaps other groups that do not enjoy equal treatment under the law, you would see it as an affront to the flag,” Platoff said. “But if you look from their perspective, you can understand why the take-a-knee movement has taken off.”</p>\n<p>Platoff believes she has the best flag collection in North American relating to NASA, as well as flags made in Russia or the Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>Through her vexillology research, Platoff has found connections between the United States and Russia through both countries’ experiences with nationalist groups. She says flags are oftentimes controversial symbols because they can be interpreted differently depending on an individual’s personal history.</p>\n<p>Platoff said a new nationalist group in Ukraine uses the flag of the old Ukrainian Insurgent Army, a former nationalist group from World War II which fought both with and against the Nazis, as the symbolic representation of their group. Ukraine has a mix of Ukrainian and Russian culture.</p>\n<p>“When a Ukrainian sees this flag, they see it as a Ukrainian national symbol,” she said. “But when a Russian sees that flag, they think it’s a fascist symbol.”</p>\n<p>She compares this situation with the United States’ struggle surrounding the Confederate flag in the United States.</p>\n<p>“When you see the Confederate flag you may think it’s a racist symbol, but someone from the South will see it as a symbol of their Southern heritage,” Platoff said.</p>\n<p>Platoff developed her flag expertise when she worked as a librarian at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where she became interested in different NASA flags. Within her current collection, Platoff has flags that have flown on Gemini and Apollo space missions.</p>\n<p>Platoff’s work with NASA’s flags also extends past her collection, as she wrote the official NASA history of the flag used in the Apollo XI mission, as well as a paper for the University of California negating moon landing conspiracies.</p>\n<p>She explained that conspiracy theorists were examining the wrinkles of a flag on the moon, which appeared to be blowing in the wind — impossible in a place with zero gravity. She refuted their claims by noting that the flag was created with two rods running perpendicular to the vertical pole, allowing for the illusion of movement.</p>\n<p>Platoff has also held many positions within North American Vexillological Association (NAVA), serving as the first and second vice president, and is now the director of NAVA’s digital library.</p>\n<p>Platoff says she is most proud of the publication of her first published work on flags in NASA, “Where No Flag Has Gone Before: Political and Technical Aspects of Placing a Flag on the Moon.” The paper won the prestigious Captain William Driver Award, which is presented at NAVA’s annual conference.</p>\n<p>“No one had really written anything about the political aspects in deciding to put a flag on the moon and the technical engineering problems associated with it,” she said. “This was the first work to sort of look at those together.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Platoff believes she has the best NASA, Russian and Soviet Union flag collection in North America, not the best North American flag collection.  </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 26, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

What the hell are we doing?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Joe Biden was the vice president under the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2017 and has played a vocal role opposing the Trump Administration since his departure from office.</p>\n<p>Biden encouraged students to remain hopeful about politics, even if they believe the current national climate is broken “beyond repair.”</p>\n<p>“The reason I’m so excited about the millennials is because you reached the same place my generation did in the mid-sixties,” he said. “There’s no damn reason your generation can’t [face what’s ahead].”</p>\n<p>The United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War and the turmoil of the Civil Rights Movement throughout the 1960’s provoked protests and riots throughout the nation and on college campuses, including student anti-war protests at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Biden spoke passionately about the recent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia and reminded the crowd that Americans must bring moral values back into the political system and reject the “phony nationalism” of white supremacists.</p>\n<p>He also criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the protests in Charlottesville.</p>\n<p>“The silence was deafening.

Biden and Bhavnani discussed gun control, race relations in the U.S. and Biden’s son Beau’s battle with brain cancer.</p>\n<p>Though he often became visibly uncomfortable and withdrawn, Biden spoke with eloquence of his great personal tragedies.

Most recycled water is non-potable, or unsafe for drinking. Non-potable water is used primarily for irrigation of plants not intended for consumption.</p>\n<p>The project will install “purple pipes,” a type of pipe that carries recycled water in an environmentally-conscious way. The project will stretch from Embarcadero Del Norte south to People’s Park, Perfect Park, Little Acorn Park and the nearby areas.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, the newly appointed IVRPD director, made the motion to authorize staff to work on the project at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock, a fourth-year sociology and economics double major, told the <em>Nexus</em> last Thursday that one of his goals as a director would be to install the infrastructure needed to provide recycled water.</p>\n<p>The recycled water project is a step toward fulfilling the promises IVRPD board members made when campaigning for “yes” on Measure O.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/budgets/17-18%20Approved%20Final%20Budget%20Formatted.pdf\">According to its budget</a>, the IVRPD estimates it will receive $256,358 in tax revenue because the measure passed in May.</p>\n<p>The parks district said earlier this year it would use the funds to address a “backlog of deferred maintenance” in its parks as well as bring reclaimed water to I.V.</p>\n<p>“Every single one of us has knocked on the door and said this is a thing we’ve wanted to do,” IVRPD Director Carlos López said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/board-agenda/agenda/2017/BrdAgenda%20October%2012%202017.pdf\">According to IVRPD’s Oct. 12 agenda</a>, the parks district asked the Goleta Water District if it would be interested in entering an agreement to provide stable water rates if the district chose to install purple pipes in the park.</p>\n<p>The water district said in an attachment to last week’s meeting agenda that the rates are determined by studies and that any agreement must comply with the current water rate, though reclaimed water cannot be charged at a higher rate than the cost for providing it.</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said investing in this type of water comes with risks because the rates could change at any moment or the water district could choose to stop offering recycled water.</p>\n<p>He reassured board members that the idea was likely “safe enough, but that there is no guarantee the rates will not change or that water will continue to be offered. Board members agreed and authorized the decision through a unanimous vote.</p>\n<p>At their meeting, the IVRPD also moved forward with a number of park improvement projects, including a new irrigation project for Sueno Park’s orchards and installing power to People’s Park to host bands and festivals.</p>\n<p>According to the board’s agenda, the project to bring irrigation to Sueno Park will cost approximately $5,700<strong>. </strong>Diane Dodds, a UC Santa Barbara alumnus, donated $2,000 to the project’s completion.</p>\n<p>The board also approved the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) to use their parks to host the newly-expanded Community Service Escort program. The service district’s board of directors voted to expand the program to increase safety in I.V. in September.</p>\n<p>The CSD will work with CSOs by setting up tents near highly-frequented areas on weekends so community service officers may provide escorts to anybody who requests service.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD board of directors meets every second Thursday of the month from 6 to 8 p.m. in the IVRPD building next to the I.V.

The two parties began discussions to settle the lawsuit at the end of July. He ultimately filed to dismiss the lawsuit on Oct. 13, and the court accepted the dismissal on Oct. 16, according to the Santa Barbara County online court record database.</p>\n<p>In the lawsuit, Pragin alleges that the CSD’s Formation Committee discussed financial revenue, such as grants and donations, when it was only authorized to discuss the CSD’s financial structure, such as banking.</p>\n<p>A charter is a document listing what a committee may discuss during its meetings.</p>\n<p>Pragin said he set three conditions for dismissing the lawsuit during the negotiation process.</p>\n<p>The first is that the scope of the Formation Committee’s work be defined more clearly in its charter. According to the CSD’s lawyer G. Ross Trindle, the CSD addressed this concern by signing Resolution 17-1 on July 11 with a unanimous vote of the board.</p>\n<p>The resolution outlines the CSD subcommittees’ roles, including the Formation Committee.</p>\n<p>The resolution added the ability to find sources for funding to the committee’s powers.</p>\n<p>“That resolution, in my mind, addressed the … concerns that Mr. Pragin’s complaint attempted to raise,” Trindle said in an email.</p>\n<p>The second condition Pragin requested when dismissing the lawsuit is a statement from the board recognizing that they violated the Formation Committee’s initial charter.</p>\n<p>Trindle said the CSD plans to make a statement on the lawsuit at the next regularly scheduled board meeting on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>Pragin’s last request before dismissing the case was to recuperate the costs he suffered from the litigation.</p>\n<p>He said he spent approximately $1,200 pursuing the lawsuit against the district.</p>\n<p>Pragin dismissed the cases without receiving compensation; he lost eligibility to have his costs reimbursed when he decided to represent himself in the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>According to federal law, if a person representing themselves in court is not a lawyer they are unable to be awarded attorney’s fees if they win their case.</p>\n<p>Pragin told the <em>Nexus</em> he attempted to address the alleged violations at the Formation Committee’s public meeting but said all the committee members agreed he was incorrect in his claims against the district.</p>\n<p>He said he felt the committee did not take his claims seriously.</p>\n<p>“I stopped feeling like a constituent of theirs,” he said.</p>\n<p>Trindle said in an email he thought it was “unfortunate” that Pragin felt his only option was filing a lawsuit but said it is important that the district can now focus on improving I.V. for its residents.</p>\n<p>CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday evening that he and the other board members are committed to the importance of transparency and public participation.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman recused himself from all closed sessions discussing the lawsuit to avoid a possible conflict of interest stemming from his long-term friendship. Pragin also served as Freeman’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-14/three-final-candidates-join-race-for-office-in-isla-vista/\">“campaign philosopher”</a> for the 2016 Santa Barbara County Supervisor race.</p>\n<p>In addition to the lawsuit, Pragin said he has also served the district and its subcommittees with three letters citing violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act, the law that sets the rules for open meetings of government boards and the communications between board members.</p>\n<p>According to Pragin, two of the complaints were answered and corrected and one was answered and disputed.</p>\n<p>Two of the alleged violations were served in April and the other in May.</p>\n<p>One of his letters dated April 20 claimed the CSD illegally created an ad hoc committee by making a committee that discussed “continuing subject matter jurisdiction,” arguing that the contents the committee discussed made it ineligible to be ad hoc.</p>\n<p>Bertrand responded in a letter a month later saying the board rescinded the action that first created the ad hoc committee and passed a new motion that created it once more with a more fitting description of its powers.</p>\n<p>The second letter, also dated April 20, alleged directors George Thurlow and Bob Geis had a side conversation during a regular board meeting of the CSD to plan their next meeting of the Formation Committee.</p>\n<p>Geis, chair of the Formation Committee, disputed the claim in a letter stating the committee did not believe the action warranted a commitment to cease and desist and that such an action would lead to a “burdensome limitation.”</p>\n<p>The letter dated May 9 claimed members of the Formation Committee failed to publicly notice, adjourn or show up to a public meeting.</p>\n<p>Geis responded in a letter a week later stating the committee “unconditionally commits” to ceasing, desisting and refusing to repeat the offense Pragin stated in his letter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">“No es fácil andar en la calle [It’s not easy being on the streets],” says Hijinio Camacho.<em> Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Since the first week of classes, however, the university has prohibited Camacho and other off-campus vendors from selling on campus with student organizations.</p>\n<p>According to the Office of Student Life (OSL), the vendors’ sales violate the Environmental Health and Safety policies regarding food vendors unaffiliated with the university. OSL is only allowed to grant permits to campus organizations, not the companies and vendors who work with them.</p>\n<p>For the past two years, off-campus vendors have been allowed to sell products alongside student organizations with permits granted by OSL.</p>\n<p>According to Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, the office wasn’t fully aware the vendors were violating university policies until a meeting on Sept. 25 with the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Pienso quedarme aquí porque aquí es donde yo he visto que los estudiantes te tratan como tal y como tú eres y no te distinguen porque no seas una persona educada, porque no seas una persona civilizada.”</p>\n<p>— Hijinio Camacho</p></blockquote>\n<p>Camacho said he was notified about the policy reinforcements two days before school started. He then met with OSL on the first day of school to understand why he was no longer permitted to work with student organizations on campus.</p>\n<p>His first event of the school year was a fundraiser with the UCSB Promise Scholars.</p>\n<p>Camacho had planned events with Seoul’d Out, Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), <em>Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion, y Revolucion</em>, (M.U.J.E.R.) and the Latino Business Association. He started working with student organizations about two years ago and has held fundraisers with groups such as <em>Hermanas Unidas</em>, <em>Raices de Mi Tierra</em>, Alpha Phi Omega and Lambda Theta Alpha.</p>\n<p>Every school day of this year was booked for an event, Camacho said. Student organizations would typically keep 15 percent of the profit from the shared fundraisers.</p>\n<p>OSL, UCSB Concessions and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety are currently creating “more inclusive policies” that will lift the current restrictions surrounding off-campus vendors and allow vendors like Camacho to continue to work with student organizations.</p>\n<p>“We really want to figure out how to add [off-campus vendor permits] to the sorts of permits we are able to approve…both because it’s a good fundraising mechanism for them but also it has been a positive contribution to our campus,” Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>Camacho met with OSL on Tuesday and told the <em>Nexus</em> he now needs two more permits from the university to work with student organizations. The two permits will allow him to sell on campus either once a week or once a month.</p>\n<p>Ashlock said the sudden policy revision further contributed to the frustration and confusion felt by both the students and the vendors because some vendors, like Camacho, already had events planned with student groups.</p>\n<p>“I have been been really clear with every conversation with my colleagues on how important it is that we figure this out, that we figure it out quickly, but also give good and clear advice,” Ashlock said. “That’s why it’s taking a little longer.”</p>\n<p>Camacho, who hails from Puebla, Mexico, has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. He spent time in I.V. during the early years of his time in the U.S. but found little success due to the demographic at the time.</p>\n<p>“When I arrived [in I.V.]… two years after arriving to this country, at that time there was mainly Asians and white people. It was 10 percent Latino,” Camacho said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79154\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"764019501\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79193\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79154\" data-attachment-id=\"79154\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/img_1111/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elote Hijinio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79154 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79154\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Camacho has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. <em>Anthony Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Upon his return to Isla Vista two years ago, however, Camacho noticed more students of Latino descent at UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB was categorized as a Hispanic Serving Institute by the Association of Colleges and Universities in 2015 and has a 28 percent Chicano/Latino population, according to the 2016-2017 campus profile published by the Office of Budget and Planning.</p>\n<p>The rise in street food popularity over the years has opened the gates to members outside of the Latino community to indulge in Mexican snacks found on push-carts like Camacho’s.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been looking for you for two years!” exclaimed Jacqueline Liu, a third-year global studies and psychology double major, as she approached Camacho’s cart last week. Liu said she remembers living in a Mexican community as a child and taking money from her mother’s purse so she and her brother could buy snacks from their local elotero.</p>\n<p>With a large and increasing fan club comes busy schedules, as Camacho’s days often begin at 3 a.m. when he needs to pick up merchandise, ending at sundown when his day of selling is over.</p>\n<p>On other days, he arrives in I.V. at around 3 p.m. and begins his route on Picasso Road at Children’s Park, making his way down Embarcadero del Norte and down Pardall Road, with a stop in front of Freebirds along the way. From there he goes to Abrego Road and circles back onto Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>Camacho also created a Venmo account two years ago that allowed customers to buy from him without using cash. He has also made a Snapchat account with a Bitmoji character so customers can now locate him when he is in I.V.

Anthony<em> Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Precious Slut Tattoo, a local piercing and tattoo parlor, has long grabbed the community’s attention with its risqué name. Now, students have five more reasons to flock to the shop.</p>\n<p>Stormy, Jacob, Tucker, Buster Brown and Maisy have become an integral part of the Isla Vista community through their eagerness and friendly nature.</p>\n<p>Tracy Holt, who opened Precious Slut Tattoo 12 years ago, said his dogs are a form of support for Isla Vistans and visitors on both good and bad days.</p>\n<p>“Whether it’s finals, boyfriends, girlfriends just broke up with you, parents kicking them out of school, wrecked the car, DUI,” Holt said. “Everyone in Isla Vista seems to know those dogs; a lot of people know them by name.”</p>\n<p>Holt said he has owned dogs for his whole life and once owned 11 dogs at the same time. He said the “unmeasured” companionship is unlike any other.</p>\n<p>“There’s just no greater form of friendship,” Holt said. “It’s unsolicited.”</p>\n<p>While all of the dogs have been raised under the same roof, they’ve each developed distinct personalities.</p>\n<p>Stormy, one of the American Pit Bull Terriers, is seven years old and has established herself as the alpha dog of the pack. She is strong and protective but loving, and she insists on sitting at the kitchen table for dinner each night.</p>\n<p>Jacob, the six-year-old “chicken” and second pit bull, gets creative when it comes to stealing more time with Holt.</p>\n<p>“Jake sits on my shoes in the morning ’cause he knows I need them to leave,” Holt laughed.</p>\n<p>Holt said he is not supposed to have a favorite, but has a special attachment to Tucker, a two-year-old French Bulldog. The codependent Tucker follows Holt around everywhere he goes.</p>\n<p>Maisy is a one-and-a-half-year-old French Bulldog who enjoys fighting sprinklers in her free time.</p>\n<p>Buster Brown, the 10-month-old French Bulldog and baby of the group, is always ready for a chase, even if it means running into the street during a <em>Nexus</em> interview.</p>\n<p>Despite their varying ages and unique traits, Holt said all the dogs are protective and ready to defend anyone in need, even against Holt himself.</p>\n<p>“I’ve raised those dogs to protect anyone,” Holt said proudly, comparing it to raising children.</p>\n<p>“If you raise that animal to be shitty to other people … then I don’t feel that that dog is going to defend you,” he said. “You’ve allowed that to happen.”</p>\n<p>Owners should be especially mindful in raising muscular dogs like pit bulls because they have a greater potential for defense than smaller dogs, Holt said.</p>\n<p>“The only problem with the scenario of a pit bull is he’s genetically built and designed to be that star kind of athlete,” he said. “He just … is more capable of defending.”</p>\n<p>Several years ago, Holt’s dog of 14 years died. He didn’t know if he would get another.</p>\n<p>“There was such a vacancy in my life, a lack of protection, a lack of ability to hear what was going on outside my house,” he said. “I never noticed that void in my whole life … and then I just realized how vulnerable I felt without it.”</p>\n<p>Holt had trouble putting into words the positive impact that his pups have had on his life.</p>\n<p>“The thing that I feel like so many people are looking for in the world and don’t know where to find it … I feel like I’ve done all of that in this little mini group of mine,” he said.</p>\n<p>Holt owns two other Precious Slut Tattoo shops in Nevada in addition to the Isla Vista location.</p>\n<p>One of the shops is located in Las Vegas, where 58 people died in a mass shooting on Oct. 1, 2017.</p>\n<p>Holt, recalling the devastation in Isla Vista after the events of May 23, 2014, said the dogs have acted as a source of comfort for both communities in mourning.</p>\n<p>“If I could only say anything, it’s how at the end of the day no matter how shitty life is, no matter how bad this big mass shooting thing in Vegas… People come here and they pet these dogs, and you see it make a difference in people’s lives,” Holt said.</p>\n<p>Stormy, Jacob, Tucker,  Buster Brown and Maisy have been around to see several UCSB graduating classes come and go, and alumni remember them when they come back to visit.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Each campaign lasts two years. As a result, each year typically sees one returning campaign and one newly elected one.</p>\n<p>This year, however, UCSA will support three campaigns due to a tie in votes between UCSOS and reIGNITE, UC Santa Barbara representative on the UCSA Board of Directors Kristin Hsu said. These campaigns were selected by the UCSA Board of Directors, which is composed of student representatives from the different UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“By selecting them as UCSA campaigns, UC students are committed to increasing awareness and seeking solutions that can address these issues,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>We Are 3D, the newly-elected campaign, will advocate for an increase in resource allocation for disabled, chronically ill and neurodivergent UC students. The campaign is currently advocating for a free 24-hour transportation service, increased accessibility to classrooms and health insurance for pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p>The UCSOS campaign will address the widespread food and housing insecurity prevalent amongst UC students. The campaign organizers are currently attempting to coordinate a UC hunger and homelessness week and hope to establish a standard of living for students at a UCSA meeting with UC President Janet Napolitano in two weeks.</p>\n<p>reIGNITE focuses on the same issues addressed by the 2013-2015 I.G.N.I.T.E. campaign, which discussed the school-to-prison pipeline, issues of diversity on UC campuses and UC campus climate.</p>\n<p>According to Nushi Yapabandara, a fourth-year philosophy major and reIGNITE cofounder and campaign coordinator at UCSB, a total of $6,000 from UC student fees is allocated for the campaigns, though the funds are not necessarily distributed evenly among the three campaigns.</p>\n<p>This is the UCSOS campaign’s last year, while UCSA is solidifying reIGNITE as a permanent campaign renamed as permIGNITE.</p>\n<p>“Many of the system-wide issues that students organize around cannot be fixed in one to two years but it is extremely important that we do what we can with the time we have,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she worked to bring a resolution to UCSA asking to make permIGNITE a permanent campaign to carry out the campaign’s long-term goals.</p>\n<p>Daniel Nagey, UC Davis’s undergraduate representative for the UCSA Board of Directors, explained that the reIGNITE campaign plans to work towards affirmative action, establishing a UC-wide UC Police Department oversight committee and a student bill of rights at a university-wide level.</p>\n<p>The board also plans to engage in local, low-income community outreach, recruitment retention spaces and prison divestment awareness.</p>\n<p>Nagey said the two UCSA campaigns had “pretty low” success rates last year, which he attributes to the November elections. He said he believes last year’s political climate made UC student governments and the UCSA board feel hopeless, but said he was optimistic for this year’s campaigns.</p>\n<p>“This situation obviously still is bad, but the shock is not there,” Nagey said.  “I’m hoping that we can push through and get these demands met within the year.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Nushi Yapabandara is a fourth-year philosophy major, not a third-year, as previously reported. </em></p>\n<p><em>The article was also corrected to show that the reIGNITE campaign is already a permanent campaign. Yapabandara worked to bring a resolution to UCSA to make permIGNITE a permanent campaign. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 12, 2017, print edition of

to families and children<strong>,</strong> the Isla Vista Youth Projects executive director will be retiring on Jan. 31, 2018. She will be leaving behind a legacy of improving the low-cost childcare services available to families in I.V.</p>\n<p>IVYP is a nonprofit organization that offers childcare and family education services in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am fortunate in that my job is the perfect intersection of my passion, skillsets, faith, and calling,” Miller said. “I recognize how rare it is that I get up every day and love to go to work.”</p>\n<p>Miller has worked at the organization for so long because she believes every child should have the opportunity to access schooling regardless of socioeconomic status, residence or skin color.</p>\n<p>“I am lucky enough to work with the cutest kids in the world in such a supportive community,” she said.</p>\n<p>Originally hired as the I.V. preschool principal, Miller was promoted to executive director after one year and has held the position since 1986. She said she was originally terrified to accept the position.</p>\n<p>Over the course of her career, Miller has seen IVYP expand from a single classroom to a multi-site, multi-program agency throughout the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>Miller’s proudest accomplishment is the national accreditation of the Children’s Center. The accreditation is particularly meaningful to her because the standards for approval are very high.</p>\n<p>Through her work with IVYP, Miller has seen many generations of families pass through the Children’s Center. Individuals that participated in the program as children have grown and returned to volunteer as adults and eventually enroll their own children, she says.</p>\n<p>She has many success stories with the children she works with, recalling that a young woman who enrolled in IVYP as a child graduated from UC Berkeley this past June. This, she says, is her favorite story because she is able to see the participants develop from infancy to college graduates.</p>\n<p>“This place gives our community the opportunity to know that a first-generation student going to college is very possible,” she said proudly.</p>\n<p>The facility on Phelps Road is equipped to serve children from the age of two to three months to preschool students. With 35 staff members and seven different classrooms, Miller has been instrumental in upgrading the facility during her time as director.</p>\n<p>The organization now has four facilities, including the Children’s Center on Phelps Road where many volunteers from UC Santa Barbara can gain teaching and childcare experience.</p>\n<p>“From holding babies, to one-on-one lessons with elementary-age children, IVYP had over 300 UCSB student volunteers this past school year for a total of over 600 volunteer hours,” Miller explained.</p>\n<p>As Miller’s time at IVYP comes to a close, she says her last project will be the creation of additional space for nine infants at the Children’s Center on UCSB’s West Campus.</p>\n<p>The project will cost approximately $20,000, and Miller said she hopes the community can collectively raise the funds. The Santa Barbara Foundation, a local philanthropic organization, has awarded IVYP $10,000 for the project.</p>\n<p>Miller said she is now eager to transition to a new period in her life. Though she will continue to do some consulting work for IVYP, she is looking forward to having more free time to spend with her family.</p>\n<p>“Life is precious, and I am now ready to relax after a great, long career,” she said.</p>\n<p>Miller will miss seeing the children each day but said she has faith in IVYP and believes it is organized by a “perfect group.”</p>\n<p>“It has always stayed true to its mission to serve I.V. and to stay in tune with what I.V. needs,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79093\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79093\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/","id":3644,"author":{"id":245,"name":"Miranda O'Brien"},"related":[3643,3642,3641],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":71,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
