May 2, 12:45 a.m. —</em> Officers were patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive when they noticed an especially rude young man yelling at passersby.</p>\n<p>“Fuckin’ Santa Barbara fool, what!” screamed the 20-year-old man. When a fellow reveler shot back a response, the intoxicated man yelled back, “Fuck you, fool!”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista’s finest wasn’t taking it, however, and took the pugnacious punk by the arm. He responded by saying, “Santa Barbara, born and raised, what!”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara local said that charges of him challenging others were “bullshit” and told officers, “I don’t give a fuck what you all think.” When asked how much alcohol he had consumed, he responded, “A few.”</p>\n<p>Because the rowdy SB rep was both intoxicated and challenging others, deputies arrested him and took him in to the station. On the way, the belligerent brawler apologized and confessed, “I deserved to be arrested; I admit, I was actin’ like a fool.”</p>\n<p>The deputies accepted the apology but nonetheless transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><strong>Is that a laptop in your pants or are you just happy to see me?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sun. May 2, 2:06 a.m. —</em> Deputies responding to a fight near the corner of Camino del Sur and Del Playa Drive were flagged down by Highway Patrol officers, who said they had detained a man in possession of stolen property.</p>\n<p>The subject — a 17-year-old male from Santa Barbara — was sitting on the ground with a gray Apple MacBook visibly poking out of the top of his pants.</p>\n<p>The clearly intoxicated juvenile said that he did not know where the computer came from and that a stranger had stuffed it down there. When cops handcuffed him and removed the stolen item, he shouted, “I think that’s Erin’s laptop.” Deputies asked him to go get Erin. He agreed, but came back to report that it, in fact, did not belong to Erin.</p>\n<p>During the remainder of their time with the feisty thief, officers had to hold him down to prevent him from biting or spitting on them.</p>\n<p>The young man was arrested for public intoxication and possession of stolen property and transported to Santa Barbara County Juvenile Hall, where he was housed, pending a beating from mommy.</p>\n<p><strong>“I want to be a part of it — New York, New York!”</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sat. May 1, 2:20 a.m. —</em> While on a routine patrol, officers spotted a group of people gathered around an intoxicated female on the 6500 block of Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>The group said that they didn’t know the wandering drunk, but had decided to help the sloppy single lady when they saw her staggering alone through the streets.</p>\n<p>When the officer asked what her name was, the 22-year-old said, “It doesn’t matter.” She proudly told the deputy that she was from New York, but also had a local address. Hoping not to arrest her, the cops asked if she could call a roommate to assist her home.</p>\n<p>That was not the question she wanted to hear, however, and the nostalgic New Yorker told them that she “hated” her roommates, “America,” and “this town.” She then shared that she desired nothing more than to return to Brooklyn.</p>\n<p>Officers said they were happy to give her a ride, but Brooklyn was just too far. Instead, the deputies transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22190\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22190\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/","id":3837,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3836,3835,3834],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Legislative Council meeting, members approved the Human Rights Board as an A.S. committee by a 20-1 vote. Following Arreola’s decision, the council, which can override a veto by a two-thirds vote, will address the matter at its meeting tonight.</p>\n<p>In his statement, Arreola called into question several of the bill’s elements, noting problems with its financial and organizational plans. The bill states that the new board will have a projected $0 fiscal impact for A.S. The HRB, however, calls for a Treasurer, Event Coordinator, Freshmen First-Year and Outreach Coordinator, as well as two Human Rights weeks per academic year, Arreola noted.</p>\n<p>“I do not see how any of these efforts will be possible without tapping into the Associated Students unallocated dollars,” Arreola wrote.</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President Chris Wendle, Arreola’s veto was a well thought-out decision.</p>\n<p>“I agree with his veto,” Wendle said. “…as the IVP looking at the structure of A.S., in my opinion there is evidence that shows that A.S. is expanding a little too fast… We need to appeal to what we have now; make our student government run a little more efficiently and understand exactly where our money is right now before we spend any more on new A.S. boards.”</p>\n<p>Arreola also listed other reasons for vetoing the HRB, including concerns about the vague nature of the group’s organizational structure, which calls for permanent directors from six non-A.S. groups and two A.S. groups. Another potential problem, Arreola wrote, is the HRB’s mission statement.</p>\n<p>“These set parameters allow for the proposed HRB to take stances on political issues, which we have seen Legislative Council struggle with in the past,” Arreola said. “By approving this bill, Legislative Council will be legitimizing a board that can potentially take a stance on political issues. This can potentially place the Associated Students in a compromising position by marginalizing the student body.”</p>\n<p>Nicolas Pascal, director of the UCSB Human Rights Council, said he was disappointed that Arreola did not share his concerns earlier.</p>\n<p>“I would have preferred that he would have worked with the Leg Council members who were working very seriously in the drafting of this bill,” Pascal said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/","id":3161,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[3160,3159,3158],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Did he think it was open?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Did he think it was open?</em></p>\n<p>Sun.

Legislative Council meeting, members approved the instatement of the HRC as an A.S. entity by a 20-1 vote. Arreola is expected to release a statement tomorrow regarding his veto of the creation of the A.S. Human Rights Board.</p>\n<p>Under the A.S. legal code, the President has the power to veto legislation passed by the Legislative Council if he or she does so within two business days of its adoption. In addition, the president is required to release a statement explaining the reasons for the veto within three business days of the legislation’s passage.</p>\n<p>Arreola did not return calls for comment as of press time.</p>\n<p>According to HRC Director Nicolas Pascal, Arreola’s decision to veto the bill surprised him.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been speaking with many member of the Human Rights Council, all of whom have expressed confusion and disappointment in Charlie Arreola’s seemingly bizarre decision,” Pascal said. “We haven’t yet received even one justification for his veto of an incredibly popular initiative that was passed with only one dissenting vote.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Chris Wendle, meanwhile, said he did not know the reasoning behind Arreola’s veto.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really know anything about it,” Wendle said. “I would really just wait for Charlie’s release because I don’t really know much about his decision.”</p>\n<p>As per the legal code, any legislation vetoed by the president will be automatically placed on the next week’s Legislative Council agenda. The council can override the veto by a two-thirds vote.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Jasmine Davenport, who authored the HRC bill, said the council has not yet taken a stance in response to the veto.</p>\n<p>“The Legislative Council is not really sure right now where we stand,” Davenport said. “Obviously I don’t agree with it because I was the author of the bill. I am willing to work with him and other leadership of A.S. to better the bill and better the board.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/","id":3128,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[3127,3126,3125],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Deputies responded to a call on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Rd. of someone throwing eggs off a balcony at nearby cars and passersby.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Humpty Dumpty<br>\nSun.

When the cops called out to the inebriated trio, one of the supporters nudged his friend in an effort to elicit a response but instead only caused him to fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>The officers called the paramedics before noticing the smell of alcohol wafting around a 19-year-old resident of the San Miguel Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>When a group of seven males emerged from a nearby frat house to watch the scene, the beer-soaked freshman called out, “Yeah, it’s none of your business, fuck you! Why don’t you go back inside!”</p>\n<p>The freshman and the frat boys began to exchange some heated words. The officer then told the drunken teenager he had two options — leave immediately or face arrest. Apparently looking for a fight, the first-year responded to the request by pushing the officer in the chest and shouting, “Don’t fucking touch me!”</p>\n<p>“Fuck you! Come on, do you want to go?” he asked the officer. And go they did. The deputy told the man that he was under arrest before wrestling him to the ground and handcuffing him.</p>\n<p>After hearing his Miranda rights, the forgetful freshie explained he did nothing wrong and denied any aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>In response to his arrest, he noted, “I’ve been through this before, you guys aren’t shit!”</p>\n<p>The feisty freshman was transported to Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/","id":3834,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3833,3832,3831],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Where’s the Stripper Pole?

Two hours earlier, the boozed burrito-buyer had nearly eaten shit right in front of the officers, not a block from Freebirds.</p>\n<p>At that time, the inebriated man was all alone. He told the officers it was his 21st birthday, which his ID confirmed, and they allowed him to call for a sober escort. When Jesus, his friend and savior, arrived minutes later, the deputies told him to take his legally drunk friend straight home.</p>\n<p>When the officers later spotted the blacked-out birthday boy outside Freebirds, he was even more intoxicated. The officers asked why he wasn’t at home, and he told them that he was still trying to find his way.</p>\n<p>His birthday nearly two hours past, the deputies felt no remorse in leading the 21-year-old to a bed… at the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Where’s Amy?</b></p>\n<p>Sat., Feb. 27, 1:50 a.m. — Deputies working the late shift were called to the 6600 block of Trigo Road on reports that someone was disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p>When the officers arrived, they spotted a young man pounding on the door of the apartment screaming to see “Amy Kim.” So fervent was the man in his quest to find Amy that he was, remarkably, foaming from the mouth.</p>\n<p>Even after the officers contacted the 20-year-old, he refused to stop screaming. In an attempt to diffuse the situation, one of the deputies knocked on the door and asked the residents if they knew where Amy was.

As a group of students walked back toward Isla Vista after the speech, police beat 22-year-old student Rich Underwood into submission and arrested him for carrying a bottle of wine they assumed was a Molotov cocktail.</p>\n<p>“Imagine being in Harder Stadium and having the lawyer of a high-profile national trial … draw connections between what has been happening nationally with what has been happening on campus,” then-Santa Barbara City College student and KCSB broadcaster Malcolm Gault-Williams said. “And then imagine a large part of those attendees leave the stadium and … watch as police not just arrest a student but beat the shit out of him.”</p>\n<p>According to John Riley, a second-year student living on Del Playa Drive at the time, the police’s actions fueled student anger.</p>\n<p>“Cops arrested this guy and set everything off,” Riley said. “It was like throwing a match into a gasoline can, everybody just went nuts.”</p>\n<p>Later that night, the bank was looted and set on fire on two separate occasions — once between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. when a dumpster was lit on fire and once around midnight when gasoline was used to rekindle the blaze.</p>\n<p>According to Professor Emeritus Richard Flacks, a well-known liberal leader whose appointment to the Sociology Dept. in 1969 caused a stir among conservatives including then-Governor Ronald Reagan, the burning of the bank was not a premeditated event.</p>\n<p>“By evening I would guess hundreds of people were in the street and at some point people lit a trash dumpster and pushed it through the bank doors,” Flacks said. “I kind of never believed people thought that would happen.”</p>\n<p>Some students saw the bank as a symbol of big business, capitalism and the Vietnam War, citing its ties to the defense industry.</p>\n<p>“It was the biggest capitalist thing around,” Becca Wilson, a fourth-year student and then-editor in chief of El Gaucho, the predecessor to the Daily Nexus, said. “It was a symbol of the corporations that benefited from war and were oppressing people all over world, in whose interest government was acting.”</p>\n<p>Others maintain that the bank was burned purely out of anger and frustration with overwhelming police presence.</p>\n<p>“The day afterwards a lot of it was rationalized as anti-war,” Desilet said. “The bank was seen to be in league with defense corporations providing armaments for Vietnam. That was the rationale given, but in my view it was more. It was locally centered with a lot of local anger toward police that had developed over time.”</p>\n<p>“People were just pissed off. They were really pissed off”</p>\n<p>The 1969-70 year was tumultuous in the school’s history, with tension on campus growing alongside national unrest and disagreement over the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>The voting age in 1970 was 21, but after the lottery system was instituted for the draft, many younger students received numbers that increased their chances of deployment after graduation.</p>\n<p>Wilson said that the draft was what really brought the reality of the war home to students.</p>\n<p>“When I started in fall of 1966, there were literally a handful of people demonstrating, just a quiet little vigil in front of the library,” she said. “Three years later it was a widespread movement where probably most students were against the war. By that time, students started to be drafted. It changed the whole atmosphere, became much more personal.”</p>\n<p>The charged political climate of the time was evident well beyond the confines of Isla Vista, too.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine now, but the whole country was just boiling then, with the Chicago Seven, the war, people getting drafted … the whole country was pretty well out of control,” Riley said.</p>\n<p>According to Desilet, many of the students targeted their rage at the ever-present law enforcement officers patrolling Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Tensions were high in I.V. toward anything and anyone who represented enforcement of the status quo, and the most immediate and visible representatives of this status quo line of defense turned out to be police and narcotics agents,” Desilet said. “The accumulated rage of the disenfranchised and the waiting and unwilling recruits in line for Vietnam landed squarely on the county sheriff and his agents.”</p>\n<p>On top of this, the growing drug culture and hippie lifestyle of the time widened the generation gap between students and police, who patrolled Isla Vista and campus in riot gear, often using tear gas to disperse crowds.</p>\n<p>“There was nobody over 25, hardly, and this counter culture, drug culture climate, which meant police were unable to understand, or appreciate Isla Vista so to speak,” Flacks said. “[The police] really thought the students were bad guys and that they were at odds with students. And vice versa. Students knew if they were driving [a] Volkswagen van painted up or generally had long hair hippy attire you were going to be harassed by police, stopped in traffic, pulled over, etc.”</p>\n<p>Although many students were not embroiled in conflict with the police and demonstrations against the war, anger was the primary motivation for those who played a role in the burning of the bank.</p>\n<p>An Occupied Territory</p>\n<p>Once the smoke cleared on Feb. 26 — with the Bank of America building in ruins — Gov. Reagan declared a state of emergency.</p>\n<p>“[Isla Vista] was just dramatically changed,” Gault-Williams said. “Everybody was walking on eggshells. Some were happy, some angry … all kinds of moods. Everyone began to unite even more so after the bank burning in respect to police.”</p>\n<p>A curfew was instituted in Isla Vista and nearly 300 people were arrested and taken to the county jail.</p>\n<p>“Everybody sensed huge confrontation the night after,” Desilet explained. “I went out on street again to photograph in the early evening. When I was on Ocean Road taking pictures of police in the San Rafael parking lot … they arrested me and I was taken to their staging area. We were then bussed out to fire station down on Storke Road and eventually over to the new county jail, which was so new that they didn’t even have it open yet.”</p>\n<p>The National Guard and Los Angeles County SWAT teams were called in to help maintain order. Bank of America declared that it would not withdraw from Isla Vista and constructed a trailer as a makeshift bank, which quickly became the target of numerous demonstrations.</p>\n<p>On April 18, a rally was scheduled against the temporary bank. Associated Students President Bill James went on the radio to speak against further violence, urging students to protect the bank from vandalism.</p>\n<p>Police arrived in armored trucks, dressed in riot gear and armed with tear gas. Amid the confusion, 22-year-old UCSB student Kevin Moran was shot and killed.</p>\n<p>Although the police claimed the bullet originated from a sniper in the crowd, a ballistics test determined that it came from a policeman’s rifle. The incident was deemed an accident, and the officer was later exonerated.</p>\n<p>On June 3, 17 students were indicted for the bank burning, after supposedly being identified from photographs taken on Feb. 25.  The indictments were met with controversy, however, as several of the students had solid alibis.</p>\n<p>“What was obvious was that they were all well-known campus activist radical leaders,” Flacks said. “The idea that that particular group of well-known people were all together around that dumpster was outlandish. Especially since some of them were among those arrested the day before and were actually in jail when the bank burned.”</p>\n<p>“Social Change, Fair Play and Peace”</p>\n<p>The rallies, tear gas and arrests continued throughout the course of the year, and according to former students, fundamentally changed the face of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The riots destroyed the town,” Riley said. “Before the riots it was this cute little town, nice cinemas, new bookstores, more like a Santa Cruz or something, and after it was … burned out. It just destroyed the town.”</p>\n<p>Yet a new Isla Vista emerged from the smoldering ruins of the Bank of America.</p>\n<p>“It suddenly created a lot of attention on Isla Vista itself and how students were living and sparked the creation of many community organizations and grassroots movements that turned into institutions,” Wilson said.</p>\n<p>The Bank of America closed its Isla Vista branch in 1981, opting to open an ATM on Embarcadero del Norte instead. Embarcadero Hall stands in place of the bank today. A plaque in front commemorates Kevin Moran.</p>\n<p>It reads, “For Social Change, Fair Play and Peace.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20339\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20339\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/","id":3544,"author":{"id":338,"name":"Taylor Haggerty"},"related":[3543,3542,3541],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. -- A manly expletive (\"Fuck!\") drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Dishonorably Drunk</b></p>\n<p>Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. — A manly expletive (“Fuck!”) drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.</p>\n<p>Looking around for the source, the deputies spotted a well-built young man staggering down the street, all alone.

When the deputies arrived some moments later, they caught the young lady with her pants down… literally.</p>\n<p>Averting their eyes, the deputies waited for the 19-year-old woman to do up her pants and then sat her down on the curb to question her. When asked her address, she told the officers she lived at “6622 Abrego.” Seconds later, she told them “6255 Picasso.” Needless to say, neither was correct.</p>\n<p>The lost drunk was given solace, however, when the officers arrested her: She didn’t need to worry about finding a place to sleep.

The deputies searched his pockets and found a passport — a Russian passport.</p>\n<p>The officers arrested the 19-year-old Russian reveler for evading a police officer and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Can You Point Me to the Sex Castles?</b><br>\n<i>Sat., Feb. 13, 1:43 a.m.</i> — An especially rude freshman staggering down the 6700 block of Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>With whiskey on his breath, the 19-year-old had a wicked tongue, shouting obscenities at anyone who passed. When the deputies arrived, however, he sheepishly said, “Hey, man,” and sat when they told him to sit.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the pugnacious partier if he knew where he was, to which he (incorrectly) stated, “Sure I do; I’m on Del Playa.” He told the officers he lived in the Santa Catalina dorms but could not point in their direction.</p>\n<p>With no other recourse, the deputies arrested him and took him to the IVFP Sheriff’s Station, where he promptly threw up. He was then put in a patrol car — where he again vomited — and driven to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where, surprise, he threw up again.</p>\n<p>With nothing left in his stomach, they housed the not-so-fresh prince, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/","id":3830,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3829,3828,3827],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fighting A New Battle","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After seven years and two months as a Marine, Alonso Zavala went from soldier to UCSB student in just seven days.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After seven years and two months as a Marine, Alonso Zavala went from soldier to UCSB student in just seven days.</p>\n<p>“I had one week to transition from military life,” Zavala said. “It took me a whole quarter to assimilate and realize that I can do things I can’t in uniform, like just putting my hands in my pocket. … But during my first week, one thing I noticed is that everyone goes out of their way to help you.”</p>\n<p>Zavala, who served in Kuwait and Iraq as a lead vehicle driver and member of a security detail, is one of about 80 student veterans on campus.

I won’t put it out there unless it’s the right situation.”</p>\n<p>On one occasion, though, Zavala did speak up and the reaction surprised him.</p>\n<p>“One guy came up to me after the class and thanked me for my service,” Zavala said. “I didn’t know what to say.”</p>\n<p>Tonight, Student Veterans at UCSB — which Zavala joined when he arrived at the campus — will be hosting its third Ask-A-Vet forum in the Student Resource Building Multipurpose Room at 7:30.</p>\n<p>“We’ll focus on the experiences of student veterans in the military, the transitional challenges and how it becomes our war from the military to the university,” Student Veteran Organization at UCSB President Quincy Yamada said.</p>\n<p>Every day, former active duty Marine Sgt. David Holmes noted, students go to class with military veterans without realizing the depth of their experiences.</p>\n<p>“The majority of vets volunteer because they want to serve the country. It’s a huge sacrifice to serve in deployments, the time you give up,” Holmes, a graduate student in education,  said. “Eighteen to twenty-two. Those are the prime years of your life, and you gave them to your country.”</p>\n<p><b>A Different Way to Study Abroad</b></p>\n<p>Quincy Yamada, a business economics major with accounting emphasis, enlisted in the Navy just after graduating high school. From his permanent duty station in Japan, he worked as an aircraft mechanic and spent over a year at sea during his four years of foreign service.</p>\n<p>For Justus Hanna, a combat engineer who worked in demolitions, his military service took him across Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan. Hanna, an economics and global studies major, kept a blog while on deployment, writing about some incidents he described as “so out of control, it’s hilarious.”</p>\n<p>In one entry, from June 6, 2005, Hanna detailed an ambush on a routine Traffic Control Point mission in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>“We charge across the road and start receiving fire towards our direction,” Hanna wrote. “Wanting to avoid any casualties on our side by having a face-to-face showdown with the guy, someone shouts ‘Who’s got a grenade?’ the LT responds like he just found a prize; ‘I got one’ and tosses it short of the hole! Someone else screams ‘FRAG OUT!! IT’S SHORT IT’S SHORT!!’ and we hit the dirt. Luckily it rolls into the hole and explodes, myself and everyone around me is on their feet charging the trench shooting through the cloud of dust at the enemy… which turned out to be one guy with a rifle!”</p>\n<p>What stands out for Zavala from his time in the Marines are the long days driving convoys across Kuwait and the friendships he made over the nearly eight years he served.</p>\n<p>“One of the great things that the military as an institution provides is that you make great friends from all walks of life,” Zavala said. “That’s one of the things that I miss most, my friends and the friends you make there.”</p>\n<p>Holmes founded SVO at UCSB in 2007 and is currently conducting research on student veterans in higher education. As a Marine, Holmes spent time in Greece and Japan and transferred to UCSB in 2005.</p>\n<p>“The transition can be quite difficult,” he said. “It’s like night and day. … I got here and felt very disconnected.”</p>\n<p><b>Combat to Classroom</b></p>\n<p>While visiting the campus on what he deemed a “recon trip,” Hanna said he appreciated the UCSB lifestyle and the introduction to SVO at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“After I got accepted, I got an email from Quincy welcoming me,” Hanna noted. “Everyone seemed to have an outpouring of support and I was totally ecstatic.”</p>\n<p>Holmes said one of the major reasons he started SVO at UCSB was to provide a place for veterans to feel comfortable on campus.</p>\n<p>“Camaraderie is a big part of the group,” Holmes said. “It’s a support network; a way for people to find others with similar experiences. It’s hard to make friends with the 18-year-old sitting next to you in class.”</p>\n<p>For Holmes and other veterans, revealing their military service can often mean facing difficult situations.</p>\n<p>“The first thing people ask is, ‘Have you killed someone?'” Holmes said. “That’s not an appropriate question. There are guys here that have, and some may not want to talk about it.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Kirsten Gabriel, a psychologist in Counseling Services with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder training, said student veterans’ experiences and backgrounds can vary considerably.</p>\n<p>“They’re not traditional 18-22 students,” she said. “They’re already older. They weren’t just hanging out at home playing video games, they were out on deployment and part of a disciplined and structured environment. They’re coming to a university environment where things are much more fluid, where they don’t wear uniforms and there’s not a rigid time bound structure. … It’s a culture shock in many ways. You’re used to having a gun on you, and it’s a pretty disconcerting feeling not to anymore.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Gabriel, who worked for five years in a Baltimore VA medical center, said veterans face specific issues that other students can’t always understand.</p>\n<p>“In combat, some things once you see, you can’t unsee them,” Dr. Gabriel said. “It can start to become the crisis of, ‘What is the meaning of what I just did over there and the sacrifices people made?’ It can be distressing to people to make sense of what they had done.”</p>\n<p>For many veterans on campus, the student organization offers a way to integrate into the college community.</p>\n<p>“I feel so old sometimes,” Hanna said. “That’s another factor for reintegrating as a vet: As a guy like me, married, 27, I can’t integrate with a lot of the activities here. As a continuing and transfer student, you’re really a fish out of water.”</p>\n<p>While his time in the service was defining, Yamada said, it also means his college experience is tinged with something his peers often don’t share.</p>\n<p>“It feels like I put my life on hold,” he said. “In hindsight, I’m catching up.”</p>\n<p><b>Making the Grade</b></p>\n<p>Along with SVO at UCSB, staff and administrators are currently pushing for a more veteran-friendly campus, particularly through the Veterans Resource Team. The interdisciplinary team aims to offer training for faculty and staff and develop a network of mentors for incoming veterans; last quarter, a member of the VRT, Women’s Center Program Director Jess O’Keefe, also started teaching a class specifically for veterans.</p>\n<p>“The long-range goal is that all students feel comfortable and have resources they need to be successful at UCSB,” Dr. Gabriel said. “They have particular issues and have served their country in ways we have not. We need to honor them and help them be successful.”</p>\n<p>According to Doug Bradley, a lecturer in the Writing Program and a military veteran himself, it is important to remember that dealing with veterans is not a one-size-fits-all deal.</p>\n<p>“Contrary to popular misconceptions, not all returning veterans are quivering bowls of PTSD Jell-O, waiting to emotionally collapse or go berserk,” Bradley wrote in an e-mail. “In fact, most vets are tired of that stereotype. … For that reason, it’s usually best to let veterans talk about their war experiences if and when they are ready. For many of them, that will be never. Students and faculty need to be patient and let vets adapt to civilian life on their own time.”</p>\n<p>Bradley said his homecoming after serving in the Gulf War was vastly different from what many recently discharged soldiers experience.</p>\n<p>“I had orders to remain in theater for eighteen months, but we came home in six,” Bradley wrote. “Can you believe that?! Six months. Compare that with our current veterans, many of whom are coming off their third or fourth tour of duty. … Vets now are coming home to a much quieter, more ambivalent America. The war has stretched on and on, and Americans –while ever loyal and proud of their vets — are having a much harder time figuring out what these two wars mean. Our vets feel the full brunt of that ambivalence as they search for meaning in their own experiences.

We bought a tandem bicycle when we came to California. … Our lives were welded together on the tandem.”</p>\n<p>While John teaches various sociology courses, Janice focuses solely on the pair’s classes on human sexuality.</p>\n<p>“I’m just hired for sex,” Janice joked.</p>\n<p>“You sound like a sex worker,” John teased.</p>\n<p>The pair moved from randy to affectionate as Janice listed the numerous reasons she loves her husband, naming kindness, intelligence, sincerity and dedication, among others.</p>\n<p>“His cute little face,” she said. “He makes so many funny faces, you’d be amazed. … He’s a lot of fun. He’s dedicated to making our life as good as it can be together. And he fits in some cute little jeans.”</p>\n<p>“Superficial Janice,” James said in jest.</p>\n<p>James also expressed admiration for his significant other.</p>\n<p>“She creates so many wonderful moments for us,” he said. “Our life is charmed.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, the pair stressed their dedication to physical fitness. John and Janice, 69 years old and 64 years old, respectively, hike regularly and are able to trek 3,200 ft. in one hour and 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>John also said that intimacy is crucial to a healthy relationship and taking frequent mini-vacations allow the pair to spend much-needed personal time with one another.</p>\n<p>“We spend a lot of time being intimate with each other so these vacations are very special,” he said. “We like the intimacy that comes from sitting and talking about plans; where to go next.”</p>\n<p><b>The Twins</b></p>\n<p>Charles and Dolly Mullin, both communication professors, have distinctive teaching methodologies, but are surprisingly alike in their personalities — a fit that makes the couple like two peas in a pod.</p>\n<p>The pair first realized the likeness as undergraduates at UCLA when pulling all-nighters to watch David Letterman and discuss Scottish music. According to Dolly, the two never tried to look their best during those long nights, which allowed them to fall in love with each other’s personalities instead of focusing on physical appearance.</p>\n<p>“It was certainly comfort and familiarity at first sight,” Charles said. “It was a perfect fit right away.”</p>\n<p>According to Charles, the two eventually decided to attend UCSB for graduate school, where they stayed to teach asfaculty lecturers.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to get your Ph.D someplace and stay at that institution to teach,” he said. “We had more or less committed emotionally and spiritually to staying at UCSB, which may have factored into our decision to not go into a tenure track elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>Aside from admiring his intelligence and strong sense of principle, Dolly said she trusts her partner completely.</p>\n<p>“We think the same way on so many issues,” she said. “I trust his judgment on just about everything.”</p>\n<p>Charles, on the other hand, said he is thankful for Dolly’s selflessness.</p>\n<p>“You take care of me, which I appreciate,” he said. “You look after the things I don’t like to do for myself, like taxes and stuff. We both do stuff that the other person doesn’t want to.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the Mullins, the communication department, which has been dubbed Noah’s Ark, also houses four other couples.</p>\n<p>Although some married couples prefer to keep their professional lives separate from their personal ones, Dolly said working together can be beneficial.</p>\n<p>“We know each other’s stresses,” she said. “It’s hard [when you have] different jobs and don’t know why the other is worried.”</p>\n<p>Aside from working, living and volunteering together, the pair also commutes from Santa Ynez — a 50-minute drive — together. Charles joked that he forced Dolly to adopt a rural lifestyle.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if you marry a person who’s optimal for you,” he said. “You marry them and mold them. … I sometimes like to say I dragged [Dolly] out there [to Santa Ynez].”</p>\n<p>“But I went willing,” Dolly said.</p>\n<p>“It’s like Green Acres,” Charles joked. “I’m Eddie Albert.”</p>\n<p>“And I’m Eva Gabor,” Dolly said, as though reading her husband’s mind.</p>\n<p><b>The Honeymooners</b></p>\n<p>Although married for eight years, physics professor Tommaso Treu and history professor Stefania Tutino can easily be mistaken for newlyweds.</p>\n<p>Aside from holding hands, exchanging loving glances and kissing, the pair is also so bright-eyed when speaking about each other that an onlooker would suspect they were honeymooners.</p>\n<p> The couple first met over a decade ago when attending Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy. Their different academic callings, however, forced them to live apart during a portion of their relationship. The two finally reunited years later while pursuing post doctorate degrees at UCLA.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard for two academic people [to maintain a relationship],” Stefania said. “There’s a lot of work behind it.”</p>\n<p>Despite the hard work, Tommaso said he would do anything for the pair to stay together.</p>\n<p>“She’s the most interesting, intelligent person I’ve met,” Tommaso said. “You never get bored with Stefania.”</p>\n<p>Thankfully, UCSB is a very supportive institution for spouses, the couple said.</p>\n<p>“They understand that academics are married to academics,” Tommaso said. “It’s a wise thing for the institution. [They] don’t want professors to constantly leave [to go visit spouses].”</p>\n<p>Despite specializing in distinct disciplines, the professors teach a class together, Stefania said.</p>\n<p>“We do a lot of cross-collaborations,” she said. “We teach a class on the origins of cosmology from a physics- history-religious studies perspective.”</p>\n<p>Working alongside each other sometimes creates competition, she noted.</p>\n<p>“Academics are competitive in many ways,” Stefania said. “It’s actually a way to make each other better. It fosters each other’s potential.”</p>\n<p>Like their contrasting areas of study, Stefania said the duo’s personalities are complementary.</p>\n<p>“It’s easy to be in different fields,” she said. “The same would be too close to home. Being in different fields makes it healthy.”</p>\n<p>“Healthier,” Tommaso added.</p>\n<p>The couple also has affectionate names for one another. Tommaso calls Stefania “gentleman,” while she calls him “Mr. Bennet” when annoyed, referencing Pride and Prejudice.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Stefania said Tommaso has had an immeasurable impact on her life.</p>\n<p>“When you spend a third of your life with someone, it’s hard to remember the way it was before,” she said. “We’ve been there for each other for a long time, at the most critical stages. We see each other grow, influencing as we observe.”</p>\n<p>Tommaso also said he has learned a great deal from his wife.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot easier to ask what didn’t she teach me,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20236\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20236\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/","id":3543,"author":{"id":334,"name":"Maane Khatchatourian"},"related":[3542,3541,3540],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Saturday, Jan. 30, 10:47 p.m. -- A man swaggering down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive couldn't help but draw the gaze of Isla Vista's finest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The King’s Can</b></p>\n<p>Saturday, Jan. 30, 10:47 p.m. — A man swaggering down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive couldn’t help but draw the gaze of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>Dripping with sophistication, the 23-year-old man raised a Keystone Light to his lips and, in so doing, brought about his own demise. Seeing this, the officers perked up, happy to enforce their zero tolerance policy, and made their way toward the suave partier.</p>\n<p>Noticing his tail, the Keystone King tucked in behind some cars and ditched his kingly can, but it was too late. The deputies caught up and asked the inebriated man why he was drinking in the street. The Goleta resident, a classy man by nature, took the high road and told them, “I know, I’m drunk in public.”</p>\n<p>Despite the confession, the officers continued to prod and asked the self-described drunk if he knew where he was. Confidently, he answered, “Del Trigo.”</p>\n<p>Convinced he was, in fact, drunk in public, the deputies sat the man on the curb and slapped on handcuffs. With this, the intoxicated man became aggravated and asked his arresting officers, “Why you messing with me? Look at all these people doing cocaine, and shit like that.”</p>\n<p>A quick glance into the street revealed no cocaine, however, and deputies calmly explained why they were “messing” with him. The deputies later transported the man to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>It’s Good, but Not That Good…</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 29, 3:47 p.m. — Domino’s new and improved pizza brought one drunken man to his knees… and into the hands of the law.</p>\n<p>Resisting the allure of fluffy, distinctly cardboard-free crust and bubbling, now-made-from-real-milk cheese, the deputies were walking past the I.V. pizzeria when they spotted the grown man blocking the entrance.</p>\n<p>The 44-year-old — a local resident — was kneeling just in front of the door with a nearly empty 24-ounce bottle of malt liquor sitting beside him. The clearly inebriated man had a wad of crumpled dollar bills in one hand and was yelling at the patrons gathered around him. While his words were unintelligible, one could only guess he was shouting about the greatness that is the new Domino’s pizza.</p>\n<p>As the deputies approached, they watched as the “pizza man” lost his balance and face-planted into the cement. He righted himself, only to fall face-first again. This was repeated several times until the officers arrived and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending discovery of the telephone.</p>\n<p><b>Neighborly Love</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 30, 2:31 a.m. — Deputies working the late shift were called to 6500 block of Seville on reports of a fight.</p>\n<p>Some time earlier, two men had been sitting in their apartment when they heard a knock on their door. They opened it to find their neighbor, heavily intoxicated and royally pissed about something.</p>\n<p>The 21-year-old was too drunk to use words however, and instead just punched his neighbor in the face. The motion proved too violent, however, as the inebriated man lost his balance and fell backward down the stairs.</p>\n<p>When the officers arrived, they found the pugnacious partier standing in the courtyard, bleeding from the cheek. The deputies attempted to talk with him, but all he would say was something about his neighbors “disrespecting” him.</p>\n<p>Unable to get any more out of him, the deputies arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20139\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20139\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/","id":3829,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3828,3827,3826],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Pantsless Partier Fri, Jan. 22, 11:24 p.m. — A man staggering down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive caught the attention of patrolling officers.

The deputies asked the 19-year-old if he had any identification with him and he told them, in thick, slurred speech, that it was in his pocket.</p>\n<p>The intoxicated reveler then reached into his pocket and, in so doing, pulled his pants down to his knees. Embarrassed, the pantsless partier tried to re-cover himself but was simply too drunk to do so. Luckily, the I.V. Foot Patrol are trained for all manner of situation, and one of the deputies was able to assist in pulling the exposed man’s trousers back up.</p>\n<p>With one disaster averted, the deputies moved on and asked the beltless boozer if he knew what street he was on. He replied he was on “Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>While no doubt a reasonable drunken answer, the deputies formed the opinion that the wasted walker was just too drunk and arrested him for public intoxication. He was later transferred to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>An I.V. Wizz</b></p>\n<p>Sun, Jan. 24, 12:47 p.m. — Deputies on a uniformed patrol watched as an inebriated reveler veered off the sidewalk, stumbled over some landscaping and face planted into a hedge of bushes.</p>\n<p>The officers, standing near the intersection of Camino Pescadero and Sabado Tarde, made their way towards the not-so-sure-footed drinker as he worked his way out of the bush. Getting to his feet, the 20-year-old made a step back towards the sidewalk, caught his foot on an innocent shrub, and went toppling back towards the ground.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived, helped the defeated drunk to his feet, and asked his name. He responded by muttering something undistinguishable. Not terribly surprised by the answer, the officers shrugged it off and asked him where he lived. While not quite a real street, his reply “Sabo Ardo” was at least close.</p>\n<p>It was at this point that the deputies picked up on the rancid smell of urine wafting through the air, and a quick glance at the reveler’s crotch confirmed he was the source. The urine stains were not confined to his jeans, however. Dark spots on his jacket sleeves suggested he had also managed to piss on his arms.</p>\n<p>Taking extra care not to get too much urine on their hands, the officers slapped cuffs on the pee-stained partier and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20068\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20068\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/","id":3827,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3826,3825,3824],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":154,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
