","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running an Isla Vista storefront is not all lattes and catchy names — businesses can be forced to hibernate for long stretches at a time when UC Santa Barbara is not in session, as thousands of students clear out during breaks throughout the year, oftentimes for weeks. With fewer customers, fewer employees and the high price of rent to pay for the “ideal location,” it comes as no surprise that many businesses in Isla Vista can struggle to stay afloat during these time periods. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92009\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92009\" data-attachment-id=\"92009\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/woodstocks_kaiyi-yang_online/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Woodstocks_Kaiyi Yang_ONLINE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92009 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92009\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have found that in recent years, the gamble to stay open has proved to be more and more successful. </span><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many established places in I.V. have the hard choice of whether to cut their losses and close for break, or try and stay open, according to Boxi Wang, owner of Mojo Teahouse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do compare sales data from previous year[s] and also look at the demographic of [the] current academic year to reach a decision on if we should be open or not,” Wang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang said Mojo Teahouse has used UCSB demographics, along with analysis of their own financial statistics, to help them predict the loss or benefit of staying open. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of retail lots available in I.V. also gives the illusion of businesses having a monopoly on the population, Wang added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People tend to look at the bright side, such as a huge student population in close proximity,” Wang said. “They need to realize that being in I.V. also has many downsides like higher retail rent, minimal share of the Goleta market and a more challenging workforce to manage.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on foot traffic alone, businesses typically can have high expectations for revenue, which helps enable high rent prices for businesses, Troy Yamasaki, the general manager of Cajé, said. But winter break brings a decrease in customers, and despite the density in population, college students can turn out to be a much more difficult demographic to break into,  Yamasaki explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Yamasaki, this is because students often have limited resources and have a higher standard for what they are willing to spend money on and the value they are getting. Businesses struggle to meet this standard at a price that pays the bills, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high cost of living also makes it hard for businesses to have sufficient time to establish the roots they need to develop a following, especially for smaller businesses, according to Darien Nisbett, marketing representative at Woodstock’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would imagine it is difficult to generate the sales necessary to pay your employees a living wage and eliminate turnover in that sense as well,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, winter break brings the challenge of finding people to work; UCSB or Santa Barbara Community College students make up the majority of employees — Nisbett said students make up 90% of employees at Woodstock’s, which means they often go home for breaks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closing the store can bring more benefits than keeping it open; maintaining a healthy store is not simply about cash flow but also maintaining an enjoyable and inviting atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take this time to update the restaurant … [We] see an increase in business in-store from families in the surrounding areas and businesses in Goleta, as well as deliveries,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have found that in recent years, the gamble to stay open has proved to be more and more successful. Yamasaki said he has noticed an increasing number of students who choose to stay over break. And as these businesses have developed a more consistent customer base, they can rely on some of these students to still support the store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We stayed open almost the whole break and we gained some understanding that many </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international and out-of-state students are still here. They appreciate having some place to hang out and eat,” Wang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides winter break, summer also proves challenging to businesses, which often find profits to be cut in half for three months out of the year. But this trend appears to also be shifting slightly, according to Yamasaki.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot more students seem to be taking summer school. The UC keeps admitting more students and I think it encourages just generally higher populations and people that will visit during the summer,” Yamasaki said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Wang, one way for unestablished businesses to manage and learn to thrive in I.V. year round is to refine methods during breaks and summers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not even the initial capital to start a business, but the capital it takes on your personal life to really almost be a martyr to the business for a few years until it establishes those solid roots,” Yamasaki added.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/","id":4286,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[4285,4284,4283],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Beautification Program Provides Work for Local Houseless People","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2020-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image28.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image28.jpg?resize=960%2C540&ssl=1","description":"Part of Ron Moomey’s transition out of houselessness came from a job with the SeeClickFix program in I.V. called Isla Vista Beautiful. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early last year, Ron Moomey was houseless and lived in downtown Santa Barbara’s PATH shelter before moving to Isla Vista, where he occasionally slept in Anisq’Oyo’ Park.

Community Service District (I.V. CSD), hires houseless people and pays them $15 an hour for various cleaning and landscaping tasks, according to Emily Allen, the United Way nonprofit’s director of Homeless and Veterans Impact Initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was homeless, they hired me for this, now I’m not homeless,” Moomey said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said he works around 20 hours a week, responding to the numerous service requests by users of the SeeClickFix app, which can range from graffiti cleanup and cutting overgrown weeds to removing Lime scooters on sidewalks. Anyone can download the SeeClickFix app, take photos of a nuisance in Isla Vista and someone — possibly Moomey — will fix the problem.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since working as the local beautification specialist, Moomey said that he has seen a tangible change in the community, in part from the work he has done so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know a lot of the homeless individuals here. Well, I guess I inspired them; they see what I’m doing picking up trash, doing landscaping stuff. They’ve been cleaning stuff up themselves,” Moomey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey also plans to work with landscaping architect Lynn Kirby on the new Isla Vista Community Center, and he said they are currently deciding on how to landscape the area surrounding the building. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD began using SeeClickFix in April 2019 as part of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pilot program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with United Way. Moomey was one of the original employees and was “critical in getting the project started in Isla Vista,” Allen said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Way originally hired Moomey and one other employee for the program’s launch, but the other person moved to live with family on the East Coast, according to Christina Lydick, former beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista. For a few months, Moomey was the only beautification specialist in the program and responded to most of the service requests, according to Allen. United Way hired two new houseless community members in November 2019, and they started work this January.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the living wage in Santa Barbara County is $16.50 an hour for a working adult with no children, according to the </span><a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06083\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIT Living Wage Calculator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the minimum wage in the county is $12 an hour for businesses with less than 26 employees and $13 an hour for businesses that employ 26 or more employees. Allen said that although the program is intended as a work experience project, the positions still pay above the minimum wage — $15 — due to the high cost of living. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the pilot program began in April 2019, I.V. Beautiful has completed at least 246 service requests, mostly regarding graffiti abatement, according to Allen. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The city of Santa Barbara is finalizing a partnership with United Way to develop a program based on I.V. Beautiful, according to Allen, who added that she aims to begin the program in late February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said that he is a part of the talks between the city of Santa Barbara and United Way and that he may work in the downtown area as part of the program.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been asked to do 20 hours a week in Santa Barbara and continue doing 20 hours a week out here,” Moomey said. “I’m going to love it.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Jan. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/","id":4288,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[4287,4286,4285],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

It was signed by 20 student sponsors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An international student, as </span><a href=\"http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/international\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">defined by UC Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because there is no International Student Senator, struggles specific to international students are not actively being addressed in the ASUCSB Senate to the best of the Senate’s ability,” the bill reads, citing UCSB’s 12% international student population. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accommodate the addition of a new Senate position, the bill suggests that the current number of off-campus senators be reduced from 12 to 11 to keep the overall number of senators at 25 — an odd number that ensures “the Internal Vice President does not receive much more power in becoming a tie-breaking vote.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution noted that a similar situation has occurred in the past, when the Associated Students (A.S.) constitution was amended in Spring Quarter 2016 for the creation of a transfer student senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson said he decided to propose the bill following months of conversations with members of the International Student Advisory Board (ISAB) and the Global Gaucho Commission (GGC), who both expressed a “heavy interest” in the creation of an international student senator position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the bill, the position of an international student senator “or equivalent” already exists at universities such as UC San Diego and UC Los Angeles. At UCSB, the new role would include tasks to address the “unique barriers” international students face, such as language, culture and institutional barriers, according to Ferguson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The international student senator is “expected to represent and work on behalf of the constituency they represent,” Ferguson said. He added that he anticipates that the senator will most likely work with the ISAB, GGC and Office of International Students and Scholars.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the cancellation of this week’s A.S. Senate meeting, the bill will come before Senate at next week’s Jan. 22 meeting. </span></p>\n<p><em>This article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

released during the demonstration. </span>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands were put together from over 1,000 survey responses from a Google form the organization first released during the demonstration, according to Alana Ulloa, historian of Intersectional Feminists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ulloa said in October that the organization “really want[ed] to make sure these demands are representative of what the student collective wants.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization plans to present the demands to the university and “see what they try to implement with that,” but Ulloa and President Kyremina Youssef added that they hope to work closely with specific administrators like Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead. The two admininstrators have primarily been the ones communicating with students regarding incidents of sexual violence in the community.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the eight demands released on Monday includes formally requesting a statement of acknowledgement “from Sigma Pi and other fraternities involved in recent sexual violence and misconduct apologizing to survivors, acknowledging the perpetuation of rape culture, and denouncing the actions of removed members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October, the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a Sigma Pi member had been removed from the fraternity after the fraternity president learned of sexual assault allegations against the member involving two separate women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus spoke with one of the women, who said she reported the sexual assault to Sigma Pi’s president after she learned that the same fraternity member had allegedly sexually assaulted another woman later the same night, Oct. 3. The woman said at the time that she did not file a report with the university or local police. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in October, another person reported to the university that they had been raped in a bedroom at the Sigma Pi house. On Oct. 28, UCSB sent out a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the report, but the warning did not clarify if the suspect in the case was a member of fraternity or not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB chapter of Sigma Pi has yet to publicly comment on the allegations of sexual assault made against former or current members or reports of sexual assault that have occurred on fraternity property. The national office of Sigma Pi said in October that they had </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/sigma-pi-operations-suspended-by-national-executive-office-while-ucsb-investigates-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suspended operations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the UCSB chapter while the university and local law enforcement investigated the allegations, but they did not respond to follow up questions at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Nexus reached out on Monday regarding the status of the chapter’s suspension, the national office did not respond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to keeping fraternities accountable, Intersectional Feminists is demanding that, moving forward, fraternity leaders be designated as mandatory reporters “of suspected sexual misconduct under Title IX.” Mandatory reporters, otherwise known as “</span><a href=\"https://oeosh.ucsb.edu/titleix/sexual.harassment.and.sexual.violence/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">responsible employees</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” are “required to notify the Title IX office if a student brings information about, or an employee becomes aware of, a possible incident of sexual violence or sexual harassment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group also demands that any fraternity accused of sexual misconduct be suspended while it is investigated, and that communication with the student body regarding reports of sexual misconduct at a fraternity or a fraternity’s suspension must be “immediate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two other demands on the list address the university’s communication after incidents of sexual violence. The university </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was criticized</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the fall for its slow response to the October reports, after which university officials held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-administration-addresses-students-concerns-following-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meeting to address students’ concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One demand would require the university to also keep UCSB staff and faculty in the loop through emails from the university regarding the actions it is taking to address sexual violence. Youssef said that one of the responses the survey had received was from a staff member who was receiving timely warnings regarding incidents of sexual violence, but didn’t receive any follow-up communication from the university that students were receiving, such as </span><a href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/webview/c5to3e/6d9fb6f180a39341b8837e9b18119fec\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Klawunn and Armistead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another demand calls for a “transparent” Clery Student Right To Know daily log and for a University of California Police Department (UCPD) crime map. While the UCPD currently maintains a daily log of “crimes that have been reported to the University of California Police Department” and a map, Youssef said the organization would like to see more consistently updated versions of both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization is also demanding that </span><a href=\"http://campusclimate.ucop.edu/overview/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campus climate surveys</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which survey “faculty and other academic appointees, students, staff, trainees, and post-doctoral scholars about their experiences and perceptions of campus or workplace climate,” be conducted on a more consistent basis and include questions regarding sexual violence that occurred on- or off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC conducted its first system-wide campus climate study between fall 2012 and spring 2013; UCSB was found to have the highest reported rate of “‘unwanted sexual contact’ while at UCSB within the last five years,” the Santa Barbara Independent </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2014/04/01/ucsb-students-happy-but-sexual-misconduct-concerns-exist/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to more frequent surveys, Intersectional Feminists wants “relevant student entities or groups” to be able to “review, edit and contribute to the drafting process” of the surveys. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once conducted, the results must be widely shared and publicized to the student body, the organization said. Jonathan Abboud, the Associated Students President in 2014, criticized the university for not widely publicizing the survey results in an </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/survey-reveals-campus-comfort-level/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the Nexus after they were first released. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several of the demands are also centered around safety and assisting survivors; the organization is demanding that the Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) office has its funding increased to be able to put on more workshops and to hire two “institutionalized” prevention education coordinators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current prevention education coordinator is funded by a grant that C.A.R.E. received in fall 2018, according to C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway. Ulloa said the goal of this demand was to build upon the work the current prevention education coordinator is doing and make the position permanent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final demand on the list calls for “mandatory faculty research on perpetrators, not just survivors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said that demand also came from a UCSB staffer, who is currently conducting research on survivors of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to kind of shift the focus to perpetrators, and why are they doing that,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That demand is specifically is shifting towards acknowledging rape culture,” Ulloa added. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-85290\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schroeder noted that citations issued in Isla Vista are down 50% from last year. </span><em>Courtesy of SBSO</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, aimed at curbing the number of citations issued in Isla Vista, allows residents who have violated one of three ordinances — ordinance 36-2, consuming alcohol in public; 36-3, having an open container; or 40-2, playing loud music outside of curfew hours — the chance to wipe the violations from their permanent record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, which </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/foot-patrol-to-launch-restorative-justice-program-offering-alternative-punishment-for-ordinance-violators/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launched</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> officially on Oct. 4, was advertised as a way to create a “bridge between law enforcement and the community” — the same sentiment that has been advertised in other programs Schroeder has created since taking the position of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista’s community resource deputy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must attend a class, typically taught by Schroeder and members of the UC Santa Barbara Police Department, and perform a number of community service hours. Guest speakers are also invited to talk to residents about the impact their actions have on others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting from the program’s launch on Oct. 4 to Jan. 6, 58 people received citations for one of the three violations listed above. Of the 58 people, 49 signed up to attend the class; 31 have finished the classes but have not yet completed the community service portion, according to Schroeder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw a huge peak [in attendance] when it first launched, which was right before Halloween,” Schroeder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that there was a “significant drop” during UC Santa Barbara’s winter break, a period in which most students leave Isla Vista for the three-week gap between quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to be eligible to have a citation waived, residents must register for the program in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol and have to complete the classes themselves within 90 days. Schroeder hopes to launch an app in the near future that would allow residents to sign up using their smartphones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The typical class is two hours long and begins with a brief history of Isla Vista, discussing more “high-profile” incidents that newer students may not know about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees also are guided through an interactive activity, in which they attempt to solve a community problem.

Through perseverance and mentorship, he reshaped his destiny. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios, 42, is now a professor in the sociology department at UC Santa Barbara and the subject of a new documentary called “The Pushouts,” which traces through 25 years of his life and his work with a youth center in Watts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Rios studies underprivileged youth with upbringings similar to his own. Akin to finding a cure for a disease, Rios said “there is no silver bullet” in solving the problem of underprivileged youth and social disparities. But after 15 years of research, he said he has noticed a pattern. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all need a Yoda in life, right?” Rios said. “You want to have someone to turn to when you’re having a rough time and you want someone to turn to when you need an answer to a question that’s difficult to answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But for many of us, we might not have that Yoda.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for a long time, Rios himself didn’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one day, while sitting in a high school computer science class, his teacher, Flora Russ, extended him an offer he had never been given before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Russ] would always say to me when she saw me at school, ‘Victor, you might not be ready right now, but when you’re ready, I’ll be here for you,’” Rios said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was having a really tough time, when I hit rock bottom and my best friend had been killed and I was looking for that opportunity, I talked to her,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Russ told him that she’d be glad to help, but he had to put in the work to make it happen. At the end of high school, Rios graduated on time and went on to receive his bachelor’s degree at California State University, East Bay and later attended graduate school at UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios said Russ was different because “she cared for the whole person.” She enabled him to consistently spend time in school instead of on the streets and would “even go to my house and look for me and ask how I was doing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His personal experience with Russ cemented his belief in the importance of using guidance as a key for success. Along with empathy, which Rios described as “step one” to supporting students, the role of a teacher and education system should not only tell students how to succeed but also show them, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios finds that the education system has a habit of pushing students aside that can’t keep up, leaving them stuck where they are. Instead, Rios believes that every student should have the power to control their education without the threat of being told “you’re not ready. You’re no longer part of this career trajectory.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This style of education is otherwise known as mastery learning, according to Rios, in which students are encouraged and supported in their studies by using tools and resources provided to them to achieve their goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastery learning contrasts traditional classes, Rios said, where “the first thing you hear from a professor is, ‘Welcome everyone. Half of you are going to fail this class,’” leading to student drop out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But using the label “dropout” puts blame in the wrong place, according to Rios. Instead, he uses the term “pushout” to better address the situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we label a kid a dropout, it puts all the blame on them, ignoring whatever issues the student may have,” Rios told NBC. “Pushout is a better term, because it forces schools and educators to think about who they are failing, and what they can do about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If educators encouraged more than discouraged, Rios believes students would experience a system that supports them at their lowest and lends a hand when they’ve been knocked down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good example is in the classroom, where Rios said students’ academic outcomes are increased when teachers hone in on the emotional side of their students, which can take as little as five minutes per class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Education really has to be, from kindergarten all the way to college, an experience where you feel as a student that someone’s got your back. That someone is feeling what you’re going through and respecting what you’re going through,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a professor, Rios does just that and supports students in the same manner he said Russ supported him: with acceptance and empathy. When students approach him for help, Rios acknowledges that he’s not a “mental health expert,” but as a mentor, will always do what he can. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To have a college student come to you and say, ‘I’m feeling a little broken inside,’ and kind of brush it off — you can’t do that,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of [my] best therapeutic moments have not been with mental health experts, professionals or therapists. My best mental health moments have been with my mentors, with my Yodas and with my guides.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the 2014 tragedy in Isla Vista, Rios, alongside a handful of other professors, began hosting “midnight office hours” in Isla Vista to offer students an outlet for support. The idea came out of empathy, according to Rios — he and his colleagues wanted to support students at a time when emotions were at a high and hope was at a low. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students would get a kick out of it because some of them would show up drunk with tequila bottles in their hand. They’d call me by my last name … and we just sat there, a group of professors, and talked to students,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of them, though, you could tell they were lonely. They were roaming the streets of Isla Vista on their own, sober. But [they] just needed someone to talk to,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a larger level, Rios would like to see society move away from some of its “punitive” qualities and opt for more compassionate methods, such as restorative justice and giving students second chances. In turn, Rios envisions a society where people are more empathetic to one another’s struggles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his own life experiences in mind, Rios said he is dedicated to helping others go about their lives in a way that makes them feel supported — and never alone. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My noble purpose is to help those that are suffering and struggling to find a way out, and then have them go and help others,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s how we build a more compassionate world.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The board is tasked with meeting regularly to advise the system-wide office on Title IX policy changes and to provide student input on the office’s decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of publication, the system-wide Title IX Office and UC Office of the President Media Relations staff did not respond with information about whether the graduate position remains vacant. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, Reynolds noted that the timing of her appointment is particularly important in light of recent sexual assault <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795293000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRkktG4x3EpTr6IfWY69YOkBQAow\">allegations</a> against fraternity members during Fall Quarter of 2019 and the subsequent campus <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795295000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsZSIXhGlRx0Nt7lrhQJT9fY0bRA\">response</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, we’re at a very heightened time with regard to discourse around sexual assault and sexual harrassment [at UCSB] … so I think it’s really important that we use that discourse not just to bring awareness to these things and to talk about them, but also to provide tangible change that can prevent future instances,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, especially because I know of a lot of personal stories of students who have or have not gone to [the] Title IX [office] because they feel that the Title IX system is very backlogged, and it can just be extremely frightening to go to Title IX as it is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, Reynolds served as the policy analyst for Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) and currently serves as its director, bringing the experience to her role as the undergraduate representative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the first projects I had was when the Department of Education released their proposed changes to the federal Title IX document, and my job was to read over that hundred-page legal document and condense it,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes to Federal Title IX policy were first proposed in November 2018 by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and would </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">req</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uire “presumption of innocence throughout the grievance process” and a live cross-examination of survivors among other changes, according to the U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-proposed-title-ix-rule-provides-clarity-schools-support-survivors-and-due-process-rights-all&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795289000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2xXna0hJncvtIYtY4cFhcSfOIUg\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The live cross-examination during the judicial process of a Title IX investigation would mean that survivors would be in the same room as potential perpetrators, allowing cross-examination through the potential perpetrators’ lawyer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It [is] very invasive and potentially retraumatizing, I remember that was one that I specifically had a problem with,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Reynolds, it was important this year more than ever that UCSB had representation on the student advisory board, because she expects the Department of Education to make a decision about whether or not to implement the proposed federal Title IX changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Title IX Student Advisory Board was first <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795289000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7uvwSiRXwKb9VOKubgI5ZjjybBw\">created</a> in November 2017 under the first system-wide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty. In January 2018, Mariah Tanaka and Jennifer Selvidge were appointed as the undergraduate and graduate representatives to the board, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summer 2018, Tanaka resigned, leaving the undergraduate position open and Selvidge as the only UCSB representative on the board. She later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/ucsb-graduate-rep-resigns-from-title-ix-student-advisory-board/\">resigned</a> in November 2018 following a disagreement between her and system-wide Title IX leadership over comments made to Associated Students (A.S.) and the Graduate Student Association (GSA) over proposed policy changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since November 2018, UCSB has had no representation on the board. That December, GSA voted to boycott the board over the treatment of Selvidge and the lack of power in appointing its own candidate, since the system-wide office has final say over appointees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board has continued to operate over the past year without any UCSB representation. All UC representatives on the board ended their yearlong terms in the beginning of the 2019-20 academic year, so the Title IX office has had to work over Fall Quarter 2019 to not only fill long-lasting UCSB vacancies, but also new vacancies created at all of the other UC campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Reynolds, it is vital that all UC campuses are represented in decision-making, not only regarding Title IX but in all UC policies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are the ones that are paying for these services and the people that are paid by the UC system, we’re paying for them,” Reynolds said. “So it’s important that we know exactly what that money is being used for, and that it’s a very transparent process and it’s not under some sort of blanket or that people don’t know what’s going on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full board will meet for the first time on Jan. 17 at UCOP’s office in Oakland. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

We have partnered with the Isla Vista Tenants Union and UCSB’s Community Housing Office to answer any questions you may have about UCSB housing, I.V. housing and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AMA Google form can be found below:</span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTt3hO6KMGIOYphwALr7ENmKV0Khdaj2n9azpnC4rYFMp_Wg/viewform?embedded=true\" width=\"640\" height=\"520\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\">Loading…</iframe><br>\n<b></b></p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 14, 2020]</em></p>\n<p><b>When should I start looking for housing? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The best time for continuing students to look for housing for the next academic year is during winter quarter. As early as winter break, students are advised to start thinking about housing and discussing budget with their parents/guardians as appropriate, to determine what would be the best fit for them. Students looking for housing should plan to attend one of the “Housing 101” programs that are offered by University &amp; Community Housing Services (UCHS) in various residence halls during winter quarter. These programs thoroughly cover university-owned and privately-owned community housing options, including deadlines, processes, types of leases, choosing a space and choosing roommates. </span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Begin figuring out who you would like to live with in October. The earlier you start looking the better. Most people find what they are looking for during December, but options remain later on. Smaller places such as one-bedroom apartments get taken up first while larger houses are on the market longer. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What are my housing options (university vs. I.V.)? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For university-owned housing, current first-year students are guaranteed a space in the residence halls; current third-year and fourth-year students also have the option of university-owned apartments, which are guaranteed if they lived in the residence halls for their first two years and they meet the deadlines. For privately-owned options in the community, including Isla Vista, students can access the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for available housing and should plan to attend one of the UCHS Rental Fairs on campus that bring property management companies together with prospective residents.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university offers living arrangements both on and off campus. There are university apartments specifically for upperclassmen and graduate students. Isla Vista also offers many housing options. Both houses and apartments are up for rent. Several co-op houses exist in I.V. as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>How late is too late to look for housing? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s never too late! However, the longer you put it off, the fewer options you will have. There are always options, but you may not find exactly what you are looking for. Looking by December/January just gives the widest range of options.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Is there a best area in I.V. to rent (a.k.a., where to get most of your money)? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It depends on what you are looking for. Typically, the closer a house is to the ocean (Del Playa, Sabado Tarde) the more expensive it will be. Houses closest to campus may also be a bit pricier. However, pricing varies from house to house and depending on the management company. More expensive houses may also offer more amenities and features.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>When do leases in I.V. typically start and end?</b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most leases are from June to June with leases starting at the end of the month and ending shortly after spring finals. Other leases may start in July or even in September before the start of the regular school year. Most leases take place over a 12-month period. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t have anyone in mind to live with? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In university-owned housing, students self-assign themselves into an available vacant space; the other spaces in the room/apartment are filled in by other continuing students through the same self-assignment process or by new incoming students during the summer. For privately-owned community options, students can utilize the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to list themselves as a ‘Roommate Available’ and can also browse through listings of other students who are looking to fill a space in their unit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University housing and many property management companies offer individual contracts for units, meaning you can find housing on your own and you won’t be responsible if one of your roommates leaves the unit. But if you still want to find friends to live with, be sure that you work as roommates. The people you party with may not be ideal to live with. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Editor’s Note</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Additionally, if you’re interested in living in Isla Vista but don’t have people in mind to live with, or are going abroad and will only be in I.V. for one or two quarters, many students post in the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/364409110289576/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Housing Facebook group</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to look for additional people to add onto their lease or for subleasers during the summer or the school year. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t want to live in I.V.? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also options in Goleta and Santa Barbara on the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University housing is the most common alternative though some students choose to live in Goleta.

Make sure the unit has everything you’re looking for. Spend some time talking to the property managers and develop a relationship. Discuss any parts of the lease needing clarification. Be sure that all your prospective housemates are on board and understand the terms of the lease. Some also find it useful to ask current or previous tenants their experiences living in the unit. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t have a parent to co-sign with me? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students without a co-signer may have different options depending on the management company and who their prospective roommates are. A student without a co-signer can have a roommate’s parent/guardian co-sign for them if they are willing to do so. If that is not an option, the student without a co-signer can talk to the management company to see if they would be willing to increase the security deposit in lieu of the co-signer.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some landlords require students to have a parent co-sign. But usually as long as you can prove your income and ability to pay rent, a parent co-sign is not needed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>What are my rights as a tenant? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS has a </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/student-success-guide\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Success Guide online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that goes over tenants’ rights and responsibilities.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What happens if I have a dispute with my landlord over my security deposit? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students with security deposit disputes can be assisted by UCHS. To avoid disputes, it is HIGHLY recommended that tenants have a move-in and move-out video in order to protect their deposit. For a small fee, UCHS will video the condition of the unit before move-in to document any pre-existing damages and then again at move-out to detail the condition of the unit at the end.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) offers counseling to anyone having a dispute with their landlord including over security deposits! IVTU’s office is on the second floor of Pardall Center. Come by between 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. for free service to UCSB students. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What happens if I want to terminate a lease early? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For privately-owned accommodations in the community, tenants generally need to find a replacement and pay a lease transfer fee in order to terminate their lease early. For university-owned housing, residents also need to find an eligible replacement, unless they cease to be a UCSB student, in which case their lease would likely be terminated.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terminating a lease early can be tricky. The most important thing is to make your landlord aware of your situation. You may be required to find a replacement tenant or continue paying if you leave the home. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How does subleasing work? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you won’t be living at your home for more than a few weeks such as during the summer term or looking for somewhere to live without being a primary tenant, you may want to consider subletting. Many online communities specialize in connecting people looking to sublet to those looking for this type of living arrangement. Landlords have the right to not allow subletting. The landlord may first want to screen the person subletting before allowing the arrangement. From then it depends on your situation whether the person subletting pays rent directly to the landlord or to the main tenant. Be sure which amenities will be provided to the person subletting such as a mattress or other furniture.   </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 9, 2019 print

id=\"caption-attachment-91925\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uehling was the first female chancellor in the entire UC system. </span><em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to serving as the chancellor from 1987 to 1994, Uehling was chancellor of the University of Missouri, Columbia and worked at various universities around the country, including Roger Williams College, Illinois State University and the University of Oklahoma, according to a campus memo sent out by Chancellor Henry T. Yang on Jan. 7.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As UC Santa Barbara’s fourth Chancellor, she provided steady and able leadership at a time of both economic challenges and rapid growth,” Yang said in the memo. “She emphasized diversity and academic excellence, and is credited with the development of the campus’s first 15-year Long Range Development Plan.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus flag was lowered to half-staff on Jan. 8 to honor her memory, Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uehling was the first female chancellor in the entire UC system. Steven Elzer ‘88, who was the news editor of the Daily Nexus when Uehling was inaugurated, recounted the excitement that came along with her inauguration, but also the turmoil that encompassed the campus at that time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were very excited about [the first female chancellor]. She was an extraordinary leader,” Elzer said. “There was a lot of politics on the campus at that time. There were a lot of different factions that were divisive. It was a very raucous time in the history of the campus for sure. And she did everything she could to try to unify the deep divides that were rumbling over campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a previous Nexus article from 1986, Uehling’s predecessor — Chancellor Robert Huttenback — resigned following misuse of state funds to improve his home, including a hefty $104,000 renovation to his kitchen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Laurence Iannaccone, the chair of the Academic Senate in 1994, she was instrumental in the construction of many buildings on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She came to a campus that was building poor and program rich. A significant building program has been one of her major contributions to UCSB,” Iannaccone wrote when Uehling announced her retirement, according to the memo sent out by Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we are still short of adequate space, Chancellor Uehling will leave behind a solid plan for our long-term physical development — a plan that will carry the campus into the 21st Century. Another noteworthy mark of the Uehling era here at UCSB is the expansion of the School of Engineering.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uehling also managed to restore trust in the Office of the Chancellor, following a tumultuous time of corruption during Huttenback’s term, Elzer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She put a lot of herself and a lot of effort into rebuilding the campus’ image and the stolen integrity in the Office of the Chancellor in a time that needed that,” Elzer added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She had the best interest of the campus at heart and understood her unique role at the time in the history of the campus and then doing everything she could to do it right.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Jan. 10, 2:13 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote to Chancellor Henry T.

So this is an issue that I’ve been talking about with my friends for a while, but I decided to finally do something about it, mostly because of the amount of trees that did fall last year,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman and Vukcevich met with Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services Garry MacPherson at the end of fall quarter to discuss the tree removal, which is currently underway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said the university had already removed 31 eucalyptus trees over winter break that were considered “high-risk, or near population centers,” including several near Santa Rosa Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Foreman, MacPherson said that removing high-risk trees is much less expensive than fixing damage done to property once trees have fallen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he was told that it cost approximately $750,000 last winter to repair properties that were damaged by fallen trees, whereas it would cost approximately $250,000 to remove all high-risk trees on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman added that MacPherson expressed strong support for the resolution and said MacPherson told him that “something like this resolution is really needed to show the entirety of the administration that this is an issue that the students value and would like to see taken care of.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The language of the resolution notes that in addition to eucalyptus trees “[posing] a danger to public safety,” the trees are not native to the area and “do not support any ecological environments native to Santa Barbara.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution stipulates that the UCSB administration should focus its tree-removal efforts on “areas that have a higher likelihood to cause loss of life or damage to infrastructure in the case of tree failure — namely major walkways, major bikeways, and lived-in buildings (on campus as well as in the vicinity of Isla Vista).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next priority should be areas where tree roots have damaged road or bike infrastructure, the resolution added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman emphasized that the support for tree removal is contingent on the trees being replaced at a one-to-one ratio with trees that are native and support local wildlife, like the birds who typically nest in the eucalyptus trees. The trees must be planted “at or adjacent to the immediate locations where trees were removed,” according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman credited the EAB for those stipulations and said the board had helped with ensuring the resolution was environmentally friendly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ocean Road Housing project, which was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/university-takes-second-attempt-at-controversial-faculty-housing-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recently revived</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after being put on pause after “mounting public pressure,” as the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-01-28/officials-pause-ocean-road-proposal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2009, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-02-05/vision-2025-apt-to-give-ucsb-bad-eyesight/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">faced criticism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the fact that the proposal included plans to remove the eucalyptus trees that stretched along Ocean Road. In addition to opposition to the trees themselves being removed, students expressed concern about the loss of separation between the university and Isla Vista on Ocean Road that the trees historically have created.</span></p>\n<p>When asked about a connection between the resolution and the Ocean Road Housing Project, Vukcevich said he hadn’t read the documents yet and declined to comment. Foreman said that while a number of the trees that would be removed for the housing project were ones that were considered high risk, he wasn’t sure how that would correspond to the project and said removing them “to prevent any incidents” was ideal.</p>\n<p><em>Arturo Martinez Rivera contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

But in a new deal with Hawaii County, made on Dec. 26, protestors have instead agreed to move aside and unblock the access road, Hawaii News Now reported. The protestors will still remain at the site.</p>\n<p>Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said in a letter to protesters that “there will be no attempt to deliver construction equipment to Maunakea anytime soon.” Additionally, he added that “State and County agencies and law enforcement agencies will agree to stand down… there will be no attempt to remove [the] protector’s encampment.”</p>\n<p>The project has drawn significant controversy since its groundbreaking in October 2014 and has remained a subject of criticism from Native Hawiians who claim it is desecrating Mauna Kea, believed to be one of the most sacred areas in all of Hawaii, according to Smithsonian Magazine.</p>\n<p>The decision to halt construction came from the TMT International Observatory LLC (TMT) over safety concerns for workers and protestors, according to a statement from Gordon Squires, vice president for external relations for TMT.</p>\n<p>“The state and Hawaii County have not demonstrated that they are able to provide safe, sustained access to Maunakea for everyone,” Squire said. In the past six months alone, the Hawaiian Government has spent over $15 million on law enforcement for the site, the Star Advisor reported.</p>\n<p>Squire also noted that the organization is taking opposition to its project into account.</p>\n<p>“We are sensitive to the ongoing struggles of indigenous populations around the world, and we will continue to support conversations around TMT and the larger issues for which it has become a flashpoint,” he continued.</p>\n<p>Yang currently chairs the Thirty Meter Telescope’s board of governors, and his involvement faced backlash over the summer from students who opposed the project.</p>\n<p>In September, the UC Student Association (UCSA), which is comprised of every UC student government, wrote a letter opposing the telescope and the UC’s involvement in the project.</p>\n<p>In December, UCSB’s Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and the American Indian Student Association (AISA) brought Native Hawaiian protestors to campus to discuss their opposition to the project and urge students to support their cause.</p>\n<p>Despite the announcement about pausing TMT’s construction, Hawaiian elders and protest leaders said they were skeptical about TMT’s decision to pause construction after initially being given a deadline to vacate the area, according to the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>“[Governor Ige] making an obtuse statement that TMT has announced that they’re not coming for a while just doesn’t hold any water for us,” Noe Noe Wong-Wilson, a protest leader, told the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>Daevionne Beasley, the EVPSA of UCSB’s Associated Students, called the new announcements a “ploy” to remove protestors from Mauna Kea and clear the area for construction to resume.</p>\n<p>“When I had first heard [TMT was] halting the construction, I thought it was a good idea,” Beasley said, who has previously spoken to Yang about his involvement with TMT and is a co-signer of the UCSA letter.</p>\n<p>But combined with the fact that protesters have to move their tents to the side of the access road, Beasley believes “the government is trying to push [protesters] out so that [TMT is] able to go in and resume construction whenever they see fit.”</p>\n<p>Beasley also believes the protesters’ biggest point of contention with TMT — its location on historically sacred land — can be remedied by breaking ground in a new location that doesn’t impose on “someone else’s indigeneous land.”</p>\n<p>“The only solution in my head is to pause all development on the telescope until science is able to advance where [TMT doesn’t] have to build a telescope in an area where it would affect indigenous people,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Plans are in place to have a grand opening in January with students, staff and faculty to celebrate the new space, according to Katie Maynard, sustainability coordinator for the UCSB Food Security and Basic Needs Task Force. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advising center offers the assistance of Peer Advisors on Food Security and CalFresh Advocates; the advisors and advocates are peer mentors who “can advise students on resources related to food security, housing security, and other programs to help students in meeting their basic needs,” Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff at the center can also help students apply for the CalFresh Program, a federally funded program designed to help low-income individuals “add to their budget to put healthy and nutritious food on the table,” according to the program’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A full list of stores where CalFresh benefits are accepted, including the Arbor and most grocery stores, can be found on the Food Security and CalFresh Advocates </span><a href=\"http://food.ucsb.edu/calfresh\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maynard said the center and its staff are funded through two sources: the State General Fund and  a subcontract from </span><a href=\"https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/basics/higher-ed-subcontractors.shtml\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSU Chico</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that helps support UCSB’s CalFresh program. However, the funding for the center’s physical space comes from UCSB’s Department of Geography, according to Gary Lawrence, director for University Center and Events Center administration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawrence said he was first contacted about the vacant space by Melissa Fontaine, the geography department’s food security coordinator, on July 3, Maynard and Mike Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services and member of the Food Security and Basic Needs Task Force.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Their goal] fit with the AS Food Bank and their mission to address the food security issues of UCSB students,” Lawrence said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lease agreement was signed on Sept. 23 and extends through June 20, 2020; the Department of Department agreed to pay $3 per square foot, for a total of $1230 per month for 410 square feet. When the private office in the space – </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-02/housing-services-plants-new-roots-in-ucen-following-tree-damage/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently occupied</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by UCSB’s Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE) – becomes available, the space will increase by 80 square feet, increasing the cost to $1470 per month, according to Lawrence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The location offers a lot of student traffic, along with “close proximity” to other student services already in the UCen such as the Associated Students Food Bank and the Community Housing Office, Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This location allows us to co-locate our services in a central place that is easy for students to access,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
