On Wednesday, Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge James Herman set his trial date for Jan. 16, 2019.</p>\n<p>Galoustian’s two criminal cases were consolidated on July 11, and he currently faces 33 felony charges overall.</p>\n<p>He pled not guilty to all charges. His bail is set at $1 million.</p>\n<p>In Doe 1’s case, Galoustian allegedly found the victim intoxicated in a parking lot and “helped her up to his apartment,” Herman said.</p>\n<p>Galoustian was arrested on <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/owner-of-iv-menus-arrested-on-3-felony-charges-of-rape-pleads-not-guilty/\">four felony charges</a> on Dec. 18 by the UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD).</p>\n<p>UCSB sent out a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/suspect-arrested-for-reported-rape-in-isla-vista/\">timely warning</a> on Dec. 19, 2017 regarding the incident but did not name the suspect at that time.</p>\n<p>Those charges include kidnap to commit robbery or rape, rape of a drugged and intoxicated victim, penetration with foreign object and two counts of oral copulation by use of force or injury.</p>\n<p>In Doe 2’s case, Galoustian and Doe 2 allegedly began text correspondence in November 2017, when Galoustian was in Isla Vista and Doe 2 was in Los Angeles, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>The two then arranged for Galoustian to have sex with Doe 2 in exchange for money, a price they haggled over before settling on $1,200, according to text messages presented in court.</p>\n<p>“So $1.2k for entire day of sleepover,” read the message from Doe 2 to Galoustian.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 22, 2017, Galoustian indicated that he was going to travel to Los Angeles to meet Doe 2, according to the text messages.</p>\n<p>Galoustian then traveled to Los Angeles to have sex with Doe 2, according to Robert Sanger, Galoustian’s lawyer. Doe 2 then returned with Galoustian to Santa Barbara for a photoshoot.</p>\n<p>UCPD Detective Alexis Dougherty also confirmed this during her testimony on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The UCPD, through its own investigation, found videos on Galoustian’s phone, according to Dougherty. In some of the videos Doe 2 is seen participating in sexual activity, while in others she appears to be asleep or unconscious.</p>\n<p>Sanger questioned whether the evidence could be proved criminal in nature, referring to the “arrangement where payment for sex” was made, footage where the victim “appeared to have her eyes open sometimes, aware sometimes, participating sometimes,” and the photoshoot the two participated in the next day.</p>\n<p>Sanger further alleged that all sexual activity with Doe 2 occurred in Los Angeles. He argued Galoustian’s case should be tried under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles County Court as opposed to Santa Barbara County, with a motion to set aside the indictment.</p>\n<p>However, Herman said because Galoustian brought Doe 2 back to Santa Barbara County, it is rightfully Santa Barbara County’s case to try.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Herman denied the motion to set aside the indictment or information.</p>\n<p>Herman also said Galoustian presents a history of taking advantage of women in “improper mental conditions,” citing Doe 1’s intoxication and Doe 2’s alleged drugging by Galoustian.</p>\n<p>Herman set Galoustian’s readiness and settlement conference for Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>The prosecution expects the trial in January to take six weeks, or approximately 18 court days.</p>\n<p>Court documents can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Galoustian-Court-Cases.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Lan Nguyen contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p>Correction [Jun. 26, 2019]: Judge James Herman’s name was previously incorrectly spelled as Hernan.</p>\n<p>Updated [Oct. 21]: This article was updated to include pdfs of the court documents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-84302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">IVCSD board members also expressed concerns about the safety of Bird scooters in I.V., highlighting the potential for accidents and hazardous misuse of the scooters. <em>Sicheng Weng / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCPD has taken a “hands off” approach to the regulation of scooters on campus so far, despite requests for them to “heavily impound” the scooters, according to Matt Bowman, UCPD Acting Lieutenant, who spoke at Tuesday’s I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The scooters are currently categorized under the title of motor vehicles, according to Bowman, who says a citation for riding a Bird on campus could cost $250.</p>\n<p>Bowman says that officers are doing “limited enforcement” of scooters and responding on a complaint basis.</p>\n<p>Despite this, students have ridden the scooters on campus with little to no consequences.</p>\n<p>To better regulate these policies, UCSB formed a committee which includes several university organizations such as Associated Students, UCPD and Transportation and Parking Services among others, according to Jennifer Lofthus, UCSB’s policy coordinator and deputy ADA compliance officer.</p>\n<p>The Committee is considering geofencing as one form of regulation, which would shut off scooters once they pass a certain geographical location, said Associate Dean of Students Don Lubach at the Graduate Student Association meeting Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>In UCSB’s case, this could be Pardall Tunnel, Lubach said.</p>\n<p>At the I.V. CSD meeting on Oct. 9, Bird City Launcher Benjamin Jacobs discussed Bird’s plans to institute a “no-ride zone” for campus on the Bird app.</p>\n<p>“People will… get a notification that they’re entering a no-ride zone which we can tag based on [the university’s] requirements,” Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>The company currently does not have plans to throttle the scooters entering campus.</p>\n<p>Bird also plans to hire members of the I.V. community as “bird sweepers or watchers” who would manage the removal of Bird scooters on campus as well as educating users on how to safely operate the product, Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members also expressed concern about the safety of Bird scooters in I.V., highlighting the potential for accidents and hazardous misuse of the scooters.</p>\n<p>As an example of the I.V. CSD’s worries about the scooters, I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman pointed out that a Bird scooter had washed up onto the beach over the weekend.</p>\n<p>In response, Jacobs said the initial sign-up process on Bird’s app requires users to watch a video that explains the rules of scooter use, which includes riding only on streets, wearing a helmet and limiting the number of persons per scooter to one.</p>\n<p>Jacobs also added that safety is a “priority” for the Bird company.</p>\n<p>The company is also considering taking the scooters off streets in I.V. during periods when high alcohol consumption among residents is likely, he said. This effort would be in hopes of reducing the amount of people operating Bird scooters while intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD said Santa Barbara County plans to set regulations regarding the use of scooters in unincorporated territory, such as I.V., in November.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 9, 2019]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Senate on Wednesday, highlighting the specific changes and non-changes to the policy.</p>\n<p>The UC-wide sexual violence and sexual harassment policy is currently in a formal review period.</p>\n<p>The policy previously stated that all graduate students were mandatory reporters of any sexual harassment or violence. Now, graduate students are only mandatory reporters when “we’re in our capacity as an employee,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>“We are not particularly well trained in this,” she said. “We have sort of a one-hour… online training that covers explanations of all of sexual violence, all of sexual harassment, stalking, dating and domestic violence … It’s really not enough to have us understand how to respond sensitively.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge emphasized that all other student employees who are paid by the university remain “responsible employees,” meaning they are required to report to the Title IX office in the event that they become aware of sexual violence or harassment committed against another student while they are acting as employees.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed changes to the definition of consent. The committee now defines consent as “unable to understand the…nature of sexual activity due to…alcohol and drugs.”</p>\n<p>The policy’s change says the student would need to be incapacitated for consent to be questioned, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the formal investigation time period has been increased from sixty calendar days to ninety business days.</p>\n<p>She explained the change stemmed from the university, stating they have struggled with finding enough time to complete investigations within the sixty 60 calendar day time restraint limit in the past.</p>\n<p>The student’s decision of whether or not they want a formal investigation is now not a determining factor of whether they actually get a formal investigation, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>“The university will investigate things without people’s consent,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the Title IX policy that Selvidge outlined in her presentation was in regards to the sexual assault of minors.</p>\n<p>UCSB does not consider statutory rape to be sexual assault, according to Selvidge. She pointed out that the university is trying to keep in mind 17-year-olds and their dating life.</p>\n<p>However, several graduate students at the GSA meeting expressed their concern for their own children living on campus. It worried them that the university does not see the possible rape of their children as sexual assault, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed the new revision to the definition of sexual assault penetration and contact, which now includes language that is more inclusive toward the LGBTQ+ community, as well as male victims.</p>\n<p>“I am actually very happy with this particular change. This is something that I worked on convincing them for several years,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Power imbalances, such as the dynamic between a teacher assistant and a student, are now taken into consideration as aggravating circumstances in the new policy, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Relationship violence has also been expanded to include non-physical conduct such as the abuse of a pet or the destruction of property.</p>\n<p>The Title IX Student Advisory Board consists of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members.</p>\n<p>Currently, the undergraduate position for UCSB is vacant. Students who are interested should contact Ariana Alvarez, the Title IX Officer for UCSB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/","id":2211,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2210,2209,2208],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Edible Campus Program Breaks Ground on Its Biggest Project Yet","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-10-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/EDIBLE-CAMPUS_Nicole-Wallace_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/EDIBLE-CAMPUS_Nicole-Wallace_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The program plans to donate the food from the farm to the A.S.

Department of Public Worms will be the primary manager of the farm once it is constructed. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“This project has been something that we’ve been really actively working on for about four years, although it was in our minds even before that,” Maynard said. “In order to get to this stage, we’ve had to work with so many different people.”</p>\n<p>Funding for the farm came from the UC Global Food Initiative, A.S. Coastal Fund, the Green Initiative Fund, the Food Security Taskforce, the Healthy Campus Network and the Fund for Santa Barbara Youth Making Change Board, among others.</p>\n<p>“A recent survey showed that 48% of undergraduate students surveyed and 31% of graduate students surveyed reported experiencing food insecurity in the past year,” Margaret Klawunn, the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, said in a speech at the farm’s groundbreaking event on West Campus.</p>\n<p>“Today we’re starting an effort that will help to reclaim food waste and create food for students who need it the most.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said the new farm will produce far more food than any of the Edible Campus Program’s current projects. However, she was not able to give an estimate on how much food that would be.</p>\n<p>“It is hard to put an exact number on how much we will produce as we are proposing an innovative approach, mother nature is not always predictable, and we haven’t started farming yet,” Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>The construction of the farm will go through December and the beds for the farm will be built in the winter. The Edible Campus Program will be able to start planting in the spring, Maynard said.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Department of Public Worms will be the primary manager of the farm once it is constructed.</p>\n<p>“We registered 2,697 students in the last academic year for Calfresh and now we’re creating the space for students to grow their own food through campus gardens and farms,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>The food will be picked on the farm and delivered to the pantries on the same day, according to Alex Moon, Edible Campus Program student coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Our farm is built on a garden movement that stretches back over 40 years at UCSB and even longer in Isla Vista,” Moon said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “We are so lucky to be a part of a university which celebrates student leadership and engages students in the shared governance of our community.”</p>\n<p>“As students, we are given the rare opportunity to dream up new ideas and test them right here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the new farm, the Edible Campus Program is also working on vertical hydroponic gardens at the UCSB Recreation Center, an urban orchard at Storke Plaza and an urban agriculture educational series.</p>\n<p>“It takes many hands to make the vision for the student farm a reality,” Chancellor Yang said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “This farm will be a vital part of our campus food initiative and also our proud sustainability practices.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Kopel selected Justin Nilsen, former solicitor general for the attorney general’s office, to fill the position of chairman.</p>\n<p>The Judicial Council is made up of one chairman, four members and one advisor, the latter of who does not vote on decisions, according to its website.</p>\n<p>At the end of last year, two of the three members, Matthew Lanthier and Roshni Sopariwalla, graduated, leaving Raymond Alonso, a current second-year political science and history of public policy major, as the only member on the council.</p>\n<p>Currently, the council has one active petition and one order of business to address relating to the position of EVPSA as well as allegations of campaign violations committed by Campus United (CU) that could disqualify all CU senators as well as Kopel.</p>\n<p>At the Senate meeting Wednesday night, Kopel said she had been holding off on appointing students to the council for several reasons. For one, she is charged with filling four seats for positions that students hold until they graduate.</p>\n<p>“Once you’re on, you’re making decisions for potentially four years, and that’s why I don’t take it lightly,” Kopel said. “That’s why I want to make sure that since I’ve been in the random situation that four new seats have opened when I’ve become president, I want to make sure that the best people and the fairest people are appointed, and that comes with time.”</p>\n<p>She also stated that of previous applicants, none of the students she reached out to had responded, leaving her no choice but to start up another round of applications during the summer.</p>\n<p>Currently the Committee on Committees (COC) is reviewing the applications. Once they conduct interviews they will make their recommendations to Kopel, who plans on conducting her own set of interviews as well.</p>\n<p>As for Nilsen, Kopel said she has known him since his freshman year through their involvement with mock trial.</p>\n<p>“I worked with him a lot, and saw how smart that dang kid is,” she said. “Really the drive he has for advocacy, and just judiciary in general, and so when he expressed interest to me in being on judicial council, I really considered him, knowing already what I knew about him and also looking at his answers to the questions that everybody else filled out.”</p>\n<p>Kopel stressed the importance of filling up the Judicial Council so that any open cases could be properly addressed.</p>\n<p>At the Senate meeting, Letters and Science Senator Ricardo Uribe requested that the Senate be allowed to question Kopel’s appointments before approving them, referencing the fact that Nilsen was unable to be present at the meeting.</p>\n<p>After moving the item into discussion, senators debated the merits of questioning the presidential appointments, a practice Kopel said was historically unprecedented.</p>\n<p>Marisela Marquez, Associated Students (A.S.) executive director, said that while in recent history, presidential appointments have not been scrutinized as heavily, there has been a past of senators questioning the selections.</p>\n<p>As Senate moved into discussion regarding Nilsen’s appointment, many agreed that they would like the opportunity to get to know him before making decisions that would affect their constituents.</p>\n<p>“I really want to respect Brooke and her appointments, [but] we should be able to ask questions…we should just be 100% confident that they will be able to do their job, nonbiased,” said Senator Christian Ornelas. “I just think it would be irresponsible not to ask questions.”</p>\n<p>As they took their vote to table the appointment until they would be able to question Nilsen, Proxy Rose Ettleson asked the Senate to commit themselves to the same process for future candidates.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Barbara’s Educational Opportunity Program launched the Summer Transfer Transition Program, a project designed to smoothen the transition for transfer students starting at UCSB, for the first time this summer.</p>\n<p>The three-day “bridge” program – focused on helping transfer students with the transition to a new college – was offered to Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) students during the last week in August.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the three days, students learned about several campus resources, such as the Office of Financial Aid, as well as leadership opportunities and the different major departments around campus.</p>\n<p>The program was created in hopes of fostering higher retention rates for transfer students beyond their first year at UCSB, according to Angelica Caudillo, a Counselor for Student Transfer Services, and Brenda Curiel, EOP’s Assistant Director.</p>\n<p>“Transfer students face a multitude of challenges once they transfer to a 4 year institution,” Caudillo and Curiel said in a joint email.</p>\n<p>“[Challenges include] adjusting to the campus, transitioning from semester to quarter system, financial aid support, obtaining a sense of community [and] getting connected with campus resources.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, the first year transfer retention rate was 92.7 percent, according to <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/ug-outcomes\">UC Undergraduate Graduation Rates</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"width: 830px; min-height: 530px;

of the Univerity of California Office of the President. <em>Hayley Tice / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>The percentage of transfer students who were accepted into UCSB has increased in recent years, jumping from 51.6 percent for the 2016- 2017 school year to 55.7 percent for the 2017-2018 school year, according to <a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2017.18.pdf\">UCSB’s Campus Profile.</a></p>\n<p>The creation of Summer Transfer Tradition Program (STTP) was in part a response to this growing demographic.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the EOP Summer Transfer Transition Program is to retain transfer students… and build a sense of community, and support their academic and overall success at UCSB,” Caudillo and Curiel said.</p>\n<p>Several on-campus departments, including the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, Tropicana Housing and the College of Letters and Science, aided EOP in the development of the program.</p>\n<p>“EOP focused in a holistic approach for the entirety of the summer program,” Caudillo and Curiel said.</p>\n<p>According to the EOP Website, the EOP office <a href=\"http://eop.sa.ucsb.edu/about-us\">strives</a> to immerse “income eligible and first-generation undergraduates” within campus life to help them thrive both academically and socially, and as a result, to prepare them to find jobs in their respective fields following graduation.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Elections Board</em>, co-authored by UCSB 2018 graduate and former Isla Vista Party (IVP) head Nawar Nemeh and Morales, asks the Council to reconsider Morales’ disqualification as External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p>The second case, <em>Nemeh</em> v. <em>Campus United</em>, alleges that Campus United (CU) “engaged in slander” of IVP during the election. Nemeh asks that the Council remove all senators and executives who ran with CU from their current positions.</p>\n<p>The Council initially dismissed the latter case. Nemeh then filed a motion to reconsider the case, according to documents obtained by the Nexus from an anonymous source.</p>\n<p>However, the Council lost its quorum just before the 2017-2018 school year ended, leading to a paralyzing situation: Nemeh’s motion and the disqualification case cannot currently be ruled on due to the unprecedented number of vacancies.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Brooke Kopel <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/judicial-council-slots-remain-unfilled-as-senate-postpones-chair-vote/\">must make four appointments to the Council</a> before they are able to return to regular precedings. Until this occurs, these cases will remain in stasis.</p>\n<p><em>NEMEH AND MORALES </em>V.<em> ELECTIONS BOARD</em></p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board disqualified Morales from the position of EVPSA in May when it was discovered she was not enrolled in school during spring quarter.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Code, an executive candidate must be enrolled in at least six units per quarter to be eligible for office.</p>\n<p>Morales gave no comment at the time of her disqualification in mid-May.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Morales and Nemeh request that the Council overrule the disqualification and “investigate the reasoning behind the Elections Board scrutinizing the registration status of Mayela as opposed to all candidates on the ballot.”</p>\n<p>According to the petition, she challenged her academic standing with UCSB on the grounds that she had a personal emergency that required her to leave Isla Vista for a period of time.</p>\n<p>Morales and Nemeh argue the disqualification was in “blatant violation” of elections code because the board had not informed Morales of its decision soon enough.</p>\n<p>They also claim there was a partisan bias in place, calling the fact that the Board choose to focus on Morales rather than another candidate, a “peculiarity.”</p>\n<p>“The A.S. Elections Board has shown a deep disrespect for Mayela’s person, the Isla Vista Party, and the voters on campus who overwhelmingly chose her as their next External Vice President of Statewide Affairs,” the petition states.</p>\n<p>The Elections Board is currently holding a special election for the EVPSA position. However, if the Council rules in favor of Nemeh and Morales, Morales could be reinstated in her position, causing the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/madeline-loudon-is-sole-declared-candidate-for-evpsa-special-election/\">special election</a> results to become void.</p>\n<p><em>NEMEH </em>V. <em>CAMPUS UNITED</em></p>\n<p>In the petition, Nemeh alleges that CU was able to “improperly influence” the spring quarter election results through, among other matters, “engaging in slander” regarding IVP.</p>\n<p>The Nexus first heard of these allegations in mid-May and saw the evidence referenced in the case through an anonymous submitter. The Nexus was unable to pursue these allegations further at the time.</p>\n<p>The “evidence” Nemeh refers to in the petition can be seen below:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84189\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84189\" data-attachment-id=\"84189\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/petitions-regarding-a-s-spring-elections-remain-undecided-as-judicial-council-unable-to-meet-quorum/screenshots-for-article/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"screenshots for article\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84189 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84189\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of anonymous submitter </em></p></div>\n<p>Zeising and Salari could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>“In no way did CU instruct anyone to lie,” Kopel said in an interview with the Nexus. “I have no reason to believe that if the previous council dismissed the case then the new council won’t dismiss the case as well.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh declined to comment for this article.</p>\n<p>If the Council agrees to reconsider this case, and then subsequently finds CU leadership at fault for violating Student Conduct policy, then all senators and executives who ran with CU could potentially be removed from their positions.

Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The special election comes following the disqualification of Mayela Morales, a fifth-year global studies and Chicanx studies double major, in May.</p>\n<p>Morales won the position of External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) in April. However, she was later found to not be enrolled in any classes at UCSB during the Spring Quarter, according to Gaucho On-Line Database (G.O.L.D.) public records.</p>\n<p>A.S. Legal Code mandates that executive candidates be enrolled in at least six units per quarter to be eligible for office.</p>\n<p>Because Morales was disqualified approximately three weeks after the elections were held, UC Santa Barbara’s A.S. Elections Board mandated a special election to be held for the EVPSA position during Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Although Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, is the only officially declared candidate, potential write-in candidates may join the race.</p>\n<p>Write-in candidates must declare candidacy by emailing the A.S. Elections Board by Oct. 7, John Paul Renteria, the chair of A.S. Elections Board, said at a Senate meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>For the special election, there is still a minimum voting threshold of 16 percent, meaning 16 percent of UC Santa Barbara students need to vote in order for the results to be valid, according to Renteria.</p>\n<p>If this voter threshold is not met, the A.S. Elections Board will extend one week to the voting period.</p>\n<p>If the threshold still is not met after the week extension, the EVPSA office will be vacant until the A.S. Spring 2019 elections.</p>\n<p>A.S Senate passed a resolution in July which split the position’s funds and duties among several individuals.</p>\n<p>Temporary access to EVPSA funds were granted to the External Vice President for Local Affairs, the Student Advocate General, the A.S. President, the A.S.
