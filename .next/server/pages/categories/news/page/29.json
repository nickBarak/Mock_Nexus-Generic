Food Security Committee, said the Free SB campaign set its sights specifically on the cultivation tax because of its “reliability”; due to the recency of legalized marijuana, Moon said, the tax is unlikely to go anywhere for some time, which the campaign flagged as a good marker for consistent funds.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cultivation tax first arrived in California in January 2018, when the state deemed that “harvested cannabis is subject to a cultivation tax … [and] applies to all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/l519.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA.)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax, according to the CDTFA, is set at $9.25 per dry-weight ounce of marijuana flower and $2.75 per dry-weight of marijuana leaves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuana is also a popular product among local growers — over “a third of all cultivation licenses issued in California to date are held in Santa Barbara County,” according to a </span><a href=\"https://sd19.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-06-24-jackson-issues-statement-cannabis-trailer-bill-vote\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the </span><a href=\"https://santamariatimes.com/news/local/santa-barbara-county-cannabis-tax-revenues-yet-to-materialize/article_13df5cb0-6165-506a-aee4-6787a650a187.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Maria Times reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Santa Barbara County could earn between $4 and $64 million in tax revenue per year. According to quarterly reports from the CDTFA, however, the entire state yielded only $35 million in cultivation tax revenue in 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, Steel said the state is using the cultivation tax for administrative purposes, namely to “hire people to process the applications for [marijuana] growers and to make sure that legal growers are abiding [by] codes and to shut down illegal growing operations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to change where the money goes, Steel said, is to start locally. Aside from engaging with UCSB student leaders about the tax, Steel said he is also focused on “trying to get our student body aware of the situation.” He hopes to rally enough student support so that local lawmakers will consider amending the tax to grant the campaign access to the revenue stream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Santa Barbara County Board of] supervisors are revisiting [how the cultivation tax can be used]. If we’re able to show large community support behind it, I think we will bring the issue to the forefront of the supervisors’ attention,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel also acknowledged that UCSB students are not unique to facing financial insecurities. He described the situation as a “county issue,” noting that students at several other universities in the area — such as Hancock College and Santa Barbara City College — face similar economic hardships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Moon said he could help support the initiative by “writ[ing] up a resolution in support of this campaign” within the A.S. Senate next year and by reaching out to various campus organizations to further bolster the campaign.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, both Moon and Steel said the campaign’s foremost goal is to garner support at the July 9 Board of Supervisors meeting in Santa Maria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really trying to build from the ground up a coalition of grassroots movements. We’re [aiming] to make those who could affect change, like the board supervisors, aware of the needs and concerns of the tens of thousands of students in the county,” Moon said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

This is especially concerning in the university environment, which is supposed to be a place of open, unimpeded exchange of ideas.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tanner has been with the university since Fall Quarter 2013, according to student verification records. She earned a masters in feminist studies at UCSB in 2015 and has since served as a teaching assistant for several courses within the department. </span></p>\n<p>According to Tanner’s <a href=\"http://www.lauratanner.net/about/\">website</a>, her doctoral research is focused around “the mistaken idea that biological sex is socially constructed or possible to change” and “the abusive and dangerously experimental practices of medically “transing” children and young adults.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said that the university could not discuss specific incidents because of confidentiality requirements but said that UCSB will review any reports of campus policy violations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada declined to comment on any potential complaints against Tanner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a list of some tweets visible on Tanner’s account, posted between January and June: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June 20: “People who think they are transgender exist. No debate. There is no such thing as actually being transgender (a male woman or a female man). Believing so is a delusion. I will not validate such a decision by validating terms like ‘trans people’ Interpret that as you will.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 5: “Yea, like ‘woman’ ‘female,’ ‘man’ &amp; ‘male?’ These words all have original definitions based on reality. Transsexualism started this mess by trying to change ‘man/woman’ to include people of the opposite sex &amp; fantaszing that drugs &amp; cutting change one’s sex in the first place.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 29: “Rather than resolving dysphoria or dysmorphia, ‘transition’ maintains &amp; reinforces a state of opposition to one’s own body and forces one to live in a constant state of cognitive dissonance. This is not mental health care. #StopTransingKids #TruthisNotAHateCrime” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling males women, or females men is the very definition of misgendering </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I feel deeply disrespected by the notion that any male can call themselves a woman and be considered the same gender as me. #MalePrivilge #TransWomenAreMen #TruthIsNotAHateCrime”  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “If you ever had a dick you aren’t a lesbian, not now, not ever.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 26: “Genital cutting of any kind does not change one’s sex and can never make a man into a woman.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 14: “Trans ‘women’ are men, ffs”;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 2: “Stand up for your son because he is perfect the way he was born – a boy. No child is trans. It’s not possible to be born in the wrong body.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feb. 4: “People who believe themselves to be trans exist. Transgenderism itself is a delusion. A man cannot become a woman anymore than a male can become female. This is NOT a denial of the humanity of people who believe the delusion, it IS reality</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript

to her tweets, students have called Tanner “absolute trash,” a “dumb bitch” and “a gatekeeper of womanhood.” One student tweeted “that bitch needs to die.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other responses on Twitter called for Tanner to lose her job, arguing that Tanner’s beliefs interfered with her ability to teach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter from the nearly 400 UCSB alumni echoed some of the rhetoric seen on Twitter, demanding that the university take steps to protect transgender and genderqueer students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instructors should not promote material in the classroom and department that denies the reality of trans people’s experiences or reifies gendered and sexed binaries as essential or real,” the authors emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These issues are not merely an academic debate; when the academy legitimates transphobia, it lends credence to an ideological position that systematically disenfranchises and kills trans people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter from the graduate students also spoke out in support of “trans, non-binary and sex working students at UC Santa Barbara,” stating that “in our classrooms, curricula, and professional interactions, we are committed to supporting trans and sex working students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As part of Feminist Studies, we are committed to cultivating intersectional, student-centered learning and community environments. To the students who have been harmed by transphobia and anti-sex worker rhetoric in our department, we are so sorry.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While neither letter mentions Tanner directly, both letters were released shortly after Tanner faced backlash on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two second-year UCSB students, Kyremina Youssef and Ari Moini, saw Tanner’s posts on Twitter and decided to organize the June 13 demonstration to make the greater student body aware of Tanner’s social media posts. The demonstration echoed the themes of the two open letters: that those who hold transphobic beliefs should not be allowed to teach at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moini said she believes it is “unsafe for the trans community on campus” for Tanner to teach at the school, and Youssef added that the two would hold additional rallies if Tanner continued teaching in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said that while she knows Tanner is “protected by her First Amendment on Twitter,” the students are “also showing our First Amendment [rights] on campus by advocating for our community here and spreading awareness.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi and Max Abrams contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>Updated [11:34 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The branch received a grant from the </span><a href=\"https://theharwoodinstitute.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harwood Institute for Public Innovation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the summer 2018 to help gather data on library needs for Zone 4 — </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/rezoning-will-provide-i-v-with-more-library-access/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a library service area that includes Goleta and I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to library technician Marie Crusinberry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re here to have a conversation to better understand your aspirations for the community,” Crusinberry told the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board of Directors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crusinberry began by asking the directors what they would want for I.V., bringing up the idea of a local branch in the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Ethan Bertrand stressed the importance of children’s programs for I.V., along with language access programs, which provide translation and interpretation services, and technology access programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Kristie Nguyen and Board President Spencer Brandt both suggested library service ideas geared toward college students. While Nguyen proposed extended hours at the Goleta Valley Library during exam weeks to give students another study space, Brandt spoke about possibly increasing the number of common college textbooks and course reserves for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Let’s say it’s a biology class or that you’ve got 700 people in this lecture hall. It’d be great to keep some reserves of those types of textbooks and make those accessible to students,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that that really will help in terms of making the project a success by bringing the college students in and having that community atmosphere that’s all inclusive.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice President Robert Geis raised his concerns over the divide between I.V.’s youth and the Goleta Valley Library, citing the physical distance between the two as a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The library’s really important to those young kids, so how do we get either library services here or get [kids to a library]? My idea is to get them to the library,” Geis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crusinberry recommended three possible initiatives to get the I.V. community involved in the Goleta Valley Library: a bookmobile, a branch in I.V. or a direct bus shuttle connecting I.V. and the library.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bookmobile would be able to bring books directly to I.V. This would allow people to check out or return books easily, without having to go to the library — something that Crusinberry suggested when addressing Director Jay Freeman’s idea for a book drop-off in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The library has not had a bookmobile since its former one was sold years ago, according to Crusinberry. However, she says the option has resurfaced and is being discussed again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a library branch in I.V. was highly supported, it was seen as a long-term project with obstacles. Director Bertrand did note that the opening of the Isla Vista Community Center in August might be able to provide a space for library programs but the bookmobile and bus shuttle were seen as more immediate solutions to bring library services into I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board seemed to favor a direct bus shuttle from I.V. to the library in collaboration with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD). Director Bertrand stated that a shuttle to the library will be something he plans to address with SBMTD at a later date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just trying to learn and get information because there has been talk about the underserved in I.V. But we need to understand what that means. You can’t just say, ‘Well, we want a library.’ There’s a lot as far as what you want,” Crusinberry said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to make sure that we have our data that shows what we should be doing with our money that we have.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

be. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Coffee Company; Sam and Luke’s, named for their kids; or Moose, for their dog, were were a few of the names they pitched to their friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But ultimately, they settled on Campus Point Coffee, a nod to the beach by the UC Santa Barbara Chi-5 freshmen dorms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more we came up with names and bounced them off our friends, Campus Point just kind of stuck. We really felt like we wanted something that identified with the local town,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You could name it anything; I bet you there’s probably a randomizer on Google that will give you different names. But we wanted to come up with something that was kind of a flag post saying, ‘We’re a part of this community.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson, who grew up in Santa Barbara and graduated from UCSB in 2001, said he had always been interested in owning “something in Isla Vista.” When he saw the location was available, he said he knew he had to go for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This [space] was a big part of my life when I was at UCSB when I was here, and it’s such a great spot,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson’s vision for Campus Point Coffee is simple: He wants Isla Vistans to use the space as a place to come together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson referenced Java Jones, which occupied the space before Coffee Collaborative, and how the shop fostered a feeling of community — one he wishes to replicate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Back in the late ‘90s, early 2000s … [there] were places in I.V. that were just like the space where your crew met. It was either Java Jones, or I.V BC, which was Isla Vista Brewing Company before it became a lecture hall. Or Deja Vu, or Woodstock’s, Freebirds, but there was a spot that was like wherever you met or hung out, that was the spot,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be that spot for people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson believes one of the biggest advantages the shop has in creating that atmosphere is the amount of space they have to accomodate customers. In addition to a large seating area indoors, they also have generous patio space, he noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to other coffee shops in the area, Nelson wants Campus Point Coffee to have “killer WiFi” and late hours, but says the store will be “very responsive to the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson wants to be proactive about asking the community for feedback, particularly in the store’s first few months of being open. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tentative opening day for the shop is Aug. 1, although Nelson said that’s more of a goal than a firm date. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until then, Nelson will be working on finalizing hires, training the staff and finishing up the remodeling of the store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson and his wife are opening up the coffee shop in the same space where Coffee Collaborative used to be.

And good, bad or indifferent, we are our own place,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do really want this place to be our vision and not somebody else’s.”</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The Coalition, and Chikukwa, have been fighting for the funding for nearly two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding is separate from the Cal Grant, although it is based on Cal Grant eligibility, Chikukwa said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the funding allocation is a win for the CBUC, it does come with an asterisk; if there is not sufficient projected revenue in the California General Fund during the 2021-22 fiscal year and the 2022-23 fiscal year, the combined $10 million in funding will be suspended on Dec. 31, 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a suspension happens, the California Legislature intends to “consider alternative solutions to restore this program,” Senate Bill 106, the bill written to implement this portion of the budget, reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at UC Santa Barbara said in a </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ucsbfinaid/status/1144756479125159937\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it is waiting on more information from the state and the UC Office of the President (UCOP) before releasing an official statement on when the money will be distributed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email, Saúl Quiroz, director of UCSB’s Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, said that students will receive the standard message they get any time there is a change to their financial aid. However, he said the office will also likely be reaching out to the specific students who will receive this additional funding; students who qualify can use the additional aid beginning this Summer Session A. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If they have a balance, it will first be applied toward that balance. If the funding is enough to cover their balance, or if the student does not have a balance, students will receive the remaining credit in the form of a financial aid refund,” he also clarified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funds will be disbursed in the same way other financial awards are distributed — through a student’s BARC account — Quiroz added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The office is still waiting on “official guidance from the UC Office of the President regarding awarding practices on individual campuses” and more information about how much of the $4 million will be allocated for UCSB, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The allocations for this summer will be tied to historical Cal Grant allocations, and we hope to learn what UCSB’s share will be soon,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quiroz also expressed excitement about the funding and gratitude toward CBUC for the organization’s work over the past two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without their extraordinary effort, this additional funding would have not been made available to our students,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that this funding is the first step toward ensuring that Summer Cal Grants will become a reality in the next year or two.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The additional summer financial aid allocation is not the same as the Summer Cal Grant Bill, Amy Rose, policy analyst at the California Budget and Policy Center — a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Sacramento — emphasized. Rose focuses on studying higher education issues and has “closely followed and researched” various financial aid proposals, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose was the one to clarify to the CBUC that the funding was not technically a Summer Cal Grant Bill, but instead provides summer financial aid to the UC and CSU and is given to students based on Cal Grant eligibility.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cal Grants are administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC), whereas the budget’s “summer financial aid” funding flows directly to the UC and CSU,” she said in an email. “In addition, Cal Grants are available to students at California Community Colleges and the private institutions, whereas the budget’s funding is restricted to students at UC and CSU.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, students could use their Cal Grant aid during the summer, although there is a cap on a student’s lifetime eligibility that may leave them ineligible for that aid in the future, Rose said. The new summer aid means students won’t have to draw from their Cal Grant to cover the costs of summer classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget allocation differs in that it provides money directly to the UC and CSU to distribute but is still based on Cal Grant eligibility, Chikukwa explained. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power. It may seem daunting at first, but it’s such a powerful and underrated way to get things done.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The language of SB 106 is left vague, giving most of the discretion to the CSU and UC campuses on how to distribute it, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose said that one reason for the vague language was to give the universities the ability to work with their own institutional aid programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s possible that the ambiguity was to allow room for both institutions to distribute aid through their existing programs (which have their own goals, criteria, etc.),” she wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose also added that previous versions of the bill allocated funding solely for tuition and fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[T]he new spending plan does not use that language so it is unclear if this summer aid will be used for tuition and fees or for living costs such as housing and food, which many low-income students struggle to afford,” Rose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa, who has been working toward securing additional summer financial aid for students since Fall Quarter 2017, said that while there was a lot of excitement after CBUC’s</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CoalitionForABetterUC/posts/1476519299140032?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCv8FnYqJItuzzrHm4xgmt5zBz-bEYkdecwdLS8i1QIqCFJ7BeYnclayQs2J6G48l24KvLi-l9AIC5snV-miZjhQsSqiHS9zhp7zY4IGKQ4Wc5CSBntDJvFTHeIkL94WEflllosVMWyIrja1Us5iurUyrephO22Wp-EA1qg1cYsBJdkIXOhRqE3_tOZskfiS0ZcHk23IsD0s_Zy1XoBCrCIY-nWu88RqeXiPM2dscxYXfAWs8DG6v4A053h9o2n2x0LlME2bWnvdPvpwjXqZOiw7gnRrA_XsiJnKo0gQhyHtpZUt0Z3gjjf8XK1c9okEdL7XBOuuEk9ImOA2ANll-9ofg&amp;__tn__=H-R\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> announcement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this morning, there were still a lot of questions, too, which is what he and other members of the coalition are now working to clarify. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CBUC has focused its efforts on the Summer Cal Grant Bill for the past two years but has been working on various other projects behind the scenes as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing about the Coalition is there is no specific thing you can say, ‘This is all we do.’ We do a bunch of different things … it was always, ‘We need to be flexible to do whatever we think is the most necessary thing,’” Chikukwa said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he is now the “retired chair,” as he jokingly referred to himself as, Chikukwa has high hopes for the Coalition’s future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know [future Coalition members] are gonna be better than us,” he said. “And when I say better than us, I mean in the sense that they’re gonna do whatever they do, in a manner that’s better than the way we approached our problems, because they got to see a lot of our failures. They got to see a lot of our successes, also.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa noted that most of the members of CBUC are underclassmen or are entering their junior years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daevionne Beasley, incoming director of internal affairs for CBUC and Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs, said the work the Coalition did would not have been possible without the support of individual students and various student groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power. It may seem daunting at first, but it’s such a powerful and underrated way to get things done,” he said in a message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa also attributed CBUC’s success to “all the students who either signed a petition, called, lobbied, retweeted, shared” or engaged with their social media in any way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That, I believe, was the tipping point. It was a grassroots movement, and there was a lot of people, so many people at the table who made this happen outside the Coalition for a Better UC.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: [6/29]: A previous version of this article said that SB461 did not make it past the Committee on Higher Education; the story is updated to clarify that the bill was paused once the budget ask looked like the better avenue to pursue.</em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Converting the restrooms, located by the Associated Students offices and the Graduate Student Association Lounge, only requires changing the signage on the door. Gary Lawrence, director of the University Center (UCen), said he hopes to have the signs installed by July 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen Governance Board worked with Dwayne Mosbey, program coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), to learn more about the process of converting the bathrooms and the potential costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey was invited to speak at a UCen Governance Board meeting in May as a representative of the Trans Task Force, which has been advocating for more all-gender restrooms on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My purpose in going [to the meeting] was telling them what the steps have been with [the RCSGD] in the conversion of multi-stall restrooms, especially because there is no written policy within the UC code about how that is to be implemented, and we just recently finished the conversions for the Social Sciences and Media Studies building,” Mosbey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1732\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal Restroom Access Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, approved by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016, requires all single-stall restrooms in a “business establishment, place of public accommodation, or state or local government agency” in California to be marked as all-gender. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the bill does not address multi-stall restroom conversions, Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey, along with RCSGD Director Craig Leets and UCSB Policy Coordinator Jennifer Lofthus, has been working on an outline for a UCSB multi-stall bathroom conversion process to facilitate more conversions in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey also addressed the board’s concerns about renovations to add more stalls, which he said weren’t necessary to have the restrooms converted. The total cost of converting the restrooms is about $300 to $350, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costs associated with single-stall restroom conversions are typically covered by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services, but Mosbey said the office did not want to cover the costs for multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board is still considering renovations to the restrooms, Mosbey cautioned against renovations, noting that they take much longer than signage changes and could create animosity toward people who identify as transgender or nonbinary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey is sitting on a special advisory committee over the summer to discuss what renovations would be necessary, if any. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD has been directing its efforts on bathroom conversion projects throughout this past year, with a focus on converting multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey’s first step was to update the </span><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/AGRmap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All-Gender Restroom Map</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which details the locations of all-gender restrooms on campus. He is also working with the Department of Geography to signify all-gender restrooms on the new interactive campus map the department is working on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center’s next priorities are identifying all the single-stall restrooms on campus that still need to be converted and working with different departments on campus to convert multi-stall restrooms in their buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said that department heads and vice chancellor hold the power to approve these bathroom conversions. The multi-stall bathroom conversion in the Social Sciences and Media Studies building was the first multi-stall conversion the center helped facilitate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal is to get an all-gender restroom in every building on campus. But a realistic timeline of that, it could take up to years, depending on how many kinds of barriers we run into, whether departments actually end up agreeing to doing it,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Community Services District (I.V. CSD) during its May 18 meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir’s vision for a new A.S. app is to contain all the resources and information she believes UCSB students need about A.S. Sir said she has spoken to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez about the app and plans to work on its implementation throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really want to focus on bringing A.S. out of the dark ages and making sure that entities, all the resources, are [available] in one app,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also plans to secure a permanent location for the A.S. Bike Shop, a project which former President Brooke Kopel began in the 2018-19 school year. At the end of her term, Kopel presented several possible permanent locations to the 69th Senate. Sir has met with Kopel regarding the bike shop and plans to implement Kopel’s vision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beside her other projects, Sir’s primary focus for the year is what she calls Strategic Vision 2025, a five-year outline of specific goals for UCSB that would improve future A.S. administrations Her plan expands upon one </span><a href=\"https://plan.as.ucsb.edu/files/2014/11/StrategicPlanMay2014.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created by former A.S. President Jonathan Abboud</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to audit [A.S.],” Sir explained. “[I want to see] what people think of A.S. now, find the missing gaps and bridge it, and then create the Strategic Vision 2025 to show, ‘I want A.S. to look like this [in 2025].’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir plans to survey students, asking each, “What do students need right now compared to five years ago?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For her office, Sir said she has filled the position of chief of staff with former Off-Campus Senator Adam Chohan of the 69th Senate.

I’m not looking really for people who have experience in A.S., because I didn’t even have any coming in,” he said. “One of my interview questions is, ‘What is your perception of A.S., and how would you like to alter that?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley’s priorities going forward are ensuring that summer conferences are organized in a timely manner, which especially helps with saving costs, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the conferences are over, he plans to start laying the groundwork for his office’s work in the fall so they can hit the ground running. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing I’m really, really wanting to focus on is supporting incarcerated people now and people who were formerly incarcerated, so I’ll be working really hard with my federal policy analyst and statewide policy analyst to see just what is the UC’s role in private prisons,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley wants to ensure that his office has its timeline sketched out early on in the year so it can get as much done as possible, noting that a yearlong term isn’t very long at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his outreach both to students and student organizations already on campus, as well as to incoming first years, Beasley plans to prioritize in-person presentations.

past year and that needs to absolutely change on both sides,” Adam told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The eye rolling, the laughing … the disrespectfulness and the feelings that are created to where certain senators feel like they’re not meant for this role … that’s not how I want any of my senators to feel.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam, now a fourth-year political science major, plans to hit the ground running when Fall Quarter 2019 begins by filling the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/senate-votes-to-open-applications-for-ccs-on-campus-senatorial-vacancies/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two empty</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Senate seats, holding training sessions for senators  and facilitating better engagement between senators and the campus at large. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 70th Senate held its first meeting on May 22 with only 23 senators instead of 25, as an on-campus senatorial seat and College of Creative Studies senatorial seat remained unfilled after Spring Quarter elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the beginning of her term, Adam was also responsible for the appointment of Off-Campus Senator Tianna White as first Pro-Tempore and On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman as second Pro-Tempore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the immediate goal of fulfilling the empty Senate positions, Adam said her focus will be on training senators in the beginning of the fall quarter as opposed to winter quarter, which is when Adam herself was trained when she was a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Senators [from the 69th Senate] weren’t provided with any sort of training, whether it was on the association, microaggressions — literally any training until the middle of winter quarter… our first half of [the 69th] Senate was just whether or not you had an in with Steven [Ho, former IVP], and you could be his friend enough to get the information,” Adam said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t come in magically knowing anything once you’re elected. So [I want to hold] trainings early and often so that all of the senators are on a level playing field and are able to [perform to] the best of their abilities… [and] have the best resources and knowledge to create change and do the projects they want to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another goal of Adam’s over the course of her term is for senators to change the way they interact with their respective Boards, Committees and Units (BCUs). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As IVP, Adam “serve[s] as the official overseer and reference for all interactions between the Senate Liaisons and their BCU’s,” and must “train the Senators in how to be liaisons,” according to A.S. Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam told senate liaisons during their May 29 meeting that they should strive to “individualize” their approach to BCUs by working “smarter, not harder” to address the needs of each organization individually.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Salcedo pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Berkeley, the father of a Berkeley alumunus was charged with </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2019/03/13/father-of-uc-berkeley-alumnus-charged-in-college-admission-scandal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allegedly paying a test-taker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to take his son’s SAT test to help him gain admission to the university, as reported by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Cal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The father pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were no reported instances of backdoor admissions at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June’s audit is the first of two system-wide ECAS investigations into the UC admissions process; the second will be completed by the end of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit report made note of three specific suggestions to strengthen the UC application process: clearer documentation, improved verification protocols and stronger admissions procedures.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure clear documentation, the audit suggests maintaining a “clear documentation trail” in order for admissions personnel to arrive at accurate admission decisions. The audit also calls for additional documentation for students applying on the basis of athletics or “special talent.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the audit calls for a surveillance of donations and philanthropy to avoid admissions decisions “being made on the basis of expected financial gain to the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure an applicant’s truthfulness, the audit suggests the UC bolster its current vetting techniques to make it more difficult for third parties to frame an applicant’s “special talents” to gain an upper hand in the admissions process. Furthermore, the audit noted a lack of accountability in monitoring a student athlete’s engagement in their respective sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of strengthening procedures, the audit reported a lack of processes in place to manage conflicts of interest in the admissions process and the “reporting structure” of athletics compliance offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit suggests an improvement of these processes to “prevent bad actors from taking advantage of the system in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said in a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/current-issues/admissions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that while the UC believes its UC admissions process “works well and has significant and effective controls in place,” the UC “accept[s] all of the ECAS recommendations so we can continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take our zero tolerance policy extremely seriously — even one instance of admissions fraud is one too many,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano also implored each UC chancellor to develop their own “campus-specific” plans and tailor them to the ECAS’ recommendations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Chancellor Henry Yang did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding a specific plan for the UCSB campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of May, the California State Assembly took initial legislative steps towards improving university admissions processes with </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1383\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 1383</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which would deny any university within the UC system the power to grant students special admittance, or “admission by exception,” unless the admittance is approved by three college administrators. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

So with that in mind, as long as the students stay Cal Grant- and Pell Grant-eligible while they’re here, then why would we not promise them four years of federal packaging?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the condition that the Promise Scholar students remain </span><a href=\"https://www.csac.ca.gov/post/how-do-i-qualify-cal-grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– and </span><a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pell Grant-eligible</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through their four years of college, they are guaranteed $120,000 in grants and scholarships when they first come to UCSB from the federal, state and institutional level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program requires students to sign contracts agreeing to maintain a 2.75 GPA upon arrival to UCSB, file their taxes on time, complete their FAFSA on time and take a handful of mandatory classes and workshops throughout their time at the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also have to agree to fill out surveys during and after their time at UCSB to help with the “continued funding and success” of the program, according to the program’s </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/promise-scholars-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the financial support, the program provides students with what Roose calls “wraparound services,” which include counseling and one-on-one support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program initially included only monetary aid when it was first started in 2015, but when Roose arrived in June 2016, it grew to include additional services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Mike Miller, who started the program, realized very quickly that you can’t just give low-income, first-generation, underrepresented students money and be like, ‘Here, go to college,’ and expect them to be able to survive,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose worked in the McNair Scholars Program at San Diego State before coming to UCSB, and said she drew from her experience there, particularly with programming, to help build the Promise Scholars Program into what it is today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose operates as a resource for students to go to with any problems and even keeps stacks of business cards for various UCSB entities on her desk so she can easily direct students to the services they need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with a small staff, Roose said it is difficult for her and her two part-time assistants to serve the needs of all 428 students in the program, especially since they have a policy of never turning a student away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose also recently started a mini-Promise Scholars Program with Joe O’Brien, assistant dean of the College of Letters &amp; Science Advising, in the form of INT 10: “Transitioning to Academic Excellence,” a course “to help students get acclimated to the university and to help build them a safety net,” Roose said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Roose runs a Scholar Retention Program, also created by Miller, to allow students who are academically disqualified and lose their financial aid to return during the summer and take classes. If they receive two B’s during their summer classes, they are able to get back into school, Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these various initiatives require more hours, and a larger staff would help Roose maintain these programs, serve the current cohort of Promise Scholars and expand the program to benefit as many students as possible, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once the students are admitted to UCSB, we just cull the most extreme low-income from that group and then we just narrow it down from there based on grades in high school and how promising of a student we think they’re gonna be,” Roose said about the selection process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t have enough money to bring in every low-income student. Otherwise we would.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose believes that college should be free for everybody and hopes the Promise Scholars Program expands to the rest of the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Merced has already picked up this program, and they’ve started offering their students Promise Scholars opportunities,” she said. “And I think Berkeley is considering picking it up. So it would be nice if we could get this program everywhere.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, Roose is taking a minute to celebrate the accomplishments of this first graduating class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have students that were admitted into USC, into Harvard, into Duke, UPenn, Michigan State and UCSB Ph.D. programs and Master’s programs. And then we have some that are going to be going directly into industries,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Roose, the best part of the program is being a part of the journey her students undergo in college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s incredible because you just go through everything with them. I’ve met some of their families, I’ve been there for them when their whole world is falling apart, I’ve been there with them when they’ve won amazing awards and it’s just ups and downs all day long,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyna Nguyen, a Promise Scholars student and linguistics major who graduated this past weekend, said that without the program, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I may not have had a college career at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming from a single parent household, there was no way I could’ve afforded an education at UCSB without getting myself into a ridiculous amount of debt,” Nguyen said in an email.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89082\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89082\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89082\" data-attachment-id=\"89082\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89082\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=278%2C371\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nguyen is part of the first graduating class from the Promise Scholars Program.<em> Courtesy of Lyna Nguyen</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the first graduating class, Nguyen has seen the program grow and take shape as Roose and Miller figured out what worked best for the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last four years, I’ve watched the program grow into stable home for students like me. I say “home” because it truly has become a place where students can find mentors who are like older siblings, staff who care like parents, and friends who understand your at-home life better than anyone else you could find at UCSB,” Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It started out as a baby program with a handful of students and is now a campus entity with [its] own organization.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen called the Promise Scholars Program “one of the best things” that has ever happened to her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people were brought into college and left to fend for themselves. But when I was at my lowest and drowning, Promise Scholars didn’t abandon me. Quite the opposite; they never left my side. They reached out, and helped me get my life together,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program didn’t just throw money at us and say “here, graduate.” They provided us with skills for the future, and people we can always go back to for help.

Wiggins has since been released. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first report of a residential burglary came in around 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive, according to a press release sent out by Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) Sergeant Daniel Calderon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the police arrived at the location, the woman who reported the burglary also “located items stolen from her home inside of a Dodge Ram truck that was parked in front of her residence.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After approaching Wiggins, Scypino and Williams, who were near the truck, police arrested the three. Police then located more of the woman’s stolen property in the three suspects’ backpacks, along with additional property that had been stolen in a separate burglary earlier that morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victims of the early morning burglary “reported that they were at home asleep while that crime occured.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Sunday night, police tied together four burglaries that happened in I.V. over the course of the weekend, according to SBSO Sergeant Jarom Kemp. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When deputies started inventorying recovered property, they were able to link many of the burglaries together,” Kemp said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In some cases, entry into the dwelling was forced. In others, they gained entry by knowing ‘friends of friends.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the items stolen were electronics, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News of the burglaries raised concern about the chaos of move-out weekend in I.V., as many students tend to leave their doors unlocked during the process and out-of-town visitors are not uncommon due to graduation ceremonies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some students took to the Facebook group Free &amp; For Sale to warn people about the burglaries, while others discussed the hectic nature that comes with UCSB’s graduation since many students’ leases in I.V. end around that same weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One I.V. landlord who runs </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/from-dp-rentals-to-playa-life-i-v-40-isla-vista-properties-under-new-management/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playa Life I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Erin Eliza, posted on Facebook about move-out weekend, calling it a “toxic environment” and “Christmas for Criminals.” She also called for UCSB to have more authority over move-in weekend, referencing the university’s restrictions during Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted in the comments on her post that “1⁄2 the homes we own have had their bikes etc stolen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stolen property collected by police from the three suspects is being held at the I.V. Foot Patrol. Individuals can contact the I.V.

We’ll see if we can increase that number, ‘cause I think there’s a lot that people have to contribute that are not typically in these types of conversations and don’t typically apply to these types of positions,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’re better if we can engage that and make it more competitive next year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil attributes this same reasoning to the high concentration of UCLA or UC Berkeley students as student regents in previous years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Certain jobs, certain spaces, kind of self-select for certain types of students, and I think that that’s fair to consider. The other side of that is, we got 10 campuses of the UC, and a lot of them are very different,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a lot of different majors, lot of different career trajectories, lots of different aspirations, and these different perspectives that come from the campus space and the discipline space are valid.
