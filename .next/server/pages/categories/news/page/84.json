Moon reached out to Capps and began collaborating on the records transfer last fall. The remaining awards will be digitally represented within the collection.</p>\n<p>In a statement released Tuesday, Capps said one of her easier decisions was to donate her official papers to UCSB, while her decision to retire was “a hard one.” “This fantastic school has played such an important part in my family’s life,” she stated.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB Library is honored to preserve and manage former Congresswoman Lois Capps’ papers, which will support generations of students and scholars interested in her 20 years of leadership and service,” UCSB Librarian Denise Stephens said in a press release.<br>\n“We are deeply grateful to Lois Capps for this gift, which will help advance UCSB Library as a destination for research on California history and politics,” the release read.</p>\n<p>Capps, who said she believes “pretty strongly that we have an open and transparent government,” is glad that the collection can be used and “not just stored away in musty boxes somewhere.” Capps redacted personal information to ensure that individuals’ privacy would not be violated.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the material is really very paper oriented, before 2002, before everything went totally digital, so there’s a lot of interesting scrapbooks about her time in office, you know, her calendars, all of the legislation she was involved with,” Moon said on Wednesday “This is kind of an eclectic representation.”</p>\n<p>Capps donated around 130 boxes worth of material, which Moon estimates will take about six months to categorize.</p>\n<p>UCSB librarians will survey the collection to determine its contents, formats and special preservation requirements. They will then arrange and describe the collection for public access.</p>\n<p>“Some things will need special preservation depending how old it is,” Beaudry Allen, who will be processing the collection, said.</p>\n<p>Once librarians process the collection, students will be allowed to use the documents for research. They must request the documents in advance from the Department of Special Research Collections and view them in a specific room where no food, drinks or backpacks are allowed. Students also are not allowed to use pen or take any flash photography because of the nature of the documents, some of which are irreplaceable.</p>\n<p>Moon also hopes to raise funds to offset processing costs. The department receives around $100,000 per year just for the materials needed to preserve collections. This doesn’t include wages or other costs.</p>\n<p>The collection will become part of the growing number of political papers at UCSB, which also include records from former assemblymember Das Williams, former California legislator John Vasconcellos and Ronald Reagan’s biographer Lou Cannon.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Aída Hurtado’s seat was between two women who used all of their frequent flier miles and took extraordinary measures to make it to the protest.</p>\n<p>Hurtado said her job as an academic was to be present that day, but “here was a plane full of individual citizens with no support or structures to ensure their participation in the March; they were simply answering the call of what they thought was right and moral.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the five-hour flight, Hurtado and the two women she met on board confided in each other about the political and social consequences women would face from the new presidential administration.</p>\n<p>Organizers of the march put together a panel of over 40 celebrities and activists including Angela Davis and Scarlett Johansson to speak against President Trump’s administration and his rhetoric toward women and marginalized communities. UC Santa Barbara professor Aída Hurtado was set to speak among those high profile speakers.</p>\n<p>As the department chair of Chicano and Chicana studies, Hurtado’s work has focused primarily on gender equality and Chicana feminism. For her, the Women’s March had a clear purpose: women are not going to give back their rights and they will not stand down.</p>\n<p>She was invited to speak at the march by organizer Carmen Perez, who studied under Hurtado in the early 2000s at UC Santa Cruz. Perez became her research assistant after taking Hurtado’s undergraduate course in Chicana feminism.</p>\n<p>Hurtado said feminism and criminal justice have molded most of Perez’s career. Perez is the executive director of the nonprofit Gathering for Justice, founded by Harry Belafonte.</p>\n<p>In the midst of so many high status speeches and the 470,000 people that were marching, Hurtado did not think there would be time for her to speak. She thought that if unscheduled guests like Madonna had not gone up to speak at that point, then she wouldn’t either.</p>\n<p>The program was running behind so she decided to put away her typed speech and enjoy the moment. Taking in the grandeur of that day was important to her, she said. She was watching her former student navigate a historic movement.</p>\n<p>A few moments later, Perez texted Hurtado and told her not to leave the stage because she was going up after Madonna.</p>\n<p>Her original speech was going to be about the incredible “feminist victories” throughout history: obtaining the right to vote, abortion and contraceptive rights and sexual harassment legislation were just some of the topics that Hurtado was going to mention. She found it necessary to highlight women’s “efficacy and resilience.”</p>\n<p>But, when she approached the podium, she chose not to give that speech. Instead she spoke on Perez’s accomplishments. Hurtado said, if it were not for public education, which is under potential threat by the new presidential administration, Perez would not be here today to organize the momentous demonstration.</p>\n<p>Hurtado expressed the significance the UC system has in the world as a public institution. “We are one of the biggest public university systems in the world,” she said, “and there is a risk that it could be privatized.”</p>\n<p>Hurtado was referring to President Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Education, Elizabeth “Betsy” DeVos. DeVos has a history of being tied to the privatization of education. According to The Atlantic, DeVos’s family poured $1.45 million into preventing Michigan from adding oversight for charter schools.</p>\n<p>The racial divide in the country was also a concern to Hurtado. To her, it is homogenizing to say that white women were the only ones at the march when the participants were diverse in age, gender and race.</p>\n<p>According to Hurtado, the media was expecting a strategic formula to what the march itself achieved. But she doesn’t believe social change is that simple. It isn’t effective to expect a simple equation to define how social change works, she said.</p>\n<p>Hurtado wants the focus on the fact that individual citizens showed up and said “not in my name; you are not going to do this to us.”</p>\n<p>According to Al Jazeera’s Trump Tracker, within the first five days of Trump’s presidency he has already passed a bill with the support of the House to stop federal funding for abortion and block tax credits for individuals and businesses buying abortion coverage under federal health care law. The anti-abortion bill was originally enacted during the Reagan administration and has since been revived by every Republican president after him and subsequently dismantled by every Democratic president.</p>\n<p>The “dismantling” that the administration is doing instead of “building” is her main concern. She said she doesn’t think we should have a “list” of demands just yet when there are so many executive orders being made to take away more of citizens’ rights.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen, but what did happen was magical,” she said. “I want to sit on that for a while.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75243\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-professor-gives-speech-at-womens-march-on-washington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75243\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-professor-gives-speech-at-womens-march-on-washington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-professor-gives-speech-at-womens-march-on-washington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-professor-gives-speech-at-womens-march-on-washington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-professor-gives-speech-at-womens-march-on-washington/","id":2718,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2717,2716,2715],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Solar Origami Takes First at Startup Competition","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1","description":"When Robert Salazar, an origami artist of 16 years, first pitched the idea of marketing an origami solar cooker named Orisun, not too many students could get behind it.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When Robert Salazar, an origami artist of 16 years, first pitched the idea of marketing an origami solar cooker named Orisun, not too many students could get behind it.</p>\n<p>Aspiring entrepreneurs like Salazar were asked to vote on pitches to decide which would become finalists.

So I put all my stickers on.”</p>\n<p>So began the team that would go on to win first place at Startup Weekend, a two-day program on the weekend of Jan. 15-17 in which students launched entrepreneurial projects from scratch.</p>\n<p>Orisun was one of a handful of products to make it to the finals on Sunday, Jan. 17. One team proposed an app called Open, which allows users to keep track of drunk friends. Another group proposed Physique, an app in which users do workouts based on how they want to look.</p>\n<p>The fitness app won third place and Open won second, but the Orisun team placed above the rest because they built a functional prototype on the day of presentation.</p>\n<p>The team developed a simple product: Orisun is a foldable solar reflector able to melt snow on backpacking trips. Users can fold the device into a large cup, and when deployed, Orisun unravels to three-and-a-half feet in diameter. Light rays from the sun hit the shiny Mylar surface, which directs them into a central column for users to heat up water, snow or food.</p>\n<p>Salazar created the circular origami figure made of paper and Mylar on the morning of Sunday, Jan. 17 — the same day the team intended to present. When demonstrated, the Orisun prototype was able to heat up water by one degree every two seconds.</p>\n<p>Judges also commended the Orisun team for making presales and meeting with representatives from REI, Patagonia and National Geographic.</p>\n<p>“We validated our market research maybe a little bit better than others because we actually got money and funding,” Sato said. “That’s one of the best ways to gauge whether people are really going to buy this.”</p>\n<p>She said the team’s competitor sells its product for about $80 to $120, but Orisun can have a market price of $45 to $60. Now, the target market price is somewhere under $100.</p>\n<p>“We have a cheaper solution that has potentially more applications,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75229\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75229\" data-attachment-id=\"75229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/startup-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Startup 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75229\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=800%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Robert Salazar</em></p></div>\n<p>According to the Orisun team, the applications for their product are broad. It serves a recreational purpose, able to assist a lifestyle of backpacking and trekking. Sailors can use Orisun to heat up ocean water for desalination.</p>\n<p>Team member Srikanth Kalluri, a third-year physics major, said he joined the team because he saw the application of Orisun as an assistance to third-world countries.

In-state tuition has remained at $11,220 since the 2011-12 academic year, and this proposed hike will increase tuition by $282.</p>\n<p>During the public forum, the Regents received several remarks on the tuition increase, which will be voted on during Thursday morning’s meeting. Commenters also critiqued some of the logistical problems with the UC’s intended expansion, as the UC intends to enroll an additional 10,000 students over the next three years.</p>\n<p>Susan Willats, an employee at UC Santa Cruz for 30 years, said the University’s increased student population has caused practical issues for the school, as the amount of students it admitted increased in the fall.</p>\n<p>“Because there was neither time nor funding to create a corresponding increase in infrastructure, we have far exceeded our resources,” she said.</p>\n<p>Several double rooms have been converted into triples, she said, and the residential lounges have been eliminated to provide more bed space, leaving students with not enough spaces to study.</p>\n<p>“This over-enrollment has not only added to the unsustainable workload of faculty and staff, but it has absolutely diminished the quality of the educational experience that the university provides,” Willats said.</p>\n<p>While concerns over growth were prevalent at the public forum, many also chose to focus on the upcoming vote on Thursday to increase tuition. President of the Council of UC Faculty Associations (CUCFA) and UCSF Professor Stanton Glantz was among several who spoke out against the decision.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate the fact that it costs money to run this place and the only real two places to get it is from the taxpayers or from the students and their families,” he said. “It’s very disappointing that you are going to be continuing Arnold Schwarzenegger’s failed policy of privatization which has generated over $12 billion in student debt since 2000.”</p>\n<p>Glantz also mentioned a report endorsed by faculty, students and staff organizations from all across UC, CSU and the community colleges that shows “the effect of the privatization and the fact that this could be fixed.” He held up the report at the public forum and encouraged that Regents use it to reform the current tuition system.</p>\n<p>Undergraduate students as well as faculty spoke at the forum. One UC Riverside undergraduate student criticized the tuition hike, saying the UC system takes pride in its “pillars of accessibility, affordability and quality” but is “sorely deficient” on all three. She said students’ wages could not be expected to cover rising costs.</p>\n<p>“If we place the burden of the cost of education on students who aren’t able to make above minimum wage on a part-time income to supplement the tuition costs that are already increasing, how do we reasonably expect any of them to be able to afford the increasing costs that you are trying to implement now?” she said.</p>\n<p>Alex Lee, the president of Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD), also asked the Regents to reject the proposed hike.</p>\n<p>“We as UC students are constantly the ones being harmed and taxed … I ask you, the Regents, to seek alternative sources of funding as well as maximize the money we currently have by cutting unnecessary expenses at the campus level and prioritize the educational experience,” Lee said. “On behalf of UC Davis and UC students, I ask you not to raise tuition.”</p>\n<p>In reference to tomorrow’s tuition vote, Monica Lozano, the chair of the board, said she looks forward to tomorrow’s discussion in action.</p>\n<p>The Regents plan to vote on the contentious issue of tuition hikes on Thursday morning after another session of public comment.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75244\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75244\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/","id":2425,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2424,2423,2422],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Report Possible Sexual Assault in Isla Vista Fraternity House","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2017-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A possible sexual assault occurred Saturday night at an unknown fraternity in Isla Vista, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department reported Sunday.\r\n\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A possible sexual assault occurred Saturday night at an unknown fraternity in Isla Vista, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department reported Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a university crime alert, police received a report at approximately 11:15 p.m. that a female victim had been sexually assaulted in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim told police that she recalled the location of the assault as a fraternity, but did not know the address.

A series of sustained rains could be the only remedy for Southern California’s drought. <em> Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>For the past five years, Lake Cachuma has been shriveling in size as rain levels drop to historical lows, measured as the driest five years on record. Despite promises of heavy El Niño rains in 2016, the Santa Barbara area received only 70 percent of the expected precipitation, resulting in wildfires and rapidly diminishing reservoirs.</p>\n<p>Large amounts of rain at the beginning of 2017 left many hopeful for a swift end to California’s six-year drought. According to the Santa Barbara County Reservoir and Rainfall report, the county has received 135 percent of normal rainfall this year.</p>\n<p>Storms beginning this week may affect the drought classification in Santa Barbara; even large storms last week did not abate a D4 status which classifies Santa Barbara as in “exceptional drought.” The rest of the state, however, is down to two percent D4 conditions from over 18 percent.</p>\n<p>The National Weather Forecast estimated peak precipitation levels between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. the night of Jan. 18, when the county was projected to receive between 0.26 and 0.49 inches of rain. A second storm is expected to arrive Thursday evening and continue through mid-Friday with an estimated one to three inches of rain.</p>\n<p>The third and largest storm is expected to arrive Sunday, which at minimum will have as much precipitation as the storm before it.</p>\n<p>Tom Fayram, the deputy public works director for Santa Barbara County, said he feels “cautiously optimistic” about the upcoming storms’ effects on Lake Cachuma.</p>\n<p>“The drought’s not over, but a little bit of relief is good,” Fayram said. “We will see some inflow into Lake Cachuma; it stands to put water in the reservoir for the first time since 2011.”</p>\n<p>KK Holland, from the Goleta Water District, said, “The biggest potential impact will likely be not from local rainfall here, but an increased state water allocation due to the heavy rains in the northern part of the state.”</p>\n<p>Despite the seeming lack of impact, Holland said, the district is “obviously thrilled to see much needed rain.”</p>\n<p>The last drought report released Jan. 12 by the National Drought Mitigation Center showed “major changes were made” across California due to the increased precipitation this year, but water supply in Santa Barbara County still lags way below normal with a “measly” increase in Lake Cachuma.</p>\n<p>According to a report from the Santa Barbara County Flood Control District released last week, Lake Cachuma was over 753 feet in elevation in 2011, and it stored over 193,300 acre-feet of water.</p>\n<p>Today, Lake Cachuma is at 651.79 foot elevation and is storing 17,757 acre-feet of water.</p>\n<p>This is only 9.2 percent of capacity, which is 193,305 acre-feet. In order for Santa Barbara to move down to D3, which means the area is in “extreme drought,” there would need to be more hydrological impact on Lake Cachuma, which fulfills around half the water needs of the South Coast.</p>\n<p>David Miskus, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and author of last week’s drought report, said, as far as “hydrological improvement,” Santa Barbara is “not very affected.”</p>\n<p>Tim DeVries, an assistant professor in the UCSB geography department, said the county will need double the expected rainfall in 2017 and 2018 to offset the drought. The average rainfall in 2016 was half the expected average, meaning an end to the drought would require four times that value for the next two years.</p>\n<p>“This year, we got 18 inches of rain, and what we’d need is essentially two consecutive years of 30 inches of rain,” DeVries said. “Right now, we’re perhaps on track for that this year, it’s kind of too early to say.”</p>\n<p>Much of the status of the drought will be contingent on February, which has historically been California’s wettest month.</p>\n<p>Goleta Water District declared a Stage III Water Shortage Emergency in May 2015, with a target of decreasing water usage by 35 percent. The district has imposed restrictions on outdoor watering, agricultural water usage and mandates that hotels and other lodging post notices of water shortage.</p>\n<p>Conservation in Goleta to date has been around 27 percent, though for some months conservation has been as high as 40 percent, with “single family consumers” conserving the most.</p>\n<p>According to Holland, the rainfall totals to date for the year are eight inches for Goleta.</p>\n<p>“That isn’t enough to offset the previous years of below average rainfall,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We are still early in the rainy season and the watershed is so dry that until this last storm, there wasn’t enough rain to get any inflow into the lake.”</p>\n<p>There are five different water shortage stages, with stage one requesting voluntary conservation and stage two beginning to mandate conservation, especially of outdoor watering.</p>\n<p>Despite the large amounts of rain, Holland said she remains pessimistic about the future of Goleta.</p>\n<p>“The most recently released drought index shows the South Coast as one of the only remaining areas of the state to still be in exceptional drought,” she said in an email. “If anything, additional restrictions on outdoor watering may become necessary by summer.”</p>\n<p>It is unclear whether this drought is a symptom of human-caused climate change because of the relatively short time period; climate change is generally observed over the course of several decades.</p>\n<p>“If we go into a 30-year dry spell, then we can pretty much say, okay, this is climate change, this is not due to natural climate variability, this is human caused,” DeVries said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Senate passed a resolution on Wednesday to preserve El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room, which is used by several different cultural organizations on campus. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate passed a resolution to preserve the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room Wednesday following concerns that the historic building would be demolished in 45 days.</p>\n<p>The 40-year-old building is located behind the UCSB Library and is used as a gathering space for several cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>Senators Lesly Silva and Jesse Velasquez authored the resolution and presented it at Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting. The resolution supports student groups <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/students-told-to-evacuate-el-centro-annex-before-possible-demolition/\" target=\"_blank\">who have pushed to preserve the building</a>, asking that it be recognized as a cultural artifact.</p>\n<p>“El Centro Arnulfo Casillas is an open space that can be used and is used by many groups from every race, religion, gender identity, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, status, and creed,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Campus building official Ed Schmittgen sent a notice to campus architect Marc Fisher on Jan. 9 saying that consultants found the trailer’s integrity was compromised following inspection.</p>\n<p>The report lists insect infestation and dry rot on the building’s floor, rust and corrosion on supporting steel beams and lack of adequate ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor. It concludes that the building’s problems create an unsafe condition in case of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>The building was categorized as a “severe” life risk per the UC Seismic Policy, Schmittgen said, and advised that the building be either improved or demolished in 45 days’ time. Administrators suggested that although the trailer would be difficult to preserve due to its 10-year lifespan, the building’s artwork could be relocated.</p>\n<p>Over 50 students gathered in the El Centro annex the following Friday to negotiate other options with campus administration. Among those in attendance were Schmittgen, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Vice Chancellor of Campus Design and Facilities Marc Fisher.</p>\n<p>Students listed several concerns, saying the 45-day evacuation timeline was restrictive, administrators had not maintained the building properly and the University could not remove students’ home-away-from-home.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB received distinction and grant money as a Hispanic Serving Institution in 2016, the A.S. resolution states “the Hispanic and Latinx community has seen little to no return on this money that their communities have been promised.”</p>\n<p>“It is clearly stated that ‘We, the UCSB Associated Students 67th Senate, represent and advocate for the undergraduate student body and strive to effectively address their concerns,’ and there is a clear argument that a large group of students who depend on this space want the 67th Senate to act upon their concerns and support them,” the resolution adds.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the A.S. Senate passed the resolution without objection.</p>\n<p>“At this point this has been an ongoing battle for about 45 years,” Senator Silva said. “The whole goal is to finally end this and make it a permanent space that isn’t being constantly threatened.”</p>\n<p>Students will gather in the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room for another meeting with administration on Friday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/","id":3969,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3968,3967,3966],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Goings-On This Week in I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Everything from the women's march to a bunny social: the Nexus summarizes this week's local going-ons.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>BUMP TRUMP</strong><br>\nLocal activists will be hosting a “Love Fights Back” rally protesting the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump 3:30-6:30 p.m. Friday at De La Guerra Plaza in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p><strong>PAJAMA PARTY</strong><br>\nImprovability, a UCSB improv troupe, is hosting a slumber party show from 8-10 p.m. Friday in Embarcadero Hall.

A dean will be selected by July of this year. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The College of Creative Studies (CCS) Vetting Committee is in the midst of searching for a new dean of the college, increasing transparency in the process by inviting students and faculty to participate in the vetting process.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall created the committee in April 2016 and began their search for a new dean of the college during Fall Quarter. The committee has opened town hall meetings to the public during which the applicants are interviewed for the position.</p>\n<p>The committee will vet the candidates and compile their recommendations for the position to give to Chancellor Yang, who will then choose the new dean by July.</p>\n<p>The position is open to faculty from all departments on campus and initially received around 80 applications. The committee has narrowed the application pool down to four applicants, two from science departments and two from the humanities departments.</p>\n<p>Various constituencies on campus are meeting with the candidates as the committee holds interviews, encouraging participants to have a role in the process, said Omer Blaes, chair of the Vetting Committee and a professor in the physics department.</p>\n<p>“Everyone who has participated in one of these events is free to send us information about their reactions, and we take that information in a confidential fashion,” Blaes said. “The committee evaluates that when considering who we want to recommend to the Chancellor.”</p>\n<p>Blaes has chaired other search committees, including that for the dean of the College of Letters and Sciences, and said while campus-wide interviews were held, there were few people on campus aware of the proceedings. He said everyone in the college was invited because members of CCS wanted more transparency in the vetting and decision-making process.</p>\n<p>The committee also reached out to faculty members in the applicants’ departments to join the meetings and offer advice about the candidates.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Foltz, the interim dean of CSS, said she believes it is “crucial” for candidates to interact with students and faculty at the town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>“You want to have candidates meet with people, and in this position in particular, to meet especially with the students,” Foltz said in an email. “I think it’s wonderful that so many students can meet these candidates and offer feedback to the Search Advisory Committee.”</p>\n<p>Foltz said this type of transparency is common for a candidate search at the administrative level.</p>\n<p>Bruce Tiffney, the previous dean of the college, stepped down from his position in July, and Foltz stepped in to temporarily serve as the dean while the committee vets applicants for the position. Foltz said she is not applying to be the permanent dean.</p>\n<p>Applicants for the administrative position go through a vetting process and answer a series of questions relating to their interest in the dean position and their administrative and leadership experience.</p>\n<p>There are eight majors in CCS, and Blaes stressed the importance of a dean working cohesively with each of them, focusing on undergraduate students’ research and creative processes.</p>\n<p>“The key aspect about this particular dean is that this dean is undergraduate-focused,” Blaes said. “They need to enable bright undergraduates [in] … the creative fields they’re engaged in.”</p>\n<p>He added that the vetting process has allowed the involved faculty members from different departments to interact and discuss the future of the college.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the rare occasions that I am talking to people from the humanities about what CCS could be and what the whole campus could be in terms of bridging these very different disciplines,” Blaes said.</p>\n<p>“[The college] is what it is now and it’s viewed as a success, but because it brings together people in these different disciplines it could even serve as a nexus for faculty on the campus.”</p>\n<p>After the new dean is chosen, the candidate’s department will need to appoint a new faculty member to the vacancy subsequently created, a process the CCS Vetting Committee will not be a part of.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the new dean will not be expected to teach since the CCS dean position is a full-time commitment.</p>\n<p>“I have great hopes for this position,” Blaes said. “Everyone says CCS is a jewel in the crown at UCSB, and I really believe that. And I hope that we get someone who can make that jewel even greater.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The new design is more simple and straightforward, and it will allow for easy navigation of the library’s database and its material.</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Library website got a major remodel at the beginning of Winter Quarter, updating its outdated homepage with an accessible new look.</p>\n<p>It is the first redesign of the site in more than five years. The new appearance is intended to reflect elements of the UCSB Library’s physical renovation and mirror its status at a competitive research university.</p>\n<p>Marcos Aguilar, the reference and information supervisor at the library, said the transition is based on creating a new online database system and improving the availability of library materials for students and faculty.</p>\n<p>The new online database is a catalog software update that was outsourced through a software company. This update provides a simple navigational structure and reduces the number of pages required for users to find specific research materials.</p>\n<p>“The main motivation has to do with material circulation,” Aguilar said. “Right now, the catalog looks the same as it did before. The homepage is sleeker and more visually stimulating, though.”</p>\n<p>The reason for the redesign was not only to modernize the website but to make click-thru links smoother and add mobile-friendliness. The library is currently installing the catalog update and should complete it by the next school year.</p>\n<p>According to the Library’s website, the new catalog takes advantage of “increased database-driven functionality to minimize duplicate content.”</p>\n<p>The website revamp is the result of a “thoughtful review process” that involved conducting user testing, collecting survey data and website analytics over many years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74946\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74946\" data-attachment-id=\"74946\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/library-website-gets-first-facelift-in-5-years/library-photo-courtesy-of-karen-lindell/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=2000%2C1071&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1071\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library-photo-courtesy-of-karen-lindell\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=888%2C475&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74946\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell-1024x548.jpg?resize=888%2C475\" alt=\"The UCSB Library opened its new building in January 2016.

The original Davidson Library was built in 1954, and it was intended to be the geographical center of the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>The new building is considerably more modern and features drop-lighting, a new transfer center, expanded seating areas and a café open during daylight hours.</p>\n<p>Since the building’s reconstruction, the university has also hired staff members to push the facility into a new era of technology.  This summer, Thomas Padilla came onboard as the first ever humanities data curator in the UC system. Padilla works with humanities departments which can vary in data usage from traditional S.T.E.M. fields.</p>\n<p>New Mac computers also made their debut in the Learning Commons earlier this summer, which are now the only Mac computers available on campus for general student use.</p>\n<p>Funding for the computers came from the library’s budget, mostly made up of state money and private donations. The library also plans to use $30,000 to $40,000 from the Class of 2016 senior class gift to install additional technology.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Jan.

id=\"caption-attachment-74948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kathleen Slavaty</p></div>\n<p>Kathleen Salvaty will be appointed the new system-wide Title IX coordinator for the University of California, the UC Office of the President announced last Thursday.</p>\n<p>The UCOP released a statement on Jan. 12 saying Salvaty, who currently works as Title IX Coordinator for UCLA, will fill the position on Feb. 6.</p>\n<p>Salvaty worked as an attorney for 15 years and is licensed to practice law in California and New York. She emphasized that her appointment will focus on creating a transparent system to address Title IX reports.</p>\n<p>She and UC President Janet Napolitano will be working together closely, according to a press release from the UCOP.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Salvaty said, “I think that the president’s recommendations, those that she’s adopted, are right on … I think we share the same goal, which is to improve accountability and fairness and transparency.”</p>\n<p>The recommendations, which are available on the UC website and are approved by UC President Napolitano, outline plans to make examining Title IX cases uniform.</p>\n<p>The document lists the creation of a proper investigation method for matters of sexual violence and sexual harassment. It states that Title IX will create “clear time frames” so that investigations take no longer than three months and adjudication takes no longer than two months unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”</p>\n<p>In reference to the implementation of uniform Title IX procedures, Salvaty acknowledged that the challenge in creating consistent processes will be respecting the unique qualities of each campus.</p>\n<p>“I think the consistent challenge, certainly in the context of our students, is trying to implement a fair process that all the students understand, that they feel comfortable accessing if that’s their choice,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>The UC’s recommendations insist on uniform procedures for handling Title IX cases, which Salvaty said are meant to create an equitable way of handling cases.</p>\n<p>“We are one system, we are one UC, and certainly the president and I would want all our students to experience the most fair process that we can build,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>“A key to that would be that that process looks the same on every campus,” she added. “It wouldn’t be fair if a student at UC San Diego experienced the Title IX process totally different than a student at Santa Cruz.”</p>\n<p>As a new presidency brings changes to federal administration, there is uncertainty whether the Obama administration’s interpretation of Title IX will be upheld. The current standard relies on the relatively lenient “preponderance of evidence,” 50.1 percent chance that the accused is responsible.</p>\n<p>In response to these changes, Salvaty says that the “obligation to take care of our students remains,” regardless of new administration.</p>\n<p>“I think we all agree that no one wants their students experiencing sexual violence. The question is: How do we build a fair process where we can ensure that we’re taking care of all of our students?” she said. “I don’t see the incoming administration changing … that fundamental obligation that the universities have.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74978\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74978\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/","id":3601,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3600,3599,3598],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tax Proposed To Fund I.V.

With approximately 8,377 bedrooms and 215,862 square feet of commercial space in Isla Vista, IVRPD officials estimate the special tax could add $256,348.43 in annual tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, IVRPD will levy the tax for the next 10 years after June 2017. Registered voters will receive mail-in ballots 29 days before May 9, and the measure must attain a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>Property owners currently pay an annual rate of approximately $93 in special taxes. IVRPD runs on a $1.5 million budget.</p>\n<p>Rodney Gould, IVRPD general manager, said the additional special taxes could help pay for more park services, especially since the measure directs at least 50 percent of the tax revenue for capital improvements. He said IVRPD will then be able to address the “backlog of deferred maintenance” in I.V.’s parks.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Board Chair Pegeen Soutar said she hopes the increase in funds could bring reclaimed water into I.V. through a contract with the Goleta West Sanitary District.</p>\n<p>Soutar first proposed the special tax measure in February 2016 in light of two key factors.</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District proposed in April 2015 to proportionally raise water rates by drought level. According to Soutar, this means a $30,000 water bill would increase to $60,000.</p>\n<p>IVRPD officials also foresaw a decrease in tax revenue after the university purchased Tropicana Gardens in July 2015, an Isla Vista residence hall previously owned by a Chicago investor. UCSB is exempt from paying taxes for the property that it owns in I.V. due to state law.</p>\n<p>Despite the decrease in tax revenue, however, the university reached an agreement in which it pays IVRPD the amount lost in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, Isla Vista property owners will be paying the same amount on property taxes as in the 2015-16 fiscal year.</p>\n<p>As of now, property owners pay less on property taxes for the 2016-17 fiscal year because of a land ownership bond that ended in June 2016, paid back like a loan. IVRPD initially levied a property tax to purchase land in I.V., but it effectively paid off the bond in June 2016, and the tax is no longer implemented.</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the special tax is the same amount that property owners were paying to fund the bond. Thus, if the tax measure passes, property owners will see no change in their taxes from the previous fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“They carefully crafted this,” said Joan Hartmann, the chair of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors who consented to the special election. She suggested that because the tax rates are so similar, “this new tax is just a continuation of what people were already paying.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said she originally wanted to put the special tax on the June 2016 ballot, but was unable to get it organized in time. She and other board members then intended to add the measure to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>This plan soon came to a halt last summer, however, after organizers from Yes on E&amp;F — the campaign which sought to establish a Community Services District (CSD) and a utility users tax in Isla Vista — asked the IVRPD board not to add the property tax to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, one of the Yes on E&amp;F organizers, said they didn’t want to have two tax measures on the same ballot. This would have increased the likelihood of both measures failing, he said.</p>\n<p>Paola Dela Cruz, IVRPD board vice chair, said, however, that organizers were being detrimental to the community engagement process in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I thought that our conversations were already hurting relationships and were hurting our future engagement,” Dela Cruz said. “I was seeing, I think, some level of disrespect. I was seeing lack of collaboration.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said Measure F (the utility users tax measure) and the IVRPD special tax could have both passed, but the board ultimately opted to postpone for a later date.</p>\n<p>“IVRPD needs to be able to work with everybody,” she said. “I didn’t want the Park District to be the blame if [Measure] F failed.”</p>\n<p>The IVRPD special tax did not appear on the November ballot. Measure F <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\" target=\"_blank\">did not pass</a> on Election Day.</p>\n<p>Soutar told the Nexus on Tuesday that she foresees no opposition to the special tax, since the tax is no “additional burden” on property owners and since people are “partial to their parks.”</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can tailor this election to what’s strictly positive,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74980\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74980\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/","id":4661,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4660,4659,4658],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Soon To Be 6700 Sabado","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Representatives from Santa Barbara County announced Thursday that the county will be installing a continuous sidewalk through Sabado Tarde Road in the spring.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74938\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74938\" data-attachment-id=\"74938\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/sabado-by-pei-chiao-lin/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sabado-by-pei-chiao-lin\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74938\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"The project is funded by both the Santa Barbara County Community Development Block Grant Program and UCSB, and it will cost $750,000.

The project aims to make Isla Vista and its roads more pedestrian-friendly. <em>Pei Chiao Lin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Representatives from Santa Barbara County announced Thursday that the county will be installing a continuous sidewalk through Sabado Tarde Road in the spring.</p>\n<p>According to Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, the county will add more sidewalks on the 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road. Curb ramps will be placed in several intersections along Sueno Road.</p>\n<p>Residents of these parts of Sabado Tarde Road will not have to wait long for the completion of this project. McGolpin projects it will be underway in the beginning of this spring, and he estimates construction will take approximately three months.</p>\n<p>This project, which bears a cost of $750,000, is being funded equally by the Santa Barbara County Community Development Block Grant Program and UC Santa Barbara. Each is allocating $2 million for this project and similar public works projects in the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>According to George Thurlow, UCSB special assistant for Isla Vista affairs, the project is part of the “joint county-university” safety improvements in Isla Vista. He said the University has pledged $2 million over the next 10 years to be matched by the county for sidewalks, streetlights and traffic improvements.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to have sidewalks on at least one side of all the streets in Isla Vista,” he said.</p>\n<p>The project is a continuation of an effort by the Santa Barbara Public Works Department to make Isla Vista more pedestrian-friendly. It was preceded by sidewalk installment projects on Del Playa Drive and Sueno Road throughout the last several years.</p>\n<p>“The community originally didn’t have sidewalks,” McGolpin said. “It takes time and money, and we’re slowly chipping away at it.”</p>\n<p>As of now, continuous sidewalks are sparse in Isla Vista. The county installed a long stretch of sidewalks along Del Playa Drive in 2002, and other streets have received segments of sidewalks over the following years. There are still many blocks in Isla Vista that do not have a consistent stretch of sidewalk.</p>\n<p>“Normally in California the way sidewalks get constructed is when you have an area that is going to be developed, you decide you want sidewalks and then you require developers to provide a sidewalk in front of their section of land,” said Jay Freeman, an 18-year Isla Vista resident and board member of the Isla Vista Community Services District.</p>\n<p>However, this was not the case during the development of Isla Vista. Although certain houses in the designated area of Sabado Tarde Road already have a sidewalk in front of them, they were installed during housing redevelopment.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said the project seeks to change this so that every house on these blocks has a sidewalk without having to redevelop properties.</p>\n<p>Another motive for this sidewalk project is to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Dela Cruz, a fourth-year history of public policy major, was also reelected to the board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD board votes on these two positions annually. Each board member was also reelected to their respective standing committees, which include the Personnel, Finance and Policy &amp; Ordinance committees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board encourages members from the community to participate in the committees. According to the meeting minutes, a request for “letters of interest” from community members who wish to join the committees will be published next week, and submissions will be considered at the board meeting planned for Feb. 6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD board also discussed their application for grants from the Coastal Grant Fund. The fund is comprised of Associated Students (A.S.) student fees and is available for all coastal improvements in the Isla Vista and Goleta area, particularly in communities with low accessibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two grant amounts: “major” grants for projects estimated to cost more than $1,000 and “minor” grants for projects costing less. The board is primarily focused on applying for the major grants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Daniel Torres, who was elected to the board in November, the IVRPD board would use the grant money for one of several community projects. The board discussed the possibility of installing more community gardens at Estero Park or “expanding” Sueno Orchard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are a lot of ecosystems [at the Sueno Orchard] that aren’t native to our ecosystem, so we want to do a lot of work to pursue those,” Torres said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div
