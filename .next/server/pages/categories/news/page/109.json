At Friday’s event, representatives discussed conditions in North Korea, the challenges of escaping the country and how the organization aids refugees.</p>\n<p>LINK member John Park said North Koreans are “just like you and me” but come from very different circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There’s 24 million people in North Korea, full of hopes, dreams, families and relationships,” Park said. “The only difference is between here and there; they are living in one of the most suppressive countries in this world today.”</p>\n<p>Park said the Kim dynasty has convinced North Korean citizens of a “different reality.”</p>\n<p>“They tell them that the outside world is full of stress and enemies and they have to put their faith in their leaders,” Park said. “Their regime puts forth incredible time and resources to make people believe in their strict version of socialism.”</p>\n<p>According to Park, the North Korean government controls its citizens through censorship and isolation.<br>\n“To prevent their people from seeing the outside world, North Korea has an information and media blockade,” Park said. “They cannot make international phone calls, they are banned from foreign radio or watching foreign television.”</p>\n<p>Park said there is little resistance to the Kim dynasty’s rule because of the severe penalties in place for dissonance.</p>\n<p>“If you are suspected of defying the regime, they conduct harsh interrogation with you and your entire family and may place you in a political prison camp,” Park said. “The estimated number is 80 to 120 thousand people kept in these prisons, including entire families. We’ve heard the regime uses torture, starvation, and even execution in order to keep people in line.”</p>\n<p>According to Park, thousands of North Koreans have escaped to China since the 1990s as a form of “quiet disobedience.”</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the direct travel to South Korea is blocked by the DMZ, the Demilitarized Zone, so thousands of North Koreans travel to China,” Park said. “But even if they make it to China, the Chinese government does not recognize North Koreans as refugees.”</p>\n<p>Park said if refugees are caught by the Chinese government, they are deported to North Korea where they may face forced labor and torture.</p>\n<p>“If they get caught, they will be sent back, and there, they will be faced with grave punishments for leaving the government,” Park said.</p>\n<p>North Korean refugee Min Sung said the challenges and potential consequences refugees face are better than continuing to live in suppression.</p>\n<p>“You only live on Earth once; I want to live it in freedom,” Sung said.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi member and second-year undeclared major Athena Wan said she hopes people who attended the event will support LINK in the future.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wanted to bring this organization to my campus, and I finally did it in college because I feel like it’s a really good organization and, like, they have a really great cause,” Athena said. “Since we have the materials to help them with, I feel like we should all try to participate. I hope this event spreads awareness on their cause and their organization.”</p>\n<p>KASA member and third-year sociology major Samantha Chang said she applauds LINK’s mission.</p>\n<p>“I’m glad to see a group is doing something to potentially be political but doing it for the people,” Chang said. “I feel like it’s hard to convey a non-political stance these days. So their efforts to resettle North Korean refugees is really amazing.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year anthropology major Connie Kim said the event helped her further understand the challenges North Koreans face.</p>\n<p>“I just knew that it was hard living in North Korea and they didn’t have rights, but I feel more informed,” Kim said.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Peter Dang said although the issues discussed at the event are geographically distant, the UCSB community should participate in a solution.</p>\n<p>“We can still make a difference and be able to make life better for people that we will never meet and for a cause that is important to those people,” Dang said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/","id":4614,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[4613,4612,4611],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yoga Studio Opens in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Yoga_by-Vivian-Bui-1-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Yoga_by-Vivian-Bui-1-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Yoga Isla Vista opened Saturday above Silvergreens at 900 Embarcadero del Mar, with a studio opening and blessing ceremony hosted by cofounders John Smart, a UCSB alum, and Julie Smart.

The grand opening included a demonstration of a Kundalini yoga class for attendees and performances by Sukhdev Jackson of the musical group Aykanna and local singer and songwriter Gabriel Kelly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident and Yin Yoga instructor at Yoga Isla Vista Dolliane Lipman said the studio will offer an opportunity for I.V. residents to participate in a neighborhood activity.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really great idea to have a yoga community in Isla Vista, just somewhere people can come and … heal, because there’s a lot of negative stuff that’s happened here,” Lipman said.</p>\n<p>Yoga instructor at Yoga Isla Vista Peter Stephan said many of the instructors connect deeply to Kundalini yoga, a tradition Yogi Bhajan brought to the west in 1968. According to Stephan, Kundalini yoga focuses on conscious experience.</p>\n<p>“Kundalini is the yoga of awareness, there’s a real emphasis on the community… and it incorporates all the other styles of yoga,” Stephan said. “Kundalini is all about the direct, personal experience.”<br>\nStephan said he encourages students and I.V. residents to try yoga even if they are unsure about the activity.</p>\n<p>“My advice would be to show up and experience the technology. It’s a science because there are steps that, if taken, give guaranteed results. It’s simply about taking those steps,” Stephan said. “This science can help us dissolve the illusion of who we think we are.”</p>\n<p>Smart, who graduated from UCSB in 2003, said he began yoga to seek relief from a hectic career in the film industry.</p>\n<p>“My first passion in life was surfing, I was a semi-professional/professional surfer. And when I went off into the real world to get a job in the film industry… I wasn’t getting the same physical activity that I got through surfing,” Smart said. “So I first came to yoga to help me deal with working 12, 14, 18-hour days. It was the most strenuous job I could have dreamed of.”</p>\n<p>Smart said yoga helped bring calm to his life and inspired him to open his own studio.</p>\n<p>“That was a lot of stress for the body, mind, and spirit. So, trying to finding a balance there, I just had to have a personal practice,” Smart said. “That’s how I found yoga and a daily practice, to counterbalance that chaos,” Smart said.</p>\n<p>Smart said while he and the instructors have roots in Kundalini yoga, Yoga Isla Vista will offer many styles of yoga to best serve each individual.</p>\n<p>“We’re not just doing Kundalini, we’re doing all different types, because we believe that everybody has a different path. We just want to offer authentic forms of yoga; we’re not a corporate yoga, it’s not a gym workout,” Smart said. “We’re just offering a slice of different traditions, so the community and students within it can be exposed to it and gravitate towards whatever tradition they like.”</p>\n<p>According to Smart, Kundalini yoga helps individuals attain a flowing mindset rather than a fixed one, and encourages people to follow their intuitions.</p>\n<p>“To me, we can approach life in two ways. One is, ‘my way or the highway.’ The other is to surrender to the flow and that natural, tiny voice that’s saying ‘go this way, don’t go that way,’” Smart said. “That’s the voice we’re trying to listen to, that passionate, energetic guide.”</p>\n<p>Smart said his goal is to share the yogic tradition rather than control it, and encourages campus clubs to continue their activities.</p>\n<p>“We’re not here to monopolize yoga; that’s totally against the tradition. The idea is that it spreads,” Smart said.</p>\n<p>Smart said he hopes the studio will impact I.V. in a positive, life-changing way.</p>\n<p>“The whole purpose was to give this community and college kids the tools they need for life … and there’s certain things that aren’t taught in school, unfortunately,” Smart said. “So that they have it in their tool kit, so they can live happier, healthier, holier lives — ‘holy’ meaning kind, loving, compassionate, realizing you’re part of a bigger whole and you’re grateful for that.”</p>\n<p>First-year financial mathematics and statistics major Caroline Cubero said yoga is a source of tranquility for her during stressful times, and the she wants to look into taking classes at the studio.</p>\n<p>“I did yoga over the summer, and it really calms me down. It helps me get all of my stress out and I feel so much better at the end of the day. Especially if I’m having a really bad day, it helps to reduce my stress. I definitely want to check it out,” Cubero said.</p>\n<p>Kundalini Yoga student Cy Cascade said setting aside inhibitions with an open mind is the first step to benefiting from yoga.</p>\n<p>“When you first come to class, you’re gonna be greeted by your teacher, who probably doesn’t look like a typical yoga teacher in the spandex or yoga pants,” Cascade said. “You have to let go of your preconceived notions that ‘this is weird’…you have to get past yourself. Which opens you up to being available to experience the amazing rewards.”</p>\n<p>Classes at Yoga Isla Vista will begin Monday, Nov. 2 with a special two-week student trial period for $25.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65769\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/yoga-studio-opens-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65769\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/yoga-studio-opens-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/yoga-studio-opens-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/yoga-studio-opens-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/yoga-studio-opens-in-isla-vista/","id":4610,"author":{"id":252,"name":"Madison Willard"},"related":[4609,4608,4607],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"La Escuelita and IVRPD Host Safe Halloween Event","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Safe-Halloween-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Safe-Halloween-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Campus organization La Escuelita and Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) hosted Safe Halloween Saturday at Children’s Park.

More than a dozen organizations collaborated to put on the event with activities like face painting, bounce house and Halloween-themed games.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and fourth-year math and Spanish double major Sonia Acuna said the annual event provides a fun and safe place for local children to enjoy Halloween.</p>\n<p>“It’s a tradition to have it every year, to have a safe space for children to come play and celebrate Halloween,” Acuna said. “Obviously, in Isla Vista it isn’t always the best place to go trick-or-treating on Halloween night, so we try to bring it to them even though it’s the weekend before.”</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and fourth-year statistics major Jose Neri said students often forget there are many families who live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Halloween in I.V. is very party-like, and it’s not a very ideal place for kids to go trick-or-treating,” Neri said. “Also, most students here don’t have candy to give out to little kids, so that’s why we do this for the little kids.”</p>\n<p>Acuna said Safe Halloween is made possible through the support of local organizations.</p>\n<p>“We invited them all to have a booth or little activity for the kids to play and have fun,” Acuna said. “It’s really awesome to have them here. There’s about 15 or 16 orgs here right now… it fills up the park and it feels nice to have their support here.”</p>\n<p>Lambda Theta Alpha member and third-year Chican@ studies major Cristina Cota said she and her sorority sisters were “excited to participate” in Safe Halloween.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really great opportunity for children who don’t really have access to the typical Halloween trick-or-treating experience in their neighborhood that you would see on T.V. or that you grow up with in a hometown,” Cota said.</p>\n<p>Acuna said IVRPD, Community Affairs Board (CAB), and Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) contributed funds to Safe Halloween.</p>\n<p>“[IVRPD] covered a fee of about almost $300,” Acuna said. “We’re here because they helped us with that. I know CAB is donating money as well and IVCRC is also donating money, so this is possible with a lot of help from IVRPD, CAB and IVCRC.”</p>\n<p>Cota said it is important for students to be involved

Cota said. “It’s really important for us to really nurture that and make sure that they get the best experience that they can, and it’s not just about coming here just to go to school, it’s also about

id=\"caption-attachment-65715\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Neil Yanga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Assistant Professor in the Department of Government at Cornell University Adam Seth Levine hosted a seminar titled “Citizen Engagement (and Disengagement) in Response to Climate Change” to discuss the communication of climate change at Bren Hall Thursday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Levine presented research on how personalizing information about environmental issues affects people’s attitudes. Levine’s research is based on an experiment in which he gave sheets presenting the issue of climate change to different subject groups with varying degrees of urgency and observed which participants chose to sign a petition in support of political action on climate change. He found those who received more personalized, urgent information were less likely to want to engage in a solution.</p>\n<p>Levine said people become less willing to conserve resources when climate change is presented as an urgent, personalized issue.</p>\n<p>“It might have cognitive consequences which might decrease the belief that because the really important goal is difficult to achieve, perhaps what I need to do is conserve my resources to focus on those goals,” Levine said. “What we are finding is that seemingly helpful rhetoric can backfire in [a] really important and consequential way, and that it is important to highlight that,” Levine said.</p>\n<p>Bren Environmental Science and Management (EMS) graduate student Michelle Graff said Levine’s research contradicted her preexisting ideas.</p>\n<p>“It is a belief that you should make things more personal because somebody can find those connections,” Graff said. “So I did think it was really interesting that sometimes that actually does the exact opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to Graff, using fear tactics to motivate people to act on environmental issues is ineffective.</p>\n<p>“There has generally been a shift in climate change communication to it being a doomsday kind of thing,” Graff said. “It will be difficult, but there are ways to approach it in a manageable way — more of focusing on people’s ability of what they can get done.”</p>\n<p>Bren EMS graduate student Tova Handelman said Levine’s research reveals why people are often pessimistic about environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“Maybe one of the reasons that the messaging against climate change has been so effective [is] because it kind of gives people the option to not do anything about it” Handelman said.</p>\n<p>Sierra Club member Robert Bernstein said Levine’s research is “priceless.”</p>\n<p>“Somebody has actually done evidential research on what it is that motivates people to do environmental action,” Bernstein said.</p><div

emergency contraceptive company Plan B One-Step Thursday in front of the UCen to educate students about various birth control options.</p>\n<p>The “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative serves to promote the emergency contraceptive Plan B One-Step through events held at college campuses throughout the country. At UCSB’s event, students had the chance to learn information about various contraceptive options, participate in a photo booth and interact with MTV series “Girl Code” celebrities Carly Aquilino and Nessa Diab. Aquilino, Diab and Obstetrician and Gynecologist Dr. Diana Ramos spoke about the campaign and Plan B One-Step, followed by a Q&amp;A session at a media event in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies and sociology double major Kevin Tang said he is happy to see a campus event on sexual education.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s really good that it’s on campus because I feel like our country just doesn’t give people the sex education that they need, so I think it’s a good resource to be on campus,” Tang said.</p>\n<p>Third-year communication and global studies double major Natasha Mehrdad said Her Campus’s involvement in the campaign emphasized the theme of female empowerment.</p>\n<p>“The fact that Her Campus is involved with all of it brings back the whole feminist ‘girl power’ vibe to it,” Mehrdad said. “They are all so open and welcoming and all that stuff.

Dr. Ramos said the active ingredient in the Plan B One-Step is levonorgestrel, a manufactured hormone in a class of medications called progestins.</p>\n<p>“87 percent of the women’s survey believe that emergency contraception will harm the existing pregnancy, and the reality is it will not — as a matter of fact, it helps prevent a pregnancy,” Dr. Ramos said. “So, it’s really important to realize that it works similar to the way birth control [works], but you’ve got one hormone at a much higher dose, so it is not an abortive agent.”</p>\n<p>Diab said it is important to make self-image decisions based off of facts and evidence, not societal pressures.</p>\n<p>“We live in a world right now where we’re being judged all the time — there’s so much pressure from day to day,” Diab said. “When you have this pressure to constantly be perfect, you might make decisions based off pressure and … that’s why it’s important to be true to yourself … to be prepared for situations like this and to accept the fact that we’re not perfect.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Associate Professor of Sociology at Indiana University Dina Okamoto gave a lecture titled “Asian American Panethnicity and Shifting Ethnic Boundaries” Thursday at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) to discuss Asian-American identity throughout history.</p>\n<p>Okamoto spoke about Asian ethnic groups in the United States and how various social and cultural forces led to the creation of the panethnic Asian-American group, a term and identity used to describe Americans from all Asian backgrounds.</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, Asian ethnic groups in America did not organize to form a shared panethnic identity until 1968.</p>\n<p>“Before 1968, the legal identity of Asian Americans was divided, with representatives from China, Japan, Korea,” Okamoto said. “They didn’t form alliances — instead they formed their own separate ethnic communities with their own systems of social assistance and support, and at times they intentionally distinguished themselves from one another.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto also said there are a variety of differences between Asian ethnic groups, preventing the formation of a unified group prior to 1968. According to Okamoto, social, religious and economic factors contributed to separations between Asian immigrant groups in America.</p>\n<p>“They spoke different languages; they brought different cultural traditions with them from their homeland; they also practiced different religions. This is something that still happens today,” Okamoto said. “I would also argue that during this period different ethnic groups didn’t work together in the fields … because they arrived in successive waves to the United States. When one group fell out of favor, another group came to meet the labor demand.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, a new Asian-American identity formed in the 1960s when Asian-Americans sought involvement in the black power movement, the anti-war movement and protests at UC Berkeley and San Francisco State for ethnic studies programs.</p>\n<p>“Asian American students and community activists began to realize their unique position and perspective, and they created an identity that encompassed all Asian origin groups,” Okamoto said. “They rejected the label ‘oriental’ because it represented the European colonialist view and instead adopted the identity of Asian-American.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto said the creation of a panethnic group like Asian-American does not replace individual ethnic groups such as Chinese and Korean-Americans.</p>\n<p>“I argue that when panethnicity occurs — when ethnic backgrounds expand to other groups and an all encompassing identity — this doesn’t necessarily mean that boundaries have been displaced or attenuated,” Okamoto said. “Instead, the boundaries can have a layered quality where multiple identities can coexist and even be complimentary.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, the creation of panethnic groups allows immigrant groups to build new, powerful communities.</p>\n<p>“By trying to alter widely agreed-upon racial categories through organizing, Asian-Americans have attempted to change the meaning of these racial categories,” Okamoto said. “By doing this, immigrant groups can create new forms of community and identity and can call for shifts in the current distribution of resources.”</p>\n<p>MCC program director Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said Okamoto was invited to the MCC’s “Race Matters” series to emphasize a theme of intersectionality and bring a new perspective to the MCC.</p>\n<p>“The logic of the ‘Race Matters’ series is to bring a diverse group of academic experts working in various fields that intersect with race in one form or another,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “We wanted a representative from the Asian-American community to bring diversity and variance to the MCC, and Dina Okamoto’s work is very cutting edge, and she’s an incredible sociologist.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Arpan Singh said she enjoyed hearing about Asian-American involvement in the 1960s protest movement.</p>\n<p>“I liked how she explained the different perspectives in the protest movement,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Annie Hikido said issues of Asian American identity are especially relevant in California.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important, particularly in California, [which] does have an incredibly large Asian American population that is increasing both as a general race and as the ethnicities within it,” Hikido said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life, highlighted recent social justice issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement, student activism and two of Dees’ most notable lawsuits against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Dees earned a law degree from the University of Alabama in 1960, after which he founded the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, a nonprofit legal advocacy specializing in civil rights and combating hate and intolerance. In 2006, the National Law Journal included Dees in its list of the top 100 most influential lawyers in America.</p>\n<p>Dees said some people feel threatened by the increase of diversity in American in recent years.</p>\n<p>“It seems like America’s changed a lot in 15 years. This changing demographics and what it portends for the next 20, 30 years, it’s creating an enormous fear — a fear for those people who felt that they were privileged,” Dees said.</p>\n<p>According to Dees, “xenophobia” becomes more prevalent as cultures mix. Providing an example of this, Dees said he once represented Vietnamese fishermen after white fishermen mistreated them in Houston, Texas in 1981.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t long before they were out-fishing the American fishermen,” Dees said. “There’s no other way to put it but the American fishermen got jealous.”</p>\n<p>Dees said the white fishermen enlisted the help of the KKK, but he won the case on behalf of the Vietnamese one day before the shrimping season began, at which time the United States Marshals began protecting the Vietnamese fishermen.</p>\n<p>Dees said a television network that “starts with the letter F” spreads distorted information in order to create a reactionary response that spreads hate and intolerance.</p>\n<p>“We have mainstream hate in America and it’s because of these changing demographics,” Dees said. “America is great because of its diversity, not in spite of it.”</p>\n<p>Dees said he is disappointed by how popular Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has become and disapproves of his plan to deport millions of immigrants.</p>\n<p>“It’s saddening that the American public would buy into this,” Dees said. “Facts don’t seem to matter when you have a demigod leading the pack.”</p>\n<p>According to Dees, “98 percent of police officers” in the United States are good people, but Americans, especially racial minorities, are being victimized by the remaining two percent.</p>\n<p>“Innocent African-Americans and others are being shot by trigger-happy police officers,” Dees said.</p>\n<p>Walter H. Capps Center Public Service Intern and fourth-year global studies major Lindsay Apperson said Dees’ activism is inspiring, especially given his continued work at the age of 78.</p>\n<p>“He has done so much incredible social work and empowered a lot of marginalized populations,” Apperson said. “He’s … still fighting court cases against injustices.

Senate passes bills to establish student councils, redefine S.T.A.R.K. funds, and create a digital database. <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students (A.S) Senate met Wednesday evening in the Flying A Room in the UCen to discuss three bills.</p>\n<p>Senate voted on and passed “A Bill to Establish a Student Council for the College of Creative Studies (CCS) and College of Engineering (CoE)” and “A Bill to Reform the Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) Fund” and moved “A Bill to Promote Increased Transparency in A.S.” to the Campus Affairs Committee. Public forum included first-year CCS music composition major Jordan Mitchell and Senate Coordinator and Director of Accountability Michelle May. Senators also provided a report of the “Breakfast with Librarians.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell said he supports the creation of the CCS and CoE student council to improve campus representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“It is within our rights as an underrepresented college to be equally represented in university and student affairs at UCSB,” Mitchell said. “It will provide crucial space for CCS representation, helping [allow us] to do much more things.”</p>\n<p>May said each senator must fulfill their senate responsibilities as outlined in the A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>“You all must undertake four or five projects this year,” May said.  “And one must be a group project.”</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President and fourth-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian, senators had previously discussed the potential features of the new library space during the “Breakfast with Librarians” event.</p>\n<p>“The students wanted more outlets, so we are giving them outlets.” Hashemian said. “Another thing they’re really interested in — Senator [Jerel] Constantino brought this up — is e-books, so e-coursereaders, since textbook affordability is number one in their priority.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan said she talked with librarians about creating resource centers, such as a space for mental health services in the library.</p>\n<p>“There’s going to be a transfer center in the inside of the library,” Jordan said. “They were super unwilling to have C.A.P.S. [Counseling &amp; Psychological Services] — they wanted it to be strictly a study space.”</p>\n<p>The consent calendar was passed during this meeting, which included “A Bill to Create a Self-Care Portion for the Declaration of Candidacy Meeting,” “A Resolution to Create a Group Project For the Alternative Transportation Project,” “A Resolution to Create an Ad-Hoc Committee to Fill the Vacant On-Campus Senator Positions” and “A Resolution in Support of a Student Advisor Position to the UC Board of Regents and UC Regent Avi Oved’s Shared Governance Proposals.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy and political science double-major Jerel Constantino presented Austin Hechler’s bill “A Resolution to Make A.S. More Transparent,” which outlines the plan to improve A.S transparency through creating a digital database for important documents, including reports, minutes, bills, resolutions, projects and other related documents.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 12 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Plan B One-Step pill. <em>Courtesy of Her Campus UCSB</em></p></div>\n<p>Her Campus at UC Santa Barbara is hosting an event at the University Center (UCen) Thursday in conjunction with contraceptive company Plan B One-Step, titled the “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative to educate students on contraception.</p>\n<p>The event will be from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and MTV “Girl Code” stars Carly Aquilino and Nessa Diab will speak about their personal experiences, while health professionals will also be lecturing on important information to know concerning contraception. The nation-wide campaign, sponsored by Plan B One-Step, aims to educate women about their reproductive health and the various methods of contraception that are available to them.</p>\n<p>UCSB Her Campus Campus Correspondent and third-year environmental studies major Helen Gannon said the primary objective of the event is to educate women on the emergency contraceptive Plan B, which is usually taken when other forms of birth control fail.</p>\n<p>“The main point is to make sure these women are educated in case their birth control plans do not go as perfectly as they had originally planned,” Gannon said in an email. “The initiative wants women to be true to themselves, without having the need to feel perfect, and do what they feel is right, to them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Her Campus Campus Correspondent and fourth-year English major Kirby Beaton said she hopes the “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative will help spread information about reproductive health to students who may have difficulty finding resources about Plan B.</p>\n<p>“I think this event will educate students about their options when it comes to reproductive health and that being imperfect is perfectly okay,” Beaton said in an email. “It will also be a way to engage with students through the photo booth and free goodies that our team will be offering!”</p>\n<p>Her Campus’s National team Campus Development Associate Cara Chiaramonte said the relatable experiences of the “Girl Code” stars will attract students to the event.</p>\n<p>“Carly and Nessa have imperfections just like the rest of us, and they’re letting college women know that it’s okay to embrace them,” Chiaramonte said in an email. “College women relate to other women who can be real and get on their level so I think having them on an initiative like this is perfect — no pun intended.”</p>\n<p>According to Chiaramonte, students from other universities have responded positively to the “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative.</p>\n<p>“Students have been flocking to our awesome photo booth during the day to share what makes them Perfectly Imperfect,” Chiaramonte said in an email. “Student and local media outlets have been debunking common myths about emergency contraception at night.”</p>\n<p>Chiaramonte said she wants the audience to feel comfortable in their own skin, embrace their flaws and understand the options available to them when things do not go according to “plan.”</p>\n<p>“Our Her Campus chapter here at UCSB has worked extremely hard planning this event and bringing it to share with the UCSB community,” Chiaramonte said in an email. “We can’t wait to see it come to life!”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

and drought sustainability. <em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB is participating in the UC-wide #UCool Campus Challenge from Oct. 6 to Dec. 10 in an effort to reduce the University’s carbon footprint and make positive contributions to the environment.</p>\n<p>University of California and UC Berkeley’s Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory created #UCool with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. The campaign, modeled after the Cool California Cities Challenge, encourages students to accumulate points for each university by completing 50 online pledge challenges. The pledges include energy efficient moves such as switching to LED lighting and turning off computer monitors. Participants will have opportunities to win eco-efficient prizes such as solar-powered cellphone chargers, and the university with the highest score will be deemed the “Coolest UC Campus.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Chris Berry said the challenge will require a large amount of student participation to be effective, but he hopes the goal of carbon neutrality will be reached.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really cool campaign, and [with] more incentive for students to do it, it could be meaningful,” Berry said. “If we really are interested in [achieving] carbon neutrality, the school can do all they can, but if you have students who don’t care and don’t do work, we’re not going to achieve that goal.”</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-chair and third-year computer science and environmental studies double-major Nicholas Frey said the most difficult part of the #UCool challenge is encouraging students to participate in the event.</p>\n<p>“One of the harder challenges is changing people’s behavior on things,” Frey said. “One of the major issues is getting the student population engaged and educated on how they can be sustainable in their actions.”</p>\n<p>According to Frey, UCSB needs total student and faculty involvement for the campaign to achieve the 2025 goal.</p>\n<p>“I think you need infrastructure change, so you need to be, like, adding solar on campus to make it carbon neutral, but I don’t think it’s totally possible if you don’t have faculty and student engagement,” Frey said. “The whole campus can’t become carbon neutral if it’s just the facilities; it has to be the people also.”</p>\n<p>Frey said students should contribute anything they can to the challenge even if they cannot be consistent in their actions.</p>\n<p>“[A misconception] is that you have to be absolutely perfect, and if you slip up you’ll be criticized. That’s not the point; people shouldn’t feel … discouraged to be sustainable,” Frey said. “We don’t live in a world where being some perfect hippie environmentalist is even possible. I just encourage people to learn and explore.”</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students Environmental Program Director Sarah Siedschlag, UCSB has already made great strides towards becoming more environmentally friendly.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has done a lot. For a research university of our size, we’re actually very good in water conservation … the vast majority of our landscape is done with recycled water,” Siedschlag said. “We are prepared, or becoming prepared, for a situation in the future where we might just have longer and longer droughts.”<br>\nSiedschlag said she hopes the Cool Campus Challenge will encourage students and faculty to “engage as groups” in efforts toward environmental conservation.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that it gets students to think about it and also makes it something that people talk about and is part of their daily lives, and that people don’t just do themselves but encourage their friends to do,” Siedschlag said. “I think that’s what’s really fun — people are building teams with the Cool Campus Challenge and getting really competitive about it.”</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UC achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 is an attainable goal.</p>\n<p>“I think it depends on what you include and how far you are willing to go,” Siedschlag said.</p>\n<p>According to professor of sociology John Foran, the environment is the “defining issue” of the century.</p>\n<p>“The biggest issue is climate change. It is the biggest existential threat to humanity ever because it calls the whole future into question,” Foran said. “We really have to make deep, deep changes in the ways we organize ourselves in society.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, converting to a vegetarian or vegan diet is “without question, the single most important” factor in reducing students’ carbon footprint. Foran said the Cool Campus Challenge should emphasize the importance of this change.</p>\n<p>“This is an important thing to underline: the UC Cool Campus Challenge and the perspective of the impact of food, diet and individual behavior change,” Foran said. “The Campus Challenge, as good as it is, needs to be recalibrated to the reality of that. That is good for climate, that is good for our health, pollution, good for the oceans, and it’s good for reducing inequality on a global scale.”</p>\n<p>Berry also said he believes food choices have a very real effect on the environment.</p>\n<p>“One of the biggest things [affecting] environmental climate change is how we eat, and Americans really enjoy meat, and meat is detrimental to the environment, especially in the way it is produced,” Berry said.</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UCSB has a good chance at winning the challenge because of student and faculty dedication to the environment.</p>\n<p>“I think we do have a good chance,” Siedschlag said. “We’ve got a lot of really dedicated students and a lot of groups that have gotten really into it, there’s still plenty of time left, and I think we can definitely do it.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65679\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65679\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/","id":2672,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2671,2670,2669],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Professor at UCSB To Give T.E.D.

Talks Live in New York City on Nov. 2 in Town Hall Theater to discuss the “Education Revolution.”</p>\n<p>The talk will focus on reforming education curriculums in public schools to better serve marginalized, “at-promise” students. Rios said he was motivated by his personal journey in overcoming adversities to research the education systems within public schools and their effects on marginalized students.</p>\n<p>According to Rios, the T.E.D. Talk will focus on his work in developing a curriculum for high school “push-outs” who have been victimized and criminalized by schools.</p>\n<p>“They get punished overwhelmingly, they get reported to police, they get told ‘you’re not allowed in school’ because they’re truant,” Rios said. “They end up in the streets and become vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>Rios said many struggling high school students receive mostly informational support from teachers and emotional support is largely overlooked.</p>\n<p>“We just see you as a student, an empty container to be filled with knowledge, that doesn’t have anything to offer me as an educator except to sit there and take notes,” Rios said. “Right now, a lot of emotional connection is lost in the educational system.”</p>\n<p>Rios also said he wants to advocate for educational curriculum based on restorative justice rather than punishment.</p>\n<p>“The best way to teach kids a lesson when they mess up is to give them love, connection, emotional support and, of course, holding them accountable,” Rios said. “We need more restorative justice.”</p>\n<p>Last April, Rios spoke at T.E.D.xUCSB, a locally organized T.E.D. event featuring UCSB professors from various departments. In his talk, Rios said the generation currently in higher education is sometimes considered the “dumbest” and most “narcissistic,” but he does not believe this to be true.</p>\n<p>“We got it all wrong — politicians, education systems, the media,” Rios said. “In national surveys and local studies, we’re finding that your generation craves emotional connection — that your generation actually empathizes in a larger, deeper way than former generations.”</p>\n<p>Also at the T.E.D.x event, Rios said educators need to employ a more emotional method when teaching the millennial generation, as it is more focused on personal connection and social impact than generations before.</p>\n<p>“When we teach to the heart, the mind follows,” Rios said. “When we connect with [students] in an emotional way, in a compassionate way, it opens up avenues for them to learn in an academic setting.”</p>\n<p>According to Rios, presenting in New York will be an important opportunity to convey his message about education reform.</p>\n<p>“I have the potential to leave a message to the world about how we could help kids that are on the street corners lost, kids that are abused, kids that society has forgotten about, kids that have been called criminals and thugs,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Second-year undeclared major Navid de Leede said Rios’s sociology class encouraged him to take action to improve the educational achievement gap at his old high school.</p>\n<p>“We went to Professor Rios’s office hours and asked him, because what are you gonna do with a problem that’s been ingrained for years in our specific hometown?” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>Second-year pre-biology student Anthony Lavezzo said Rios helped jump-start the educational program with de Leede at his high school.</p>\n<p>“He was more like guiding us rather than pushing his own philosophy. He gave us recognition after we developed our project,” Lavezzo said.</p>\n<p>According to de Leede, Rios spoke extensively about educational inequality against under-privileged students during his lectures.</p>\n<p>“We learned that he was very passionate about not leaving students behind because of their financial situation or their socioeconomic background,” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65681\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65681\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/","id":2675,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2674,2673,2672],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic building for community members to discuss benefits and disadvantages of various self-governance options for I.V.</p>\n<p>Students, I.V. residents, government representatives and other stakeholders weighed the options of cityhood, a Community Service District (CSD) and a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and Area Planning Commission (APC), taking the recently released Isla Vista Governance Options Financial Analysis Study into consideration. The majority of the discussion centered on the possibility of creating both a CSD, through Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), and a MAC.</p>\n<p>AB 3 will become law Jan. 1, allowing for the creation of a CSD in I.V. if it is approved by potential residents in the November 2016 election. If approved, the CSD will be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which will tax residents five to eight percent of their utility bills.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, cityhood requires “high taxation,” while a CSD would impose a more reasonable rate.</p>\n<p>“In order to meet the levels that we would need to fund the city, we would have to run the highest UUT and also find some other taxes,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>While the CSD formation requires approval from only 50 percent of voters, the UUT requires a two thirds vote. I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and long-time I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said she is concerned I.V. could potentially have an unfunded CSD.</p>\n<p>“We may end up with a CSD and a board but no funding mechanism,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Asian American studies and political science double-major Akshaya Natarajan said a CSD could create jobs for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“Potentially, a funded CSD could also fund student work,” Natarajan said. “There are people looking for part-time jobs that could also benefit.”</p>\n<p>MAC formation will require approval from the County Board of Supervisors, so many attendees of the meeting suggested I.V. attempt to create a MAC before November 2016 to begin the self-governance process before Third District County Supervisor and I.V. advocate Doreen Farr’s term ends in December.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Associated Students Lobby Corps director and fourth-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez, a MAC and CSD could function together to govern I.V.</p>\n<p>“If you have an AB 3-style CSD we would be allowed to have a MAC within that,” Lopez said. “They’re not mutually exclusive choices.”</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Downtown Business Association Vice President Jay Freeman, a MAC would hold general purpose meetings and advise the county on various I.V. issues, at less cost than a city or CSD.</p>\n<p>“We get almost all of the benefit for almost none of the cost by going with the Municipal Advisory Council or Advisory Planning Commission,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while a CSD is more expensive, the benefits of hiring staff to manage I.V. are important.</p>\n<p>“When you say administration is a cost, it’s not really a cost, it’s a positive,” Abboud said. “A person is very valuable. They can help organize people and they can provide information. Right now we don’t have that one person that Isla Vista pays to take care of I.V.”</p>\n<p>Meeting attendees also discussed UCSB’s involvement in I.V. governance. Assistant Vice Chancellor for Alumni Affairs George Thurlow said by buying properties such as Tropicana Student Housing, the university helps provide affordable housing for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We don’t need to make a profit on it,” Thurlow said. “The hopeful part is that we can create a market situation where it is harder for other landlords to gouge students.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story

emotional issue. <em>Andrew Gates/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Students for Life of America hosted an event titled the “The Abortion Debate” between pro-choice UCSB professor of philosophy Quentin Gee and pro-life author Trent Horn to discuss abortion and women’s reproductive rights in the United States.</p>\n<p>Horn is the author of pro-life book Persuasive Pro-Life: How to Talk About Our Culture’s Toughest Issue, which claims to equip readers with the knowledge to be “a bold and effective apologist for the unborn.” Gee’s current research focuses on collective responsibility and the topic’s relation to ethical, political and legal philosophy. The debate format followed a 15-minute opening speech, 10-minute rebuttal and an eight-minute cross examination for each participant and ended with an audience Q&amp;A session. Ph.D. candidate in philosophy Keith Hess moderated the debate.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Opening the evening’s discussion, Gee said debates at universities cannot be based on religious dogma and should instead pursue a “practically available, publically moral status” for the issue. Gee then posed a hypothetical “thought experiment” about the ethicality of aborting fetuses.</p>\n<p>“If you were in a fertility clinic which was about to burn down, and you could save one infant in basket or save 10,000 embryos in cold storage, I doubt anyone would vote to save the embryos.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, the “cutoff line” for permissible abortion can operate at 23 weeks gestational age. Gee said although it is a contentious issue, the fetus cannot commonly feel pain at this stage.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it is necessarily wrong afterwards, but as a precaution to avoid a potential problem,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>Gee said those who factor religious reasoning into the abortion debate lack knowledge of embryotic life.</p>\n<p>“If you do in fact think the embryo has same status as baby, approximately 50 percent of embryos fail to lead to full pregnancy because of an inability to implant to the uterine wall,” Gee said. “By this logic, if you don’t think God is the number one baby death enabler, death is not indicative of the status of a fetus.”</p>\n<p>Gee said the core of his argument is that a fetus’s conceivable rights do not hold precedence to a woman’s rights in controlling her body.</p>\n<p>“A fetus and newborn baby, even if they have interests, doesn’t mean they trump all other interests,” Gee said. “I think it is possible for a woman to say ‘I cannot take care of this baby’ … it wouldn’t be looked upon well … but I think this is permissible.”</p>\n<p>In his introductory statement, Horn said it is generally wrong to directly kill innocent human beings, that fetuses are innocent human beings and that it is therefore wrong to kill fetuses.</p>\n<p>Horn then showed a series of photographs of fetuses at various stages of development from eight weeks to 22 weeks. According to Horn, abortion is the killing of a human being.</p>\n<p>“Abortion is not a passive removal of life, it is the act of killing a child via dismemberment,” Horn said. “It’s like giving someone a kidney and then ripping it out, killing him or her in a violent process.”</p>\n<p>Horn said because a fetus is a human with potential for growth, it follows that the fetus has the basic right to not be killed.</p>\n<p>“Saying an unborn is inhuman because it is just a fetus is like saying a 15-year-old is not a human because they are just a teenager,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>According to Horn, subjecting fetuses to a non-human status based on their inability to feel pain is an act of “ableism,” a form of discrimination based on stigmatizing disability. Horn also said Gee’s “thought experiment” is unfounded because logical decisions cannot be based on intuition.</p>\n<p>“My position is unborn [fetuses] are human organisms; all humans should have basic human rights regardless of their functional ability,” Horn said, “Just because we have different intuitions at different times doesn’t mean we should rely on our feelings. Instead, let’s look toward rational arguments.”</p>\n<p>The cross examination portion of the debate contrasted Horn’s requirement for a definition of personhood with Gee’s assertion that intuition plays a role in deciding the moral worth of a human in any stage.</p>\n<p>Gee said rather than a definition of personhood, the moral state of a fetus involves a “cluster of requirements.”</p>\n<p>“There is some sort of mental concept, no possibility for a rich mental life. It involves a conscious interest and desire to keep living,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>In response, Horn said a fetus does not need to consciously demonstrate its desire for life in order to be considered viable for the right of life.</p>\n<p>“I think you can have an interest in living without consciously alluding to it, because the zygote — there is some element of an interest in its living in terms of growth,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Horn and Gee began the Q&amp;A portion of the event by responding to the question of what would motivate the two participants to change their stance on the topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>Horn said he would require an argument separating the worth of humans with those of children.</p>\n<p>“I could be moved to change my mind if it could be shown that all human beings don’t have equal rights … that they don’t really have a right to live in the organ designed for them,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Gee said he would change his position if a fetus was shown to have certain mental capabilities.</p>\n<p>“I would require something on the order of showing that the organism in question has a deep, fairly rich mental life,” Gee said. “I think if you could show that, we could be concerned with killing the life.”</p>\n<p>In a closing statement, Gee said he would like to reassert his claim that a fetus’s rights should not be considered with more weight than a woman’s “deeply personal” autonomy over her own body.</p>\n<p>“While there is some value for whichever stage the zygote or fetus is in, I don’t think it is a value that trumps a woman’s right to bodily integrity,” Gee said. “If there was a body that had the same moral status as you and me, then there would be more value.”</p>\n<p>In Horn’s closing statement, he said humans should be defined and valued by their membership in a social community rather than their functional capabilities.</p>\n<p>“Human beings should be valued not for their functions, but because they belong to this community. I think an important question tonight is ‘Who are we allowed to kill?’” Horn said. “We should have a pit in our stomach regardless of whether it is a child or a fetus, because in the end, they all have the same intrinsic potential.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Delaney Forester said she wanted to further understand Horn’s position.</p>\n<p>“Horn made a comment earlier about a biological parent’s inherent responsibility to take care of a child unless they are deemed unfit,” Forester said. “My question is, what is the deciding factor in what makes you unfit?”</p>\n<p>Hess said the audience contributed to a civil and constructive debate, allowing both speakers to properly assert their views.</p>\n<p>“I liked how the students kept it civil. There wasn’t any … hot-heads or name-calling so I think this is the way that debates should be done,” Hess said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Students for Life of America President and fourth-year economics major Katie Devlin said the event was successful in fostering a productive discussion on the controversial topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>“I thought both speakers did a wonderful job. The audience also had really good questions,” Devlin said. “It was great how we could have a civil conversation about this sometimes controversial topic.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on

of the campaign is to increase the size and diversity of the C.A.P.S. staff.</p>\n<p>“I think that we should prioritise diversity in hiring more therapists … so that students don’t have to wait longer to see a therapist after they’ve seen a therapist for the first time,” Zohoori said.</p>\n<p>Zohoori said there are concerns about increasing outreach, because C.A.P.S. already has limited resources.</p>\n<p>“We also really want to work on outreach, but it’s a big catch-22 because the more outreach we do, the less we’ll be able to support our students with the care that they deserve,”

the Beauty, Brains and Everything in Between forum as a part of Hermanas Unidas’ Raza (Race) week Tuesday in North Hall.</p>\n<p>At the forum, members of the three organizations discussed the challenges women of color face on a university campus. Raza Week will also include events such as a potluck, movie night and a Salsa night with organizations such as the Pan-African Student Union, El Congresso and La Familia de Colores.</p>\n<p>Hermanas Unidas representative and third-year feminist studies and sociology double-major Regina Ramirez said Hermanas Unidas hosted Raza Week to provide organizations with an opportunity to network.</p>\n<p>“We can be such a big support system for one another, mostly being women, and mostly being underrepresented,” Ramirez said.</p>\n<p>Ramirez said she was “really excited” about co-hosting Beauty, Brains and Everything in Between because it brought diverse women together to share their experiences.</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Beauty, Brains and Everything in Between is “empowering” and motivating for students who may struggle at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of struggles that we as women of color go through, not just with academics, but also how we see ourselves within campus,” Ramirez said. “It’s really helpful because we’re sharing our experiences.”</p>\n<p>Sigma Theta Psi Multicultural Chair, Co-host of the event and third-year feminist studies and sociology double-major Carina Garibay said she feels categorized by her ethnicity instead of individual qualities. According to Garibay, university environments would benefit from professors and other faculty properly considering the needs of women of color.</p>\n<p>“Professors have such an influence on how we feel on campus as well, as women and as women of color,” Garibay said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Patsy Solano said women of color often feel out of place as science, technology, math and engineering majors.</p>\n<p>“We’re looked down upon and not given much hope,” Solano said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and sociology double-major Casandra Phillips said institutional changes should include “seeing more women and women of color at a higher level” to promote students utilizing their resources.</p>\n<p>According to Phillips, women of color should not “victimize themselves.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, we are women of color, but we’re just people like everyone else,” Phillips said. “I don’t have to prove anything to anyone but myself, I’m here for myself.”</p>\n<p>Third-year linguistics and sociology double-major Nora Rosales said the event opened doors for women to start new conversations.</p>\n<p>“If there isn’t any representation of people that look like us, or people who think like us, or been through the things we’ve been through, then how the hell are they supposed to help us?” Rosales said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Regina Ramirez is a part of Sigma Theta Psi, however she is a representative of Hermanas Unidas and not a member of the sorority.
