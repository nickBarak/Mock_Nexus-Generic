id=\"caption-attachment-71212\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mural at North Hall that honors the students who protested there for Black rights in 1968. </span><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers, including UCSB students and community organizers, gave speeches on their personal experiences with racism, institutionalized oppression in higher education and the importance of allyship. The procession of approximately 100 then walked to North Hall, stopping at the mural that honors the students who protested there for Black rights in 1968, before ending at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) for lunch.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was hosted by the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee of Santa Barbara, UCSB’s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the MCC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chris Hudley, vice president of the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee, elaborated on the importance of the theme “Remembering The Silence of Our Friends,” which comes from the famous King quote: “We remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During political years, we have forgotten to have conversations,” Hudley explained. “We want the idea of people having conversations, learning and collaborating, to build inclusiveness and equality.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inclusion of friends in conversation was emphasized throughout the event; participants were asked to talk to strangers during the walk about the change they wish to see in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Frick-Jenkins, president of UCSB’s Black Student Union, discussed the Eternal Flame monument, where the walk begins. The Flame was donated as a gift by the UCSB Class of 1968 to commemorate peace and unity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the Eternal Flame … commemorates the ongoing legacy of MLK because he lit a similar flame under Black students to take under North Hall and demand equality. I find it important for Black students and those who understand their struggle to not only see the monument as one to MLK’s legacy but also one about taking up space in this institution,” Frick-Jenkins said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frick-Jenkins’ ideas of “self determination, Black freedom and liberation,” which were recurring themes throughout the event, led to a discussion of empowerment in institutions of higher education like UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take up space here,” Frick-Jenkins told attendees. “We can see ourselves within this institution that was not inherently made for the education of Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deandre Miles-Hercules, president of the Black Graduate Students Association, touched on their personal experiences as a Black, gender nonconforming individual and, similarly to Frick-Jenkins, their struggle with taking up space in academia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is important for me personally, because I am Black and gender nonconforming and as a scholar that is not often a comfortable place to be, and in the world that it is often dangerous and harmful to be in,” Miles-Hercules said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MLK said direct action is presenting our very bodies to the conscience of the public of our national and local communities,” they explained. “My presence and showing up authentically is direct action. That too is walking in Dr. King’s legacy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While talking to the crowd, Miles-Hercules also emphasized how their presence at UCSB is statistically unlikely. In the 2017-18 academic year, only 3% of graduate students were Black, whereas 5.8% of California residents were Black, a nearly 3% difference between state and university demographics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Regent Elect and UCSB graduate student Jamaal Muwwakkil, another speaker, reiterated this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not supposed to be here. I’m a poor kid from Compton, California. The statistics are against me … I was not supposed to gain access to the UC. The paradigm for Black students is that diversity lowers standards, that the more Black students you have, the lower the ranking of your school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anne H. Charity-Hudley, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Hall Endowed Chair in the Linguistics of African America</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and linguistics professor, encouraged attendees to discuss with others what made them come out to the event on their walk to North Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miriam Bankons, a participant who has been coming to the event for five years, was eager to share her answer to Charity-Hudley’s question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m here in memory of all the people that came before me and walking for them,” she said. “Talking to other people that we don’t know, that we don’t see, is a way to honor King. His holiday is about a day of service, and I believe this is a way of service.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the march reached North Hall, Charity-Hudley recounted the racism she has experienced while achieving success in academia, including being targeted by police and having drawings of lynchings painted on her wall after receiving a raise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In many positions, people are happy to see Black people on campus until they receive raises, labs and support. There’s a level of tension when we don’t stay in our place … I want you to think about how we can continue to rise until you make somebody else nervous with your level of success.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants then walked to the MCC to enjoy lunch, celebrate successes made in the name of Black empowerment and listen to MLK’s most famous speeches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many attendees discussed how Miles-Hercules’s words resonated with them, especially their ending comments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Be a brother, a sister, be a partner in crime to equity and justice, and show up when things are hard and let go of some of that privilege that you might bear in the service of equity and justice,” Miles-Hercules said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is how we walk in Dr. King’s footsteps and honor his memory.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

legislature in June. </span><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2020-21/pdf/BudgetSummary/HigherEducation.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which allocates $36 billion for higher education across the state, offers a 5% increase in “base” resources for UC campuses, as well as funding for several specific programs on UC campuses, including the expansion of the UC Riverside School of Medicine, UC San Francisco School of Medicine and the UC San Diego Center for Public Preparedness Multi-Campus Research Initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important step toward covering the funds necessary to meet UC’s tripartite mission of delivering world-class education, conducting cutting-edge research and providing public service that benefits California and beyond,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Board of Regents Chair John Pérez and UC President Janet Napolitano said in a joint statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to ongoing funding, the budget aims to help students who require immigration legal services to defend themselves in court, support degree and certificate completion programs at UC extension centers and develop a UC Subject Matter Project in computer science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement by UC Student Association (UCSA) President Varsha Sarveshwar, who “welcomed” the proposed budget, she expressed hope that UCSA could work with legislators “to secure additional investments that reflect UC student priorities: investments in outreach and retention programs, mental health services, and resources for undocumented students, foster youth, and formerly incarcerated students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the budget proposal stated that “these investments are provided with the expectation that UC will continue to focus on maintaining college affordability, increasing student access, improving timely degree completion, and reducing achievement gaps,” it made no explicit mention of the services Sarveshwar detailed in her statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget also detailed expectations for the UC System, but it held no requirements to maintain current tuition rates. The UC has proposed a tuition increase over five years to fund financial aid and other campus needs, with the UC Regents voting on the increase Jan. 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarveshwar stated that “UCSA also hopes to work with the Governor’s office and members of the legislature to secure the funding necessary to avoid a tuition increase.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s proposed budget took into account the “significant growth” of the UCs in the past few years, and this year’s budget increase seems intended to do the same, as the proposal states that its 10 campuses now enroll more than 280,000 students, as opposed to far smaller numbers merely a decade ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newsom’s budget will not go into effect until it is voted on by the state legislature in June. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Strikers at UCSC have been calling for a cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) of $1,412 a month, according </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payusmoreucsc.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the website for the UCSC strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As early as September 2019, organizers as part of the GSA, UAW2865, and from across campus have been calling for a Cost of Living Adjustment. The demand has been repeatedly presented to UCSC administration without equivocations,” the campaign wrote on its website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COLA of $1,412 a month was calculated to bring “every graduate student, regardless of residence, visa, documentation, employment or funding status…. Out of rent burden; and To parity with grad students at UC Riverside,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students have refused to upload grades to Canvas — a learning management website similar to Gauchospace — since Dec. 9, 2019, the first official day of their strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB Graduate Student Association passed </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iEd_O-dZ_KCut7HQHeEHoxHLlOwbCxkyZngRN1VaD5Y/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a resolution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of the UCSC strike at its  general meeting on Jan. 14, stating “unequivocally [their] full support for [their] fellow graduate students at UC Santa Cruz in their demand for a cost of living adjustment (COLA), including their engagement in a Wildcat Strike.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC strike is a “wildcat” strike, meaning that it does not have union approval.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The vast majority of graduate students spend more than half of their paychecks on housing, with many going to extreme lengths to make ends meet,” the resolution continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Santa Cruz grads’ decision to withhold grades is a brave and an ingenious use of our power as graduate students. The UC only works because we do, and our compensation should both reflect the value of our labor and account for the high cost of living in California.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB 4 COLA, the advocacy group calling for a COLA for UCSB graduate students, began circulating an FAQ regarding the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-GnQx0HSjGBotw6WJoBn34oxs3gYuXVbwbtCo3MdPUo/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sick-out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ckhIm4A2rCsKdbzlDcP6WyQ_aHPZkGhdFj58NN2Ti8/edit?fbclid=IwAR1jGycg1x3IvhGiGUw8wASVrMWTSf3_n5_zfj-fOUxPMaYzFtSTfPO-Vvs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a whole, stressing that Wednesday’s action was not a formal strike but instead the beginning of “a COLA movement of [their] own.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will collectively draft a list of demands to give administration, and if those demands are not met, then we will discuss the possibility of a strike with the graduate student body,” UCSB 4 COLA wrote in the COLA FAQ. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will not pursue a strike unless we decide that it is a necessary action and graduate students support escalation of that sort </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there will be plenty of opportunities to express your opinions on the matter each step of the way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sheila Kulkarni, a Ph.D student at UCSB and an organizer with UCSB 4 COLA, said that UCSB graduate students decided to engage in the sick-out in part due to their own struggles with the cost of living in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On average, UCSB graduate students put 48% of their income toward rent, putting them within just a few percentage points of the 50% threshold considered “severe rent burden” by the Office of Housing and Urban Development, according to a survey taken by the UCSB Graduate Student Association last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea would be a disruption of regular classroom activity,” Kulkarni said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students, on average, would need an additional $1133.57 for their rent to equal 30% of their income, according to an informal UCSB GSA survey, which Kulkarni said measured roughly 500 of the 2,906 graduate students. That survey also measured that UCSB graduate students make on average $2091.98 a month.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahead of the sick-out, UCSB 4 COLA held a meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss logistics regarding Wednesday’s demonstration, such as what route the march would take, what signs to make, what slogans to chant and what committees to create. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Wednesday’s demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kulkarni emphasized that UCSB graduate students must be the ones to decide whether or not to engage in further labor actions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really up to everyone if they want to go on strike, it’s not something the GSA can decide,” Kulkarni said. “It’s something all grad students have to decide.”</span><span style=\"font-weight:

We’re already overstressed unless we’re given the resources for new faculty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christopher Chase-Dunn, a sociology professor at UCR, expressed bewilderment at the campus goal of expanding resources to accommodate 10,000 extra students within the next 15 years. He emphasized the ongoing challenges in addressing the already-expanding undergraduate student body with a limited amount of resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chase-Dunn, many faculty members remain “very concerned” about this issue since there does not seem to be a plan for sustainable growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we just expand and take care of all of the poor kids in California and solve the problem for the rest ofrestall the other campuses, we’re gonna be diplomable, doing online courses and handing out things, but it won’t really be an institution that meets the stands of the University of California system,” he stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The plan is to expand the campus hugely over the next few years, and we’re very concerned because apparently there’s no agreement on how we’re going to have enough resources in order to do that,” Chase-Dunn said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the students and faculty at UCR also condemned the current lack of resources and the fact that classes are held in old buildings with various utility issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Assistant Vice Chancellor and Campus Architect Jaqueline Norman, many of the buildings on campus were built during the early 1900s and during the 1950s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of these buildings have not had any significant renovation or improvements since their original construction,” Norman said. “Supporting contemporary learning and cutting-edge research in aging buildings with often failing infrastructure is a daily institutional challenge.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many also expressed their frustrations regarding a perceived status bias and disparity in funding allocations — </span><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2012/06/10/rebenching_budget_model_to_evenly_allocate_state_funds_per_student_to_each_uc_campus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a 2012 report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, showed an allocation of $398 million at UCLA, versus $154 million given to UCR and $117 million to UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are the lowest core-funded campus in the UC, heavily reliant on state funds, tuition and fees,” Jennifer Brown, a professor of public policy, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we need is a president … who will reverse the structural inequities which have existed across the system. As a woefully underfunded campus, UCR has fewer resources for our current students than other UC campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She pointed to figures obtained from UCR Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox’s office, which showed that UCLA receives $11,444 per student, while UCR receives $8,447 per student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We understand that there are weighted algorithms involved in this, but we still believe that this is an instance of institutional racism,” Brown said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She attributed this to the composition of UCR’s </span><a href=\"https://www.ucr.edu/about/ranks-and-facts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student body</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has a higher proportion of minority students compared to other campuses in the UC system on average. The student body, of which 86.6% identifies as a minority, has a higher overall ethnic diversity than </span><a href=\"http://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"https://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. More Pell Grant students are enrolled at UCR than at all of the Ivy League universities combined, and nearly 60% of the student body is made up of first-generation college attendees, according to data from the official </span><a href=\"https://www.ucr.edu/about/ranks-and-facts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCR website.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Therefore, we ask that the next president commit to funding UCR on a proportional basis equivalent to other campuses and erase the structural inequalities which are deeply eroding the quality of access at UCR,” Brown said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students also associated lack of funding as being especially harmful to minority or underrepresented groups, often drawing from their own personal experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silvia Ferrer, a DACA recipient at the university, spoke about navigating the legal difficulties associated with her immigration status.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferrera cited university support groups as critical in supporting her academic endeavors, but also described these programs as being “substantially underfunded,” which she said came as no surprise in light of the campus’s status as the lowest core-funded campus in the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent Rasso, director of government relations for Associated Students at UCR, said that the next UC president must work to help students facing urgent housing and food insecurities, issues which he attributed to being more pervasive at UCR among Black and Hispanic students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next UC president must be a strong ally to students by working diligently within university and legislative governance to uplift the voices of  students,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public commentary for the next UC president can be submitted to the Regents through email or postal mail, with the addresses on the Search Committee </span><a href=\"https://presidentialsearch.universityofcalifornia.edu/public-input.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec21eb515a0882fb7b969b6d32fa5b66?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec21eb515a0882fb7b969b6d32fa5b66?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/heather-carr/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Heather Carr</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Heather Carr is an Opinion and News staff writer.

Wellness and co-chair of the Mental Health Task Force.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The site features subpages including Urgent Needs and Basic Needs, as well as links to prominent campus wellness organizations such as Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) and Student Health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Urgent Needs section provides quick access to resources such as the UC Police Department, financial emergency assistance and sexual assault advocacy, while the Basic Needs section informs students on resources such as campus food banks, affordable housing and budgeting strategies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also has a brief summary of every listed wellness organization on campus and  the services each organization offers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The website is also a statement to students that we highly value supporting the well-being of our students for their quality of life, but also as integral to their success at UC Santa Barbara and beyond,” O’Brien said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to O’Brien, the Mental Health Task Force collaborated with a variety of campus groups to ensure the website was comprehensive, including the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Student Health Services, Alcohol &amp; Drug Programs, C.A.P.S., Health &amp; Wellness, C.A.R.E., Student Mental Health Coordination Services, Disabled Students Programs, Career Services, Housing, the Educational Opportunity Program, the Graduate Division and the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Security &amp;

The most recent trip took place over this past winter break and brought students to Texas, according to Alec Valdez, who serves as the alternative breaks co-coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdez, a fourth-year history of public policy major, said alternative breaks fit the model of Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) as a whole: serving the local community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At some point [C.A.B.] came up with the idea of doing a program that went … out of the state of California. It’s a great program because it allows you to go outside of your comfort zone, outside of your culture zone,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B.’s free week-long volunteer trips are held during winter and spring break, and the group also holds a weekend trip during spring quarter. According to Valdez, Community Collaborations International (CCI), a private organization dedicated to setting up alternative break programs, helps C.A.B. set up the trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CCI offers different locations and programs, Valdez said, and his job as co-coordinator is to look through the programs and pick which one works best, alongside making efficient use of the funds available — a task that takes all quarter to plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past winter break, the trip’s participants traveled to San Antonio, Texas, to help with the immigrant community there, Valdez said. He explained that this trip wasn’t “the first time we’re doing social justice work as opposed to just disaster relief,” noting that participants traveled to Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The destinations for each trip vary widely, ranging from Florida to Oregon, according to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/past-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B. website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Students applying to be a part of a volunteer trip, however, are kept in the dark regarding the trip’s location — it isn’t until after they have been accepted that participants are told where the trip will be, Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The big thing is that curiosity because when we put out the applications, they don’t know where they’re going yet. We leave that until the very end when we pick our final team,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/cab-alternative-break-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative breaks website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, each program often gets an average of 200 applicants, but only 10 to 12 students are selected to go on the trip. Valdez emphasized the importance of selecting people who are willing and determined to volunteer, given how the trips are made possible by student fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Valdez said that they are currently working on a smaller version of the alternative breaks: alternative weekends that would take students out of Santa Barbara into the wider California community to places such as San Francisco or Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This isn’t just a vacation trip we’re going on. We’re doing service,” Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure that people who are going on this really value the opportunity and are putting in that effort to see that they really do want to be a part of the team and be a part of the project. We do value effort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Valdez, C.A.B.’s work can vary depending on wherever it is needed most. Both Valdez and Cassandra Zhou, a fourth-year psychology and brain sciences major, attended the 2019 spring break trip to Wilmington, North Carolina and helped families rebuild their homes after Hurricane Florence had passed through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working at an animal shelter one day which had been overrun by abandoned and lost animals. They usually serve somewhere around 70 animals or 60 animals in that area. But then after the storm, they had like 150 animals on the property,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Zhou, the service trip allowed her to expand on her own local volunteering and provide support to people outside of her area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get to do a lot of these things where you interact with different communities and you learn how to communicate with them and how to talk to them,” Zhou said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like volunteering gives you more of a purpose. I also typically don’t travel and alternative breaks with an amazing opportunity to travel for free, meet new people and contribute to a community that really needed help.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 9, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

She worked with the Persian Student Group to quickly plan the vigil in only a few days, calling it a “multi-group effort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar holds the loss close to her heart as she personally knew victims in the crash. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to remember every single life that was lost. It wasn’t just the life — that life had a family, that life had a mom, a dad, a sister, professors, friends,” Abrishamcar told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I myself, my family had a close family friend that passed away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar wasn’t alone in mourning the loss of someone she knew personally. Farhad Kaimi, a community member at the event, said he attended the vigil to “pay respect for the people who died.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had a friend who I knew from middle school and high school. We weren’t close friends but he was on that plane,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Aazam Feiz, a lecturer in Persian language and literature, spoke entirely in Farsi at the vigil. Second-year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gevirtz doctoral student Sepi, who declined to disclose her last name, spoke immediately after Feiz, translating Feiz’s words to English for those who didn’t speak Farsi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are here to pay respect to these victims … as many of you may have heard, a lot of these victims were students and professors, just ordinary people who were visiting family and friends in Iran and never made it back home,” Sepi translated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were kids, newlyweds, whole families, even, who perished,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the vigil, Sepi emphasized the importance of creating an event that is accessible to everyone, regardless of language. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last week, there was a lot of heightened tension, there was a lot of political tension and we are gathering today to honor the lives of innocent victims that were basically as a result of those tensions … I wanted to welcome our non-Iranian friends who gathered with us in solidarity of the lives of the victims who were innocent and who died last week,” Sepi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar echoed this message — that lives lost always need to be remembered, above any political or religious differences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially in the climate that we have in Iran right now, it’s very hard to find unity,” Abrishamcar said after the vigil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone has different beliefs and religions and political preferences, but it’s important to have this vigil to remind the people of Iran, in Iran and outside of Iran, that at the end of the day, we are all Iranians and we have to remember these 176 lives that were lost. Their death[s] should not be cluttered with the politics that’s going on right now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the vigil, Feiz recited traditional Persian poetry, a cultural custom often performed during times of mourning, according to Abrishamcar, who said there are specific ways to both sing and pronounce the verses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the group joined together in singing the Iranian national anthem, the vigil ended as it began — in the glow of the candlelight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Iran is a country of many religions and many cultures. We’re not all Persian, we’re not all Muslim. There’s Jewish people, agnostics, atheists, Baháʼís, Zoroastrian people,” Abrishamcar said after the vigil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But Persian culture is so different. Persian culture goes back thousands and thousands of years. And that’s what unites all of us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Persian Student Group plans to host another vigil mourning the victims on Feb. 18.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

This is a $110 million increase compared to last year and specifically increases the UC General Fund by $217 million. The budget also includes $84 billion for K-12 schools and $750 million for a new state fund. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz: Continued Striking at UC Santa Cruz (<em><a href=\"https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/01/10/skilled-craft-workers-launch-indefinite-strike/\">City on a Hill Press</a></em>) </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Wednesday, the UC Santa Cruz American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) K7 workers were on their ninth day of striking; they announced earlier this month that striking would continue until the university presented them a contract that delivers “liveable standards.” K7 includes over 50 employees on the UCSC campus, such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters and HVAC mechanics. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCLA: UCLA Rejects Proposal for Students Experiencing Homelessness (<em><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/15/ucla-rejects-parking-space-proposal-for-students-experiencing-homelessness/\">Daily Bruin</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA rejected a proposal from the North Westwood Neighborhood Council and the Undergraduate Students Association Council, calling it “unsanitary” for students to sleep in their cars on campus. Instead, the administration suggested a “hostel-like” environment where students pay $15 per night. A small-scale version of the hostel program would include 100 beds and could potentially begin as soon as Fall Quarter 2020. The councils also called on UCLA administration to collect more data on students experiencing homelessness. Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck said in the meeting that it is difficult to identify students facing homelessness versus housing insecurity. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine: Irvine’s Housing Crisis (<em><a href=\"https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/01/13/irvines-housing-crisis-how-housing-insecurity-is-affecting-both-students-and-residents-in-irvine/\">New University</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New University looked back on housing trends over 2019, where increasing prices have led to lower home sales and greater housing insecurity for students and low-income people. These trends are coupled with lack of homeless resources, as earlier this year Irvine (along with four other Orange County cities) was sued for mistreatment of homeless people and lack of shelters in the city. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/","id":3581,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3580,3579,3578],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In Photos | UCSB Students Mourn Victims of Iran Plane Crash","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Iran-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Iran-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB students came together on Thursday to mourn the 176 lives lost in the Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 plane crash.

He shared their annual report with me and I was like, ‘Oh my God, I want to do this.’ And that’s been my goal from when I started here,” Olowude said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Olowude said C.A.P.S. has been organizing its data — gathered in Excel sheets —  and consolidating it with other universities in the UC system, such as UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did a lot of work [in the] unification of our data to make sure that what I’m calling something, someone on another campus is also calling it [the same thing],” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patterns revealed in the data collected will allow C.A.P.S. to pinpoint the cause of any dips in the number of visits, Olowude said. The agency saw a 57% rise in the number of clients visiting C.A.P.S. over the last five years,with a small decline in visits from the 2017-18 to 2018-19 school year, something that Olowude was able to attribute to a drop in available staff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had some resignations and we have some folks who are out on leave. If we have less people … we see less people,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When there is fewer staff, the burden and stress then falls on other psychologists at C.A.P.S., who are forced to see more people and cut down individual session times in order to accommodate more students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another problem Olowude identified is the lack of diversity among staff, an issue he said he has been trying to tackle by hiring clinicians that can assist historically underserved populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the report, the biggest populations served at C.A.P.S. are White/Caucasian at 29.9%, Chicano/Mexican American at 25.2%, Chinese/Chinese American at 10.8% and Black/African American/African at 8.6%. In comparison to overall ethnicity statistics in the 2018-19 campus profile, White students make up 38% of the UCSB population, with Latinos/Chicanos at 28%, Asians/Pacific Islanders at 27% and Black/African American students at 5%.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92023\" style=\"width: 795px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92023\" data-attachment-id=\"92023\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/c-a-p-s-first-annual-report-shows-57-increase-in-total-visits-over-five-years/screenshot-25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"785,1007\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screenshot (25)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92023 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=785%2C1007\" alt=\"\" width=\"785\" height=\"1007\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?w=785&amp;ssl=1 785w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=768%2C985&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92023\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of C.A.P.S.</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude noticed that a large proportion of students who see C.A.P.S. come from underserved populations and has since been trying to accommodate students who may face a stigma from their families for seeking out mental health services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some people don’t feel comfortable explaining the therapy that they’re going to get with their families. Well, when they’re here, they don’t have to and it’s confidential,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address these students in particular, C.A.P.S. created the position of assistant director of Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion. The position, held by psychologist Meridith Merchant, is intended to help identify what can be done to make C.A.P.S. a more inclusive environment in order to connect with more populations of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We decided to create a specific leadership position that would interact with various populations, various departments to help us understand how to best serve our students who come from very diverse backgrounds,” Olowude said. “The mental health initiative and inclusion is how can we be a more inclusive agency and what kind of initiatives we need as a department, a division and ultimately a campus to best serve our students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/c-a-p-s-only-black-female-psychologist-reflects-on-what-brought-her-to-ucsb/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579158392170000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNYJwurUbZFIm6L3jAwYQsW-JguA\">recruited to work at UCSB in 2013</a> and cited the Black Student Union’s 2012 demands as a major reason for her decision to work at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Olowude believes the report can help C.A.P.S. predict and prepare accordingly for when counselors might be swamped by work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say, okay, so [these are] the six weeks of the quarter, what should I be expecting? Okay, we know we’re going to get inundated, so we need to make sure that no vacations are approved that week and we have everyone fully staffed and ready to go,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The annual report’s data shows when new staff should begin work in times of high service, along with revealing which student populations require more resources to properly help them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Olowude, the report will be available on the C.A.P.S. website within the next week. It will also be circulated among the student body and UCSB administration, along with organizations such as the Student Mental Health Task Force run by Associated Students President Alison Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very proud of the work that C.A.P.S. is doing.

He said that he attracted users over to the new subreddit by simply telling people on the current page to come transfer over, promising a better moderator presence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning, Boe worked in a team of three, including UCSB alumni u/beetling and u/Rlight. The team has worked hard to make the page “a place for inclusion” — where r/UCSantaBarbara members could come together and help one another, according to Boe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, however, that “place of inclusion” has grown substantially. In the last eight years, the number of submissions to the page has grown by nearly 500%, according to a post detailing the number of annual submissions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the page has become so popular that Boe and his team have found it hard to maintain the vast community on their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been rather amazing watching this subreddit grow from an initial 50 to the now nearly 14,000 subscribers. However, lately, we’ve noticed we spend more of our time moderating than we’d prefer,” Boe detailed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accommodate the page’s growth, Boe posted a callout to the Reddit community in November, encouraging UCSB students to apply to become a new moderator and work alongside the current group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the callout was posted, Boe announced in a later post that month that two new moderators, fourth-year pharmacology major u/thejappster and third-year biological science major u/swimming_legend, had been selected. Both new moderators asked to be referred to only by their usernames, citing privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boe said the two new moderators stood out in the selection process because they were some of the most active people on the page. Their post history met Boe’s and u/beetling’s standards for the position and they both appeared to be students who genuinely cared about the UCSB Reddit community, Boe added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/thejappster said he used the subreddit to help him navigate his time at UCSB — researching classes, asking for advice and staying up to date on news in the community. As a new moderator, he said his focus is on promoting healthy discussion on a wide variety of topics, like local events and what professors or classes to take, and to encourage people with different views to express their opinions, as long as they are not attacking each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can get tricky in stressful situations, such as when the Thomas Fire occurred near campus three years ago. The stress of the situation led to an influx of content and information that was difficult to aggregate, u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, u/thejappster said the subreddit was meaningful to him because of the people who engage with it since they are often students, alumni or people who just live in the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They really care about the subreddit and really care about helping people,” u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/swimming_legend joined the sub his first year at UCSB and said he hasn’t regretted it for a second. He said he uses the page for academic advice, social connections and a good laugh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although u/swimming_legend said he has not been a member of the Reddit page as long as the other moderators, he felt proud to have been “a member of a community that … has a positive impact on its members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said he is excited to implement new ideas for the page and create a more friendly and helpful experience for its users.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new moderator team has already hit the ground running; u/swimming_legend said they are working on a new way to improve the design of the page and make it more user-friendly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One important change that the team is working on, according to u/thejappster, is a way to consolidate all the posts about social groups — such as people who are looking for a group to hang out with in real life. That way people looking to make real friends or who are feeling lonely have a place to meet others in similar situations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the team’s main focus has been around establishing a syllabus bank, which officially launched on Jan. 5, according to an </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/ekf9et/syllabus_bank_new_for_winter_2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announcement on Reddit.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to u/thejappster, the bank is a resource where “users submit syllabi to an online database, like Google Drive and you post that link to the Reddit page.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current and forthcoming improvements to the Reddit page are not only for the benefit of the sub itself but also for the students’ lives, as they use the page as a resource for all things UCSB, Boe stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, having two current students as moderators will also help to better represent the current student perspective at UCSB, Boe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students are the ones who have the opportunity and the time to put into making the community better.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Correction [Jan. 17, 12:38 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Boe was the head moderator of r/UCSantaBarbara, that he maintained the page by himself and that the current team of moderators has three members. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article has been corrected to reflect that r/UCSantaBarbara has no official head moderator, that Boe did not maintain the page by himself and that the current team of moderators has four members. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quotation that contradicted Boe’s statement regarding the moderators’ ideas for the Reddit page has also been removed. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They’ve been cleaning stuff up themselves,” Moomey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey also plans to work with landscaping architect Lynn Kirby on the new Isla Vista Community Center, and he said they are currently deciding on how to landscape the area surrounding the building. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD began using SeeClickFix in April 2019 as part of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pilot program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with United Way. Moomey was one of the original employees and was “critical in getting the project started in Isla Vista,” Allen said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Way originally hired Moomey and one other employee for the program’s launch, but the other person moved to live with family on the East Coast, according to Christina Lydick, former beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista. For a few months, Moomey was the only beautification specialist in the program and responded to most of the service requests, according to Allen. United Way hired two new houseless community members in November 2019, and they started work this January.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the living wage in Santa Barbara County is $16.50 an hour for a working adult with no children, according to the </span><a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06083\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIT Living Wage Calculator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the minimum wage in the county is $12 an hour for businesses with less than 26 employees and $13 an hour for businesses that employ 26 or more employees. Allen said that although the program is intended as a work experience project, the positions still pay above the minimum wage — $15 — due to the high cost of living. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the pilot program began in April 2019, I.V. Beautiful has completed at least 246 service requests, mostly regarding graffiti abatement, according to Allen. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The city of Santa Barbara is finalizing a partnership with United Way to develop a program based on I.V. Beautiful, according to Allen, who added that she aims to begin the program in late February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said that he is a part of the talks between the city of Santa Barbara and United Way and that he may work in the downtown area as part of the program.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been asked to do 20 hours a week in Santa Barbara and continue doing 20 hours a week out here,” Moomey said. “I’m going to love it.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Jan. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/isla-vista-beautification-program-provides-work-for-local-houseless-people-jackson-guilfoil/","id":4288,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[4287,4286,4285],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":16,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
