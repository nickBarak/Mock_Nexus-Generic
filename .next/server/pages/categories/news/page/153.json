While many board members thought the addition would fill a current void in A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions, others felt another branch would add unneeded stress to current student government infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Chloe Stryker, who authored the bill, said the movement was practically retroactive.</p>\n<p>“I think HRC should have been a BCC to begin with,” Stryker said. “An OSL is very specific and this group is very broad. Also, obviously if they were working as an OSL, they wouldn’t have come to us. How does it look if A.S. is turning hundreds of students trying to build a coalition away?”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said the absence of such an organization within the institution reflects poorly on the student body as a whole.</p>\n<p>“It has to do with the way we are represented as a campus to our state, to our nation, to anyone who looks at the UC — they will look at our A.S.,” Mayorga said. “At this point, human rights aren’t even being addressed in our own student government.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis, on the other hand, said the association doesn’t have the funds to support a new board.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important to establish that the vote isn’t upon how necessary human rights are,” Lewis said. “It’s one of the most noble causes you can have in a BCC. But as A.S., we also represent the students and right now we’re in the recessionary period and other BCCs aren’t doing so well.”</p>\n<p>The council ultimately shot down the bill with a 13–9–1 vote.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council decided to take a stance against hate crimes towards the queer community.</p>\n<p>University Owned Off-Campus Housing Representative Alfredo del Cid cited a measure he had written in response to a recent rise in suicide rates amongst queer youth.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the language we use has no intent, but does send bad messages — such as saying, ‘that’s gay,’” del Cid said. “That has recently driven nine young people to death. I’m asking that we pass this, but also take a moment to reflect on what we do and say.”</p>\n<p>Lastly, the board approved a piece of legislation to support today’s Day of Action — a rally in defense of public education.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important for us to show our support for this,” Representative-at-Large Jasmin Esparza said. “We need to stand by our students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26960\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26960\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/","id":3149,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3148,3147,3146],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Who’s Who on Campus","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As UCSB students, it’s easy to identify what makes our peers flock to the university...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As UCSB students, it’s easy to identify what makes our peers flock to the university; the student body is politically savvy and environmentally conscious, its scholars are awarded top honors on a regular basis and off-campus housing is located in an area that can be fittingly described as a beach paradise.</p>\n<p>What’s often overlooked by the student body are the requirements to ensure smooth day-to-day operations at the university. More easily forgotten by the hordes of transient students departing UCSB after a few years are the names, faces and duties of the hundreds of administrators who log their hours on campus for the sake of the university’s academic mission.</p>\n<p>That’s right — considering that most students only spend four years here, five tops — undergraduates are really just little fish in a large sea.</p>\n<p>What follows is a spotlight of the biggest fish on campus.

Yang</p></div></span><strong>Henry T. Yang</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A former dean of engineering and distinguished professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University, Chancellor Henry T. Yang is — quite literally — a rocket scientist.</p>\n<p>Since joining UCSB in 1994 as both chancellor and a professor of mechanical engineering, Yang has seen the university weather a heavy storm. While economic recession has made marks worldwide, its effects have been particularly brutal on state education.</p>\n<p>Despite substantial efforts to combat the devastating budget cuts, Yang said the end of the UC’s fiscal maelstrom is nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p>“Our challenge this year is to sustain the remarkable momentum of our progress while continuing to absorb the state budget cuts,” Yang said in an e-mail. “Despite these budget challenges, we remain absolutely unwavering in our commitment to providing our students with the quality education they deserve. After all, our students are the reason we are here.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, one of his most challenging tasks is communicating effectively with groups such as the UC Office of the President, alumni, donors, community members and representatives in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., to make sure that his decisions are well-informed and well-received.</p>\n<p>“It is important for all voices to be heard so that each person becomes a true partner in the process,” Yang said. “I think that’s what makes UC Santa Barbara so special — we are not just a university, we are also a community.”</p>\n<p>Yang is also well-known for demonstrating his commitment to the heart of the university: its student body. While some high-level administrators struggle to schedule time to spend with their student body, Yang said he thrives on it.</p>\n<p>“My wife, Dilling, and I are privileged to live on campus, near our residence halls and dining commons,” he said. “One of the most enjoyable parts of our daily campus life is getting to know our students — sharing dinner at the dining commons, cheering at student performances and athletic events, talking with students during our regular walks around campus and Isla Vista and working with our students on campus issues.”</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26804\" style=\"width: 191px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"903102166\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26804\" data-attachment-id=\"26804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/gene-lucas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"gene lucas\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Glenn (Gene) Lucas&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"gene lucas\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26804\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-26804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Glenn (Gene) Lucas</p></div></span><strong>Glenn (“Gene”) Lucas</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Executive Vice Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A UCSB alumnus himself, Gene Lucas went on to earn a Sc.D. degree at MIT before returning to UCSB in 1978 to teach at the College of Engineering. In addition to acting as Executive Vice Chancellor, Lucas has also worked as a professor of mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and materials.</p>\n<p>As EVC, Lucas is UCSB’s chief academic officer. His responsibilities — in consultation with the Santa Barbara Division of the Academic Senate — include overseeing academic planning and programming, developing and implementing academic policy as well as monitoring the academic personnel process. The Office of the EVC oversees all academic entities, including on and off-campus instructional units and instructional support programs.</p>\n<p>Lucas said he hopes to keep the university stable on its current track toward academic success and campus growth.</p>\n<p>“I want to see [UCSB] continue to grow in distinction and diversity,” Lucas said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>While planning the university’s future remains a bright spot on his to-do list, Lucas said his job also requires him to handle some somber aspects of public education.</p>\n<p>“Cutting budgets, laying people off, freezing hiring have all been difficult,” Lucas said. “Laying people off is the hardest because of the hardship this places on people that have been loyal contributors to UC Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2083610250\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/marc_fisher_08_30_07/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"marc_fisher_08_30_07\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Marc Fisher&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"marc_fisher_08_30_07\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-26801\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></span><strong>Marc Fisher</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Senior Associate Vice Chancellor, Administrative Services &amp; Campus Architect</strong></p>\n<p>Today, UCSB is globally acclaimed as one of the most beautiful settings to attend college, but the campus actually used to be a ramshackle collection of WWII-era military installments when it was started. In between then and now, the credit for the striking physical appearance of today’s university goes to the likes of Marc Fisher and his predecessors.</p>\n<p>Fisher oversees Design and Construction Services, Campus Planning and Design, Housing and Residential Services and Physical Facilities, just to name a few. As a licensed architect with a Master’s degree in the field, Fisher is the man with the plan — actually, quite a few of them. Over the last eight years, he and his colleagues have developed the 2010 Long Range Development Plan, Campus Plan, Campus Housing Study, Campus Sustainability Plan and Physical Design Framework.</p>\n<p>Fisher said he looks forward to seeing the extensive work turn into tangible — not to mention environmentally-friendly — results.</p>\n<p>“This is an exciting time for our campus,” Fisher said in an e-mail. “It will be a campus that takes full advantage of our physical setting, is rich in texture and yet orderly in form, with many new housing options for our students, faculty and staff. It will be a campus that relies more heavily upon bicycle and pedestrian circulation and will continue to push into new areas of sustainability.”</p>\n<p>In addition to allowing him to utilize his passion for architecture, Fisher said his role at the university has given him the opportunity to join a tight-knit community.</p>\n<p>“My job entails so much variety — it is truly never dull,” he said. “I get to work with great people and have direct access to a cross section of our campus community — students, faculty and staff — as well as our local community.  Along with all of that, we are building and serving a campus environment commensurate with the academic excellence of this university.”</p>\n<p><span></span><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1634231109\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26800\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/young/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"young\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Michael Young&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"young\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-26800\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><strong>Michael Young</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs</strong></p>\n<p>As UCSB students, we know that a university is defined by more than what goes on inside its classrooms. It would be safe to say that Michael Young is responsible for almost everything else.</p>\n<p>As the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Young oversees more than 20 departments, including admissions, counseling, Student Health and the MultiCultural Center. After 20 years on the job, Young said his favorite part has always been — and will continue to be — his connection with the student body.</p>\n<p>“I know this will sound corny, but I really love working with UCSB students,” Young said. “I feel that I lucked out and ended up in a great career, in a great place for students. I’ve also had some extraordinary colleagues here in Santa Barbara and it’s been an absolute joy working with these professionals, trying to do our best to serve students here.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, the opportunity to develop a strong relationship with the student body is a double-edged sword.</p>\n<p>“At times in my job, I have a responsibility for either life-or-death matters relative to students or I have to become involved in situations where the academic careers of certain students are at risk,” Young said. “I’ve found that, even after all these years — and I’m glad of this — it has not come easy. It’s pretty sobering. Every time I am engaged in one of those situations, I am reminded that each and every student is an individual with a life and with a family, with dreams and hopes.”</p>\n<p>Although the Division of Student Affairs has been suffering at least $1 million of cutbacks a year for the past seven consecutive years, Young said he is determined to shield students from the repercussions.</p>\n<p>“[My goal] is to find out the impacts and the implications of the budget situation and then respond to that so that we can find ways to live within our new financial realities and continue to provide high-quality services to students,” Young said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/","id":3498,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3497,3496,3495],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yes Men to Visit UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":" Writer and Managing Editor Lexi Pandell interviews political satire group \"Yes Men\" on their recent activities and future plans.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Daily Nexus: First of all, thank you for taking the time to speak with me.</p>\n<p>No problem.

They’ve stopped a lot of that now after it came out, but there were obvious reasons for targeting them.</p>\n<p>Increasingly over the years, we’ve worked with organizations who have been working on an issue for a long time and they say, “Hey, can you help us by targeting, for example, Dow Chemical because they haven’t cleaned up the mess in Bhopal and we don’t want it to become a precedent that, since they bought Union Carbide and then tried to wash their hands of it.”</p>\n<p>DN: Do you consider what you do to be “high-profile pranks” or is there another term that you prefer?</p>\n<p>We usually call them “actions.” They’re always intended to have political impact. We say “actions” because they’re events or spectacles. … The problem with “pranks” is that it often makes one think that they’re basically meant to be silly. … The other thing about pranks is that they’re often targeted at friends. When somebody describes a prank, they’re often thinking about Ashton Kutcher’s “Punk’d” or friends playing tricks on each other or the practical joke. So, we do, when we can, stay away from the word for that reason. We do think of what we do as having serious intent regardless of how funny or strange it is.</p>\n<p>DN: In your opinion, what are some of the most notable actions that the Yes Men have taken to date?</p>\n<p>Let’s see, probably one of the best publicized was when we printed an entire fake edition of the New York Times and we distributed 100,000 copies on the streets of New York along with volunteers from our mailing list. It was a New York Times that was full of good news, basically a lot of hopeful news. It came out about a week after Obama was elected and the message of it all was to keep pushing people to keep pushing after the election, not to just stop. Which, unfortunately, is in some ways what’s come to pass.</p>\n<p>So, that was pretty notable. But, last year, we impersonated the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is the largest lobbying organization in the world, and we announced that they were changing their position on climate change. And that resulted in not only a huge amount of media attention, but a lawsuit. We’re currently facing that suit and we think that that was widely successful. Not only because we’re being sued, but because them suing us indicates that maybe we’re attacking them where it counts.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”Photo Courtesy of www.yesmenfixtheworld.com” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1923122465\" data-slb-group=\"26698\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26701\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/5_bbc_dow_announcement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg?fit=1132%2C755&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1132,755\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"5_BBC_DOW_Announcement\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"\" title=\"5_BBC_DOW_Announcement\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26701\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>DN: Can you tell me more about the lawsuit that the Chamber of Commerce has pressed and if there are any updates on that situation?</p>\n<p>They are still suing us. There’s not really much going on with it. Right now, there’s been a motion to dismiss by our lawyers…and the judge is reviewing it, and has been for many months. We don’t know exactly when we’ll hear the next thing, but that’s where we’re at right now. Of course, if the judge doesn’t dismiss it and the Chamber continues to press it, then eventually we could end up in court.</p>\n<p>I think that, overall though, the Chamber’s claims are totally ludicrous. I think if we end up in court, they’ll have a lot more to answer for then we do. Because they spend almost half a million dollars every day lobbying, not to mention what they do during elections. Now that there’s no limits on what third parties can spend, the Chambers running tons of advertising for candidates who are super duper business friendly and are basically all Republican candidates.</p>\n<p>DN: So, essentially, are they accusing the Yes Men as a whole of committing fraudulent activities?</p>\n<p>…If you look at the lawsuit, which you can on the [Electronic Frontier Foundation] Web site [www.eff.org], what they’re actually claiming is that we were doing things, basically, as a form of advertising and that we’re trying to make money off of their trademark. I think it’s a really funny assumption that we were in a press conference where we impersonated them, we made direct political statements and then, afterward, our follow-up press releases were all about the content and the issues. It’s hard to understand how they think that we can make a business out of that or make money out of that somehow. It’s a misunderstanding that makes sense for people who only think of business. All they think is that the only reason for existence is making money.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”Photo Courtesy of www.theyesmenfixtheworld.com” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1331337717\" data-slb-group=\"26698\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26700\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/1_dead_man_float/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"1_Dead_Man_Float\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"1_Dead_Man_Float\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26700\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>DN: Now that you’ve achieved a certain level of fame both from the films and the Chamber lawsuit, do you think you and Andy will start to encounter any issues trying to pose as top officials or spokesmen?</p>\n<p>We don’t really know.

There’s a series of workshops that we offer for organizations that have an idea for a project and those that simply want to brainstorm a project and learn all of our tricks. So, that’s kind of where we are right now, but the idea is to kind of spread the joy and make it possible for all kinds of groups to leverage some of the techniques we’ve developed over the years for their own purposes.</p>\n<p>DN: In conclusion, tell me about what you have planned for the Oct. 15 event at UCSB?</p>\n<p>Yeah, well, I mean our plans are to come and talk to people about what we do, what we’ve been doing. We’ll show a show and tell. We’ll show some of the things we have and maybe we’ll lead the audience in a little brain storming session. That’s it, we don’t have any special tricks up our sleeve for Santa Barbara, but we may if it seems like it’s what the audience wants. We will be showing video clips that nobody’s seen before, at least no human[s] other than the Yes Men.</p>\n<p>We’ll be there to answer questions or, if you prefer, we can give you rotten fruit and vegetables to throw at us.

Despite having allotted Transportation &amp; Parking Services a $3.33 lock-in fee at the end of last year, the department has recently increased the price of permits.</p>\n<p>In addition to the paying the quarterly lock-in, A.S. Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said students are now expected to contribute an additional $17.50 per quarter to guarantee free night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>“We have to decide where we want to move forward with it,” Elwood said.</p>\n<p>Following a drawn-out discussion, the board decided to form an ad hoc committee to further investigate the matter.</p>\n<p>“What kind of message does this send to parking services if we give in to their demands?” Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said. “Certain questions need to be answered by PTS before we move forward with this discussion.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the board passed a resolution supporting the federal Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, which seeks to provide immigrants greater access to higher education.</p>\n<p>Alfredo del Cid, university owned off-campus housing representative, said it was A.S.’s duty to speak on behalf of those students who pay student fees, but are denied access to financial aid and other services — a problem which the federal bill will address.</p>\n<p>“These undocumented students are part of our university and the people we represent,” del Cid said. “We’re losing them every day because they just can’t afford to keep paying into the system.”</p>\n<p>Board members were unsure about how their resolution would support the legislation, but the council eventually approved the action.</p>\n<p>Nayra Pacheco, a third-year environmental studies and history of public policy major, said the bill’s main purpose is to establish solidarity between students of all backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“Basically, it allows us to say our student government is behind us and supports the D.R.E.A.M. Act,” Pacheco said. “It helps a lot to have your backing, especially if we need posters or other campaign materials.

Officers sprang into action, but the deft boarder evaded capture by weaving in and out of pedestrian traffic. Assuming he was a free man, the 22-year-old out-of-towner stopped on the side of the street close to the 6600 block in order to put his bottle in his backpack, where deputies caught up with him.</p>\n<p>Inside the busted suspect’s backpack, cops found the opened booze in addition to a prescription bottle with one muscle relaxant pill inside. The prescription was written for a different drug and, to make matters worse, was in a woman’s name.</p>\n<p>The belligerent boarder was subsequently placed under arrest, and immediately started shouting that the officers were going to steal his electronics. In a valiant attempt to protect his property, the man lay on the ground and refused to get up.

In addition to the 35 residential burglaries in the month of July, the IVFP also received 28 reports of miscellaneous burglary and two reports of auto burglary, Vuillemainroy said.</p>\n<p>“The biggest crimes we have been seeing this summer are burglaries,” Vuillemainroy said. “A lot of this happens while kids are out partying and having fun, forgetting to lock their doors and take their keys. … Students need to make sure that they have the keys to their residences every time they leave in order to prevent crime.”</p>\n<p>One of the first burglaries of the month took place on July 3, when a victim awoke to the sound of footsteps in his apartment on the 800 block of Embarcadero del Norte.

Do you have alcohol in your residence? Do you listen to music?</p>\n<p>If you said yes to any of these questions, you should be concerned with the current Social Host Ordinance that is being put before the County of Santa Barbara’s Board of Supervisors.  An “unruly gathering” consists of 5 or more people according to this ordinance. On top of this, if you can be shown to have ‘reason to know’ of a minor consuming alcohol at this so called “gathering”, you can be cited and fined up to $2000.</p>\n<p>What’s worse, we as students came together last year and showed the Board of Supervisors that the draft of the Social Host Ordinance they had proposed would be disproportionately disadvantageous to the tenants of Isla  Vista. We organized, mobilized, and educated people on the facts as to why this ordinance would create untold consequences for Isla Vista’s population.</p>\n<p>However, the draft that is coming before the Board of Supervisors on June 1<sup>st</sup>, this Tuesday, has addressed a few of the student concerns but still completely fails to meet the standard students want from a law they will have to live under.  The draft scoffs at the work that peer educators at Student Health have made trying to make positive change.  A group of student leaders tried to work with the people crafting this new draft to make it more amicable to the housing situation in Isla Vista.  They claimed that our insights were little more than hyperbolic hypotheses of how this ordinance can be applied and disregarded them.</p>\n<p>In response to this latest draft, we will be going before the Board of Supervisors to make our case for the residents of Isla Vista and our tricky housing situation.  If you are interested in helping out, being a part of this effort, or need a ride please email evpla@as.ucsb.edu.

IVFP Deputy Freddy Padilla said the individual had passed out in the street after a fight. The victim was rushed to the hospital after brief questioning.</p>\n<p>“The victim said he was knocked out cold, and deputies saw blood was on his mouth,” Padilla said. “The officers noted that the victim appeared highly intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>An hour later, deputies responded to another fight that began when an intoxicated man was attacked while sleeping on his couch at home.</p>\n<p>“The victim was passed out on the living room couch,” Padilla said. “An unknown male attacked him while he was on the couch and hit him multiple times in the face.”</p>\n<p>According to Padilla, the fight was instigated earlier in the evening when the victim of the fight assaulted the attacker’s girlfriend.</p>\n<p>“She was at a party and was kneed in the abdomen by the male victim,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>Padilla said because the suspect fled the scene after the attack, authorities have been unable to identify him.</p>\n<p>Officers also responded to two residential thefts over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Burglars stole a laptop computer from a residence on the 6600 block of Sueno Road at 4 a.m. Saturday morning. Later during the weekend, thieves took a camera, two camera lenses and a watch from a residence on the 6700 block of Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>In both cases, thieves entered through unlocked windows or doors. Padilla said these thefts might have been avoided if residents had taken precautions prior to leaving their homes.</p>\n<p>“It is really unfortunate that this happens so frequently,” Padilla said. “For whatever reason they leave their places unlocked or their windows open, and people are able to come inside and take their belongings.”</p>\n<p>Deputies also encountered a case of vandalism Saturday night when a Foot Patrol officer spotted a woman defacing a vehicle on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The officer stopped the vandal and questioned her, but chose not to make an arrest.</p>\n<p>“The female suspect was detained by the officer, but for whatever reason he decided not to arrest her.

However, the board concluded business after deliberations and allocations with $25,253 remaining.<br>\nINDUS, a student group dedicated to educating others about South Asian culture, received partial funding for requests made at last night’s meeting. According to event organizers, the organization is planning an event honoring Buddha Purnima, a religious and cultural holiday that commemorates the life, death and enlightenment of Gautama Buddha. </p>\n<p>INDUS social chair Natasha Sidhu, a second-year biopsychology major, said INDUS needed funding for transportation so that students could attend the off-campus celebration.</p>\n<p>“We have been talking to a lot of people and many are interested, this is a really big event,” Sidhu said. “Most of the cabinet members have cars and we would be able to coordinate rides for people. Rides should not be an issue for this event.”</p>\n<p>Board members questioned whether the event was designed to be accessible to UCSB undergraduates.</p>\n<p>“The issue this board has with the event is that it is not local, which makes it inaccessible to non-members,” board member Josue Aparicio said.</p>\n<p>However, board member Alexandra Onodera said providing financial support for transportation would in fact make the event more open to the student body.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that the off-campus issue should be an issue,” Onodera said. “They have assured us that people are going to have rides, and as a member of this board and this community, I am going to believe what they tell us.”</p>\n<p>The board eventually allocated $2,175 of INDUS’ original $2,675 request.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Interfraternity President Ernest Walker, a third-year political science major, requested funding to publish the Greek Brochure, a mailer that will be sent to incoming freshman and transfer students to inform them about the greek community.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t get funded, it won’t go out,” Walker said. “This shows all the good things that we do, all of the community service hours. The greek system has a bad rap and this is a way to get students talking about Greek Life.”</p>\n<p>According to board member Stephanie Finch, the brochure was not financed in past years because it was considered a reckless use of student fees.</p>\n<p>“I think that if any other organization came to us to send material home to students that are already coming here, we would not fund them,” Finch said. “This is not even outreach because these students are already coming here.”</p>\n<p>The board ultimately decided to reject the funding request.</p>\n<p>Board members also fully-funded Born Again Ministries, Naked Voices and Burning Skirts Women’s Ultimate Frisbee Team, while partially funding Real Life and the Chican@ Latina@ Graduation Committee.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-23416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-23416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/","id":3143,"author":{"id":222,"name":"Veronica Smith"},"related":[3142,3141,3140],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Crime Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Aside from the normal amount of alcohol-related crimes, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol dealt with an unusually high number of thefts this weekend.

In Winter Quarter, two students overdosed on heroin and nearly died.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen a year like that,” I.V. Foot Patrol Lt. Olmstead said of the drug and alcohol related deaths in the 2008-09 school year. “They were normal, everyday, good people who made a mistake.”</p>\n<p>Last spring, 1,000 UCSB students took a survey responding to questions about using intoxicants. According to the study, 79.4 percent had consumed alcohol in the past month. 13.5 percent had tried cocaine, 20.6 percent had used prescription drugs that they were not prescribed and 2.5 percent had tried opiates.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students are happy with the party scene,” Olmstead said. “Students need to recognize that there is a problem.”</p>\n<p><strong>“You think it’s never going to happen to you.”</strong></p>\n<p>Just a week from graduating in 2009, Noah Krom headed downtown to celebrate with friends.

However, the potentiality is way up there,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to clinical manager of the UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program Jackie Kurta, one of the most popular prescription drugs in the student community is Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication and muscle relaxant.</p>\n<p>“There’s easier access all around to prescriptions,” Kurta noted. “[When there is an] increase of supply, there is a decrease of cost.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said many students who use prescription medication recreationally are often dealing with underlying mental health issues such as stress, anxiety or depression.</p>\n<p>“These are pain medications,” she said. “These medications temporarily relieve that pain and it’s another form of that pleasure response that people are looking for. But they’re not aware of the long-term risks.”</p>\n<p><strong>“It was a fluke thing and a perfect storm.”</strong></p>\n<p>While there has been a visible increase in the use of prescription medications on campus, Kurta noted that one of the most dangerous trends has been a rise in opiate use. The most common opiates abused in the student community are Vicodin and OxyContin.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Chad Andrew Briner was found dead on Sabado Tarde Road in front of the recliner where he had fallen asleep earlier in the night in September 2008.<br>\nAccording to investigative coroner’s reports, Chad became addicted to prescription medication after taking pills for surgery and an intestinal disease.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_22593\" style=\"width: 202px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"182942790\" data-slb-group=\"22586\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-22593\" data-attachment-id=\"22593\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/chadbriner2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2.jpg?fit=462%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"462,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"DSC-S700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1221052090\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"5.8\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"chadbriner2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2.jpg?fit=462%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2-192x250.jpg?resize=192%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"chadbriner2\" width=\"192\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-22593\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-22593\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chad Andrew Briner</p></div></span>Chad’s father, Rob Briner, said that his son was “on over<br>\n12 different prescribed medications” for a period of time, although most were not narcotic related.</p>\n<p>“I think he found temporary refuge and happiness by way<br>\nof self medicating,” Briner said. “It was a fluke thing and a perfect storm. There were signs and symptoms leading up<br>\nto his demise. However, the people around him and available to him didn’t see it.”</p>\n<p>According to the toxicology report, two OxyContin pills were found in Chad’s small intestine and traces of cocaine were found in his blood. The immediate cause of death is listed as “Oxycodone Intoxication.”</p>\n<p>Chad was 21 years old.</p>\n<p>In addition to prescription opiate abuse, Director of Student Health Dr. Elizabeth Downing said there has also been an increase in students experimenting with heroin.</p>\n<p>“Black tar heroin is very readily available on the street and is currently quite inexpensive and very potent; many students seem to be ignorant of the very dangerous risks associated with heroin or other narcotic use due to a very narrow margin of safety,” Downing said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>Janet O’Neill, Cottage Health System’s director of public affairs, said the hospital staff has also seen a substantial increase in serious heroin abuse.</p>\n<p>“What we’re seeing at Goleta Valley … is an increase in heroin,” O’Neill said. “It’s been noticeable.”</p>\n<p>Two UCSB students, Nick Piacentini and Walker Jameson Price, passed away in the last two years after experimenting with heroin and other intoxicants. Price, a second-year global studies major, was found dead in his Summerland home in October 2008 after using heroin in combination with a number of prescription medications. The coroner’s report classified his death as accidental multiple drug ingestion.  He was 19 years old.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_22598\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1806070871\" data-slb-group=\"22586\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-22598\" data-attachment-id=\"22598\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/walkerjamesonprice/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?fit=651%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"651,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XSi\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1218017751\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"WalkerJamesonPRice\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?fit=250%2C230&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?fit=651%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice-250x230.jpg?resize=250%2C230\" alt=\"\" title=\"WalkerJamesonPRice\" width=\"250\" height=\"230\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-22598\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?resize=250%2C230&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?w=651&amp;ssl=1 651w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-22598\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Walker Jameson Price</p></div></span>Kaminsky noted that there are a few factors that make heroin and other opiates more addictive than most drugs — one of which is purely biological.</p>\n<p>“[Opiate receptors are] a natural occurrence in the body. Opiate receptors are in the brain as part of the pleasure center,” he said.</p>\n<p>In addition to being highly addictive, heroin is easy to overdose on due to the varying potency of different batches, especially when combined with other drugs.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>What’s next?</strong></p>\n<p>According to Associate Dean of Students Deborah Fleming, the university took action after last year’s deaths in part by establishing the “Just Call” campaign, which encourages students to call for help if their friends show signs of distress while partying.</p>\n<p>The C.A.S.E. Program has also adapted some of its material to fit changing needs and the Drug and Alcohol program has established more offices in Embarcadero Hall. The I.V. Foot Patrol installed a prescription drug “drop-off” box where expired or unused drugs can be dropped off anonymously and disposed of environmentally.</p>\n<p>Despite community efforts to prevent future tragedies, Rob Briner said that much more needs to be done.</p>\n<p>“What’s happening in I.V. is unacceptable and until we all stand tall … Nothing substantial will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Health Educator Michael Takahara said that a contributing factor to the extreme party culture in I.V. is the social norms theory — the perception that “everyone else is doing it.”</p>\n<p>The National Collegiate Health Assessment showed a huge discrepancy between the number of UCSB students who actually engage in habitual drug experimentation and the perceptions of student use.</p>\n<p>“[When] perceptions are wrong and exaggerated, people will be influenced by their false perceptions, not facts. Therefore, one strategy is to clear up misperceptions with actual use so people will not be falsely influenced,” Takahara said.</p>\n<p>Sara’s friend Taylor Suiter, who now serves as a Students Teaching Alcohol and Drug Responsibility intern, said friends also need to take responsibility for each other.</p>\n<p>“If I have a friend who appears to be in distress, I have no problem picking up the phone,” Suiter said. “I’d rather have a friend in trouble than a friend who’s dead.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Fleming expressed a need for more property owners and local alcohol retailers to interact with students responsibly.</p>\n<p>“Who’s benefiting from all of this partying and alcohol use? There’s a whole industry downtown,” she said. “Property owners on Del Playa get very high rent. There are lots of people in one unit and there’s a wink-wink nod-nod about partying in the apartment about damages. Shouldn’t property owners take more responsibility for what goes on on their properties?”</p>\n<p>Beth Krom, Noah’s mother, said a strong effort on all fronts is the only real way to prevent future fatalities in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Only through the concerted efforts of all stakeholders — the university, public policy leaders, public safety and those who profit by the student population such as property owners and those who run the bars and restaurants students patronize — can a positive change in the UCSB/Isla Vista culture be advanced,” she said in an e-mail. </p>\n<p>John Piacentini said he hopes students learn from last year’s tragedies.</p>\n<p>“You really need to be careful and you really need to know your limits and you really need to be aware of the people around you,” he said. “There’s nothing that you can imagine like losing a son or a brother or a best friend.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22586\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22586\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/","id":1284,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[1283,1282,1281],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Legislative Council Addresses Local Hate Speech","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Legislative Council tabled many bills during Wednesday’s five hour meeting.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Associated Students Legislative Council tabled many bills during Wednesday’s five hour meeting.</p>\n<p>Council members addressed issues of hate crimes observed against the Queer Student Union during its annual Queer Pride Week as well as a request to reallocate funds to the UCSB Middle Eastern Cultural Club. In addition to several other items, the council also debated a renewed request to instate Human Rights Council as an A.S. entity and whether to pass a bill updating the A.S. Coastal Fund bylaws.</p>\n<p>First off, members heard concerns for UCSB’s queer population. Representatives and council members addressed reports of hate crimes committed against the university’s queer population over the weekend. On-Campus Representative Casey Capachi said these occurrences of hate crimes were unacceptable and called for A.S. to make a public display of support for the QSU.</p>\n<p>“We are going to show students that hate crimes are followed-up on by A.S. and taken very seriously by this community,” Capachi said.</p>\n<p>Following this, the council briefly debated a request from the Middle Eastern Cultural Club to reallocate funds to the club for its annual Middle Eastern Fair. After being informed by representatives of the club that the event was expected to draw thousands of participants, the council reallocated $1000 of unused A.S. funds to the group, $800 for food expenses and $200 to hire a belly dancer.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the council discussed a Coastal Fund bylaws bill for the first time since having tabled it two months ago. The bill’s text provided clarifications to the fund’s bylaws, with minor updates in most sections. At the fore of the bill’s requests was an addition to the fund’s bylaws to provide the Coastal Fund chair with a $350 quarterly honorarium.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Rep Stanley Tzankov said the council should pass the bill despite his previous qualms about the honorarium.</p>\n<p>“Originally I thought we should move it down to three hundred,” Tzankov said. “If the author for this bill thinks they should receive $350, [his or her request] takes precedence.”</p>\n<p>However, council members were not moot on this point. After deliberation, the amount of honorarium — or fiscal compensation — the Coastal Fund chair will receive per quarter was cut to $300 before the council passed the resolution.</p>\n<p>For the fourth consecutive council meeting, members considered a bill to instate the Human Rights Council — a student organization established under the Office of Student Life — as a formal A.S. entity. Off-Campus Rep Chloe Stryker and On-Campus Rep Jasmine Davenport said they had been amending the bill in collaboration with the HRC.</p>\n<p>Stryker said she was determined to have the council instated as an A.S. board.</p>\n<p>“By passing the bill, HRC will have a set budget for the years to come,” Stryker said. “We’ve talked about branching out to contain more of a worldview. It’s something that we don’t have in A.S., and I think it’s needed. If it does end up [lacking membership], then somebody can [remove it from] A.S. next year.”</p>\n<p>The council tabled the bill for another week to allow further drafting and deliberation.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22200\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22200\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/","id":3114,"author":{"id":221,"name":"Ali Limonadi"},"related":[3113,3112,3111],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":153,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
