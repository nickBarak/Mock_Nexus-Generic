CSD discussed the resolution at several board meetings before it passed on Tuesday. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Resolution No. 19-7 calls for the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board of Directors to recognize the Chumash people’s historical and ongoing ties to I.V., also known as Anisq’oyo, through an acknowledgement at the beginning of all meetings.</p>\n<p>Anisq’oyo, part of the home of the Chumash people, encompasses the land that I.V. and UC Santa Barbara both reside on.</p>\n<p>I.V CSD staff members and Board President Spencer Brandt worked with Mia Lopez, a representative of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, to draft the acknowledgement and learn more about the heritage of the Chumash people.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just recognizing the past, but acknowledging those of the present and our future. We need to educate our community about the forgotten history that is our history,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>UCSB has also started using a similar land acknowledgement in graduation ceremonies and convocations for new students, according to Lopez. Multiple departments have begun to do the same at the beginning of their meetings as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s just incredibly important, I think, that we can serve as a model for something that local governments can do in whatever small way to try to do our part to rewrite history and not be silencing voices, both of the past and the present,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Annette Cordero, a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, explained how vital it is for governing bodies such as I.V. CSD to set an example for the rest of the community to remember the history of the people who occupied it for centuries.</p>\n<p>“It is healing for us. It does our hearts and our souls good to have this kind of recognition. On behalf of our, as we like to say for seven generations, our children and the children yet to come, this will have a meaning for them, so thank you,”  Cordero said.</p>\n<p>The resolution was adopted with a small amendment clarifying that the acknowledgement be recited at all meetings of the I.V. CSD, not just regular meetings. The resolution was passed with a 6-0 vote in favor and was met with a round of applause. Director George Thurlow was absent from the meeting.</p>\n<p>The full acknowledgement of the Chumash people and Anisq’oyo can be read below:</p>\n<p><i>“Before we begin, we would like to acknowledge the Chumash people, who are the traditional custodians of this land. We pay our respects to the Chumash elders, past, present, and future who call this place, Anisq’oyo, the land that Isla Vista sits upon, their home. We are proud to continue their tradition of coming together and growing as a community. We thank the Chumash community for their stewardship and support, and we look forward to strengthening our ties as we continue our relationship of mutual respect and understanding.”</i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Senate in 2013. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is the only UC student government that has not passed a resolution to divest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s resolution was authored by Letters and Science Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno and is student sponsored by Dylan Kupsh and Fatima Abdel-Gwad. </span></p>\n<p>“[W]e, the Associated Students of UCSB, direct the ASUCSB Investment Advisory Committee, UCSB, the University of California Treasury, and the UC Regents to withdraw investments in securities, endowments, mutual funds, and other monetary instruments with holdings in any of the aforementioned companies or subsidiaries thereof,” this year’s resolution states.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This resolution aims neither to condemn a country, a people, or a community nor to determine a political solution or cast moral judgement, but is solely aimed at ending our University’s support of companies that enable human rights violations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kupsh, who is an active member of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), emphasized the above idea when a draft of the resolution primarily written  by SJP was first released for public comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tonight’s Senate meeting will begin at 6:30 p.m. and will be held in Corwin Pavilion. There are only two items on the agenda: the resolution to divest and the Spring Quarter 2019 elections ballot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As this was written as a directional resolution, 50% + 1 senators must vote yes in order for the bill to pass. The divestment resolution last year </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">never came to a vote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as senators disagreed about whether last year’s resolution was directional or positional. A positional resolution requires a two-thirds majority to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate is composed of 24 senators, not including Internal Vice President Steven Ho; as of Wednesday morning, three senators have excused themselves for the entire meeting but will be sending proxies in their places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is a tie, Ho will be responsible for casting the tie-breaking vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution aims to divest from 13 companies: Boeing, CNH Industrial, Caterpillar, Cemex, General Dynamics, General Electric, L-3 Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Siemens, United Technologies Corporation and Valero Energy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents invested over $127 million in these companies during 2018, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the news that divestment would be happening on Wednesday, both anti- and pro- divestment groups created Facebook events aimed at getting more people to attend the meeting and express their opinions about the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/852504278434889/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-divestment Facebook event</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, created by Students Supporting Israel, described the resolution as an “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-Israel BDS resolution.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We oppose this resolution and we need your presence to demonstrate student opposition to this divisive resolution,” the Facebook description states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/408181696426375/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pro-divestment Facebook event</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, created by Students for Justice in Palestine, states that the resolution “is intended to create a critical dialogue about companies participating in human rights violations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the resolution has been largely symbolic, because while it calls upon the UC system to divest, the A.S. Senate has not had any actual power itself to divest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this year’s resolution notes that A.S. has invested $55.771.96 in DFA Emerging Markets Social Core Portfolio; $19,627.06 in PIMCO Emerging Local Bond Fund; $1,589.28 in iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF; $1,353.00 in iShares MSCI EAFE ETF; and $2,351.25 in iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If tonight’s resolution passes, these investments would stop, Off-Campus Senator Christian Ornelas confirmed.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution in full can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-Divestment-Resolution.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-Divestment-Resolution.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p><em>Updated [4:33 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Sunday. <em>Courtesy of SBSO</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suspects, later identified as 18-year-old Devosia Harper and 20-year-old Elijah Francis, are not locals, according to Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson; Harper primarily resides in Stockton, while Francis is from Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both were reportedly in town for Deltopia, an unsanctioned street party that typically happens during the first weekend of UC Santa Barbara’s Spring Quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two were stopped after a UCSB police sergeant initially spotted their car driving without lights on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road around 11 p.m. on Sunday, Hoover said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After stopping the car, the sergeant called in assistance after smelling a “strong odor of marijuana emanating from within the vehicle” and discovering that the driver did not have any identification. A separate sergeant then recognized the car as one that had been used in an armed robbery in Santa Barbara City on Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon searching the vehicle, police found a firearm, a brick of cocaine, Xanax pills and five pounds of marjuana with packaging, according to Hoover. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also during this stop, two separate individuals approached the deputies to report that they had been robbed in I.V. It was then discovered that the suspects in the car were the same as those who had robbed the two victims in I.V. It was not indicated in the press release how that was discovered. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the victims had been pistol whipped on his head and had a large laceration over his eye that was bleeding,” Hoover said in a press release sent out Tuesday afternoon. “The investigation revealed the suspects in that crime were the same suspects involved in the vehicle stop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full charges for both include robbery, attempted robbery, conspiracy, possession of a loaded firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Harper was additionally charged with assault with a deadly weapon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both were booked at the Santa Barbara County Jail. Harper is currently being held on a $550,000 bail, but information about Francis’ bail was not immediately available. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Senate table five times in the last six years. Each time, the meeting ended without a divestment, leaving UCSB as the only undergraduate UC campus that has not passed a resolution in line with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s resolution is expected to be introduced at a Senate meeting within the next three weeks, according to Dylan Kupsh, an active member of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and a candidate for the engineering senator position with the Isla Vista Party.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kupsh added that there is a “pretty big chance” the resolution will be introduced at this Wednesday’s Senate meeting, but declined to confirm an exact date. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked which A.S. senators are going to officially author the resolution, Kupsh said the names will not be released until the day the resolution is introduced in order to protect the individuals’ safety. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had issues in the past around Canary Mission, specifically student groups posting signs with their names and being terrorists and associating them with terrorists,” Kupsh said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “They’ll put the student sponsor’s name and they’ll say they’re a terrorist, and they’ll flyer all around the freshmen dorms.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of SJP are primarily responsible for drafting the resolution, Kupsh said. SJP decided to release a feedback form for the first time this year in order to gather students’ opinions on the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At SJP, we think that A.S. really doesn’t voice a lot of the concerns of students, and so we wanted to bring students into the conversation on, like, how these resolutions work and to get more student input on this resolution, ’cause obviously the university investments affect everyone at this university,” Kupsh added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted students to have a voice in trying to make change on this university, so we thought to try to alleviate concerns about the divestment bill, it would be a good place to allow for student feedback on the bill itself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kupsh said that SJP has taken into consideration the feedback that students have brought up about previous divestment resolutions and have used that to inform how they wrote this year’s resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest pieces of feedback SJP has gotten so far is to increase the number of sources they include in the resolution, Kupsh said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP has also increased the number of companies to divest from and added several more clauses to explain why those companies are included.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kupsh emphasized that the resolution is specifically targeting companies violating human rights and that the companies just happen to operate in Israel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At SJP, we really think this resolution isn’t really about religion; it’s about companies violating human rights,” Kupsh said. “It’s about Palestinians not being able to express what they want or having to fund their own oppression.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said at the launch on Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt recalled the first time he visited I.V. with his family and said it was “clear from the beginning that this was a place that was special.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was also clear what my parents’ opinion of it was, which was that it’s weird that there are mattresses lying on the corner, and that there’s trash in the gutters,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all know, standing here today, both as folks who have lived in Isla Vista and those who have been coming here for years, that’s not what Isla Vista is really about. But it does say something about the fact that there is a lot of quality of life issues that can be improved here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt hopes to appease these concerns through the use of SeeClickFix. By using the app as a mobile steward, users can help keep the streets of I.V. clean simply with their phones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt noted that there’s been a “rise in rhetoric” in the county that has dehumanized houseless people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really think that in Isla Vista, we here can be a model for trying to solve these problems and help them get back on their feet rather than pretending that if we just push things out of sight, out of mind, that the issue doesn’t exist,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who also spoke at the launch Sunday, took a moment to acknowledge Cesar Chavez’s birthday, and the “community building behaviors” that he demonstrated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann referenced the <a href=\"https://streetsteam.org/index\">Downtown Streets Team</a> in the Bay Area, which works toward “ending homelessness by restoring the dignity and rebuilding the lives of unhoused men and women,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They first did a survey of homeless people and found that it’s not being cold, it’s not being hungry, it’s being invisible. That’s the hardest thing about being homeless,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this program allows really a triple bottom line: to give people jobs and get them engaged, it makes your community better and it makes each one of us more connected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christina Lydick, beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista, said the program was going through the final stages of hiring at the moment. She anticipates bringing on five to seven people to work on graffiti abatement and other beautification initiatives in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers on Sunday went to work tackling the first few requests sent in by I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud to clean up the I.V. Community Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud initially utilized SeeClickFix in 2012, when he worked in Associated Students. Back then, he said, the program was much simpler, and there was no designated group working to fix the problems.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working on county issues and trying to figure out how we can make Isla Vista better with no local government back then,” he said. “We’d see what people put in and we’d try to work on them each without a coherent system and without dedicated staff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the I.V. CSD was looking for ways to launch the beautification program, they considered simpler options, like Google Forms, but knew that it wouldn’t give them the ability to collect the data that they wanted to, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once they reached out to SeeClickFix, the board found it to be the most effective and reasonably priced option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said the district spent approximately $5,700 for a one-year subscription, which included the district with two accounts, one for Abboud and one for Lydick, and the support of the SeeClickFix team in setting up and managing the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The service has improved exponentially since Abboud first used it when he was an undergraduate, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Before it was [a] very text-based website…I don’t even think it had a GPS,” he said. “It was brand new.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the program is much more user-friendly, he said, and the company has helped the I.V. CSD set up the front end of their app and design a workflow system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud also noted that it has been helpful to hear from the company about how other cities have developed their apps. For the I.V. CSD, one of the most important aspects of the app is its ability to collect data on the kind of work requests it is receiving and how many of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the long term if we had that data accumulate, we’ll just know better in terms of how we’re spending our money and what we’re getting done,” Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the work orders are limited to graffiti, trash, vandalism and lighting issues for now, the board hopes to expand it to include fixing potholes and uneven sidewalks, and even potentially partnering with UC Santa Barbara to collect work orders for on-campus problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll do things like that in the future, but we wanted to launch with what we can, with a minimum viable product, which is this beautification kind of stuff, and then we’ll move towards other areas in the future,” Abboud said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Yaeger has written several books about beer and is featured regularly in publications including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All About Beer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beer Advocate</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and appeared on NPR’s Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[My love for beer] began back in my college career, and I just think that the craft beer industry and the beer styles that are available have matured,” Yaeger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It just seems like the right time for the university to match the wine tasting class with the beer education class.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaeger was inspired to create such a class after he took a wine tasting class, also offered through the Rec Cen, when he was an undergraduate. He approached UCSB about teaching a class about beer last year, aiming to create one that would be on par with the wine class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took [the wine class] and I loved it, but personally I’ve just always been more of a beer drinker and a beer fan,” he said. “And all of the beer knowledge that I have amassed, I had to sort of undergo that research by myself, but it would have been great if I could have had a course like this myself to set me on the right path.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaerger, who is also verified on Twitter and is the author of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red, White, and Brew: An American Beer Odyssey,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> described his class as a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“way for people to really get their toes wet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you are a student… let’s just go with the premise that your alcoholic beverage consumption begins at 21 – we could put a little winky face in there. Any consumption that you may have experienced is more than likely enjoyed a very gregarious setting where the aim is to be social and not really thinking about the beverage,” he said, laughing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaeger explained that college drinking culture doesn’t necessarily foster active thinking about the beverage or its enjoyment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For example, when you’re playing beer pong or quarters or any of those games, you’re not really thinking about how much you enjoy a drink, or what it’s made from. You just know it’s wet, it’s cold and it’s gonna have an impact.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The class is open to both students and the surrounding Goleta and Santa Barbara community for $90 for students and $95 for non-students but attendees must be 21 or older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The class will interweave the history of beer with a series of tastings, which are arranged by country and region. For example, the first night will feature German or Continential Loggers, while the second will feature British ales, Yaeger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By the end, if you go to the supermarket or a bottle shop, and you see all the different brands in front of you, it’s not going to be strange and sort of foreign. You’re going to understand what those offerings are,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, attendees will taste close to 40 different kinds of beer and should bring at least two wine glasses or tasting chalices, as well as “palate cleansers” such as pretzels, bread, crackers and, of course, lots of water. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students must sign up at the Rec Cen Customer Service Center. Online sign-ups are not available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t have to love every beer I’m going to pour, but you have to understand that someone loves it. And that every person who takes this class is going to leave with a broader understanding and a passion for these styles that they just didn’t even know existed before,” Yaeger said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-76566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I think it was a positive experience overall,” Kristen LaBonte, a Life and Environmental Sciences Librarian representing UCSB at the bargaining table, said in an interview with the <i>Nexus.</i></p>\n<p>“We worked diligently to come up with language that was equitable and we were working around issues that were pre-existing and known to the union because of grievances that had been filed relating to our current contract and now former contracts.”</p>\n<p>One of these grievances revolved around salaries.</p>\n<p>LaBonte said that many librarians felt their salaries from UCSB were inadequate when considering the high cost of living in Santa Barbara. LaBonte even thinks that some librarian job applicants ruled out UCSB as a viable option because of this inadequacy.</p>\n<p>“We’d hear feedback from people that would say, ‘well, I didn’t realize what the cost of living was like,’” said LaBonte, who took a 22% pay cut after coming to UCSB from her previous position as a librarian at California State University Channel Islands.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to attract people just because of the location, which is beautiful and amazing,” she added. “But if you don’t have the salaries to match it, people either won’t come or they won’t stick around for long.”</p>\n<p>To remedy this situation, the union reached a deal with UC that would guarantee an “annual increases for all represented librarians, with a total cumulative benefit of approximately 22-26% over five years,” according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Temporary librarians, another debated grievance, played a large role throughout the contract negotiations.</p>\n<p>Temporary librarians are librarians who are only hired to work a set duration of time at their respective place of employment.</p>\n<p>Coinciding with an already high employee turnover, LaBonte said that she and other library representatives worked with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) to improve the conditions of temporary librarians.</p>\n<p>Although the situation with temporary librarians was not completely resolved, the union, along with input from UCOP, was able to partially amend their new contract to prevent future abuses from UC libraries, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>“We tried our best to get some wording in for the issue with temporary librarians. UC occasionally hires temporary librarians and the contract says that it’s not supposed to be for permanent work,” LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>“When that person leaves, who is going to fill in the gap?” LaBonte raised about the issue.</p>\n<p>When a temporary librarian leaves, another one is hired to replace them. This process oftentimes repeats itself multiple times, depleting the library of resources used to rehire and train new librarians, LaBonte added.</p>\n<p>Similar to temporary librarians, academic freedom among UC librarians saw improvement, but was ultimately left out of the new contract. Academic freedom, according to the <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/position/academic-freedom\">union’s website</a>, “is based on the idea that the free exchange of ideas on campus is essential to good education.”</p>\n<p>After introducing academic freedom during the bargaining process, LaBonte said that UC immediately dismissed it, reasoning that academic freedom would not be a “good fit” in the contract.</p>\n<p>“That news rippled far and wide. I was hearing from colleagues all over the country that they had heard what was going on here. So that was also some bad publicity,” she said.</p>\n<p>Although academic freedom was left unincorporated in the new contract, Labonte claims that she and fellow union representatives reached a deal with academic freedom.</p>\n<p>“We did get [UC] to verbally agree that they would be incorporating the academic freedom policy protections,” she said, emphasizing that the inclusion of a verbal agreement was paramount, as “basically all of the academics on campus did not have academic freedom protection” until this new policy takes effect.</p>\n<p>However, in order for the academic freedom policy to go into action, it will still have to undergo a 90 day system-wide review, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Another component of the new contract was professional development. Although funding for librarians at UCSB is distributed on a per-capita (campus) basis, this was not a uniform practice, according to LaBonte. Other UC libraries distribute money on a first come, first serve basis, which she deems is an unfair practice to UC librarians.</p>\n<p>With the new contract, however, all UC libraries will operate on a per-capita basis, ensuring a fair and equal amount of funding is available to each library.</p>\n<p>LaBonte stressed the importance of this new practice, adding that this funding allows librarians “to go and present at conferences and participate with professional organizations.”</p>\n<p>Other small victories were piled into the contract as well, LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>For example, if a librarian falls ill during a vacation, they can opt to use sick leave instead of their vacation time. Also, librarians are now guaranteed up to thirty days of sick leave which can be used for “baby bonding”, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, some demands did not get any ink in this cycle’s contract, and librarians will have to wait until the next round of contract negotiations for further demands to be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>Sabbaticals and eligibility for housing assistance programs, for example, were left unsupported by the new contract, as well as “grievability for denials of flexible work arrangements,” according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Overall, the union deemed this contract a success, highlighted by a post on their website: “This is not an April Fools joke! UCOP has been notified; the new MOU is officially in effect.”</p>\n<p>LaBonte emulated a similar sentiment, notably her enthusiasm for an overwhelming number of wins in this cycle of negotiations.</p>\n<p>When asked why she wanted to represent UCSB at the bargaining table, LaBonte’s answer was simple.</p>\n<p>“I got my bachelor’s degree here in geography in 1999. So I’ve been working in and out of this library since 1994. I love UCSB. I’m a lifelong Gaucho,” she said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The same feeling happened for me last year when we [started] Sunfest and students showed up!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SunFest, nicknamed “A Warm Up for the WarmUp,” is a festival hosted in Storke Plaza from 3  p.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and was put together for the first time last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our biggest hope is that students are safe and they have choices,” Armistead added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead also wrote that many of the alternative events were planned in “close consultation” with students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeike Meijer, who serves as the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) within Associated Students, said her office was particularly focused on education when preparing for Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In coordination with the Alcohol and Drug Program, the office put together naloxone trainings for students to learn how to respond to opiod overdoses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her office also partnered with SBSO and UCPD to host a Pizza with the Police event at Woodstock’s Pizza from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, the EVPLA office will host a town hall at Pardall Center from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. for community members to debrief Deltopia and discuss any concerns they might have had. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We basically just tried to fill up this week with as many events as possible in the spirit of education and prevention and providing resources,” Meijer said. This is the first time the EVPLA office has put together a prevention week, she said, and she hopes that the next EVPLA will continue to grow the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer has also been working with UCIV, a volunteer program to assist students when they’re out and about during Deltopia, to set up the hydration stations in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said he appreciates the work the student-led initiative has done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am a big supporter of UCIV. I see the program as a valuable way that students have taken more responsibility over the IV community, and promoted a culture of greater safety during large events,” Brandt wrote in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt himself has volunteered with UCIV in the past, and has “enjoyed seeing the love and appreciation from students when we have handed out water, snacks, and condoms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking on Deltopia as a whole, Brandt echoed sentiments by Hoover, Armistead and Meijer that keeping I.V. safe is a community effort. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the past few years, the trend towards fewer arrests and citations that we’ve seen are a testament to the work that students, law enforcement, and the community have done to try to change the culture in IV,” he wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer agreed, attributing the improvements in safety to the sheer number of organizations working together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of different people who are making an effort to have Deltopia be safe and have it be local, and have it be like a community event,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s safe and it’s local, then everyone who’s there is truly caring about the community because it’s our home. No one wants to make a mess in their own home.”</span></p>\n<p><i>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe contributed reporting.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

They recounted how excited some students were about the visibility of the trans flags at the fair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[That excitement] was really affirming for us, as the RCSGD, who has been working really diligently and providing trans visibility on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center is also hosting several workshops throughout the week on interpersonal violence and sexual violence. Students will be able to attend discussions in a safe space to talk about their identities and personal experiences, along with issues facing their communities, Solis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD will be offering resources and paperwork for students who wish to legally change their name and/or gender on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The week will be ending with the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth annual Transgender Day of Visibility Celebration, sponsored by the Santa Barbara Transgender Advocacy Network</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aryn Amezcua, a third-year UCSB student and Trans Task Force Advocacy Coordinator for the RCSGD, said the week has had a great impact on the community so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people who come through, they thank us. They’re like, ‘We really like this, we needed this,’” Amezcua said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center also partnered with Richie’s Barber Shop in Isla Vista for a Beat and Barber event, where the shop provided free, gender-affirming haircuts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m familiar with the movement and I support it and I wanted to show my support. Everyone’s been really happy about it,” said Richie Ramirez, owner of Richie’s Barber Shop.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other businesses such as gc2b also worked with RCSGD to show support for the community. Gc2b, a trans-owned company dedicated to providing safe binding options for trans masculine people, donated eight chest binders to be given out as raffle prizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The RCSGD managed to organize a large week of events due to the dedication of passionate people [students and staff] who wanted to create a vibrant and welcoming campus for the trans community,” Solis said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope this week creates momentum for other UCSB programs, departments, and student organizations to ask within their own spaces if trans students, faculty, and staff are represented and have a voice.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB as a whole has been working on fostering more support for transgender students, according to Solis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) recently introduced a new support group dedicated to trans and non-binary issues and experiences. The group, called TRANSformative, allows members to discuss issues related to transitioning, misgendering, bodies, relationships, medical care, transphobia and general life topics, according to the C.A.P.S. website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solis finds that UCSB has taken strides to create resources tailored to the trangender community but continually hears from students that more all-inclusive restrooms, medical access and curriculum are needed to support the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think more access to healthcare would be great, especially for trans students it can be very expensive.

Naloxone is a medication that temporarily blocks the opioid receptors in the brain and keeps the opioid from being able to attach to those receptors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the training, free Naloxone nasal spray kits were handed out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>About 45 students and community members were present at the first training on Tuesday. The second training will be held on Thursday, April 4 at 7 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The start of the trainings follows a public health announcement sent out by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead on March 20. The announcement said that in the past few weeks, “three Isla Vista residents suffered from an apparent overdose of opioids,” and while two were revived with the use of Naloxone, the third did not survive, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>UCSB’s Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada later clarified to the <em>Nexus </em>that the overdose resulting in death did not occur in I.V. , and the individual was not an I.V.  resident, as had been stated in the announcement sent out to all UCSB students.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The trainings, however, were not held as a result of the most recent overdoses, according to Angie Bryan, the recovery program manager and a recovery specialist for UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program. In fact, planning for the trainings has been in the works for a little over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan first proposed an overdose prevention protocol to Student Health during March 2018, and the standing order was approved by the director of behavioral health in October of 2018, Bryan said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan was approved for a Naloxone grant through the California Department of Public Health’s Naloxone Distribution Project in November 2018, and received a supply of Naloxone in December 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan led Tuesday’s Naloxone training in the I.V. Community Room.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve been a counselor at UCSB for almost 15 years,” Bryan said at the beginning of the training. “Naloxone is something I’m really passionate about in terms of making sure that we get it into as many hands and homes as possible because I think it’s important for students to feel empowered to do something.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Students are the ones that are gonna be there in those first moments that an overdose might happen.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan discussed preventative measures that students could take, such as using fentanyl test strips and various drug testing kits that can test for a range of substances, along with how to reduce the risk of using certain substances.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>She then asked attendees for what they think signs of an overdose are, to which attendees responded with an individual being unresponsive, having pinpoint pupils and having discoloration of the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But even after Naloxone is administered, 911 still needs to be called, Bryan explained.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan demonstrated the use of Naloxone by asking an attendee to volunteer to lie on the ground acting as an individual who overdosed. She then went through the hypothetical motions of using the nasal spray on the volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan said that all law enforcement officers and paramedics in I.V. carry Naloxone, including UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol, and emphasized that a person who calls law enforcement in response to an overdose cannot be charged with a misdemeanor crime of possession or being under the influence.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, that is not the case for felony-type charges, Bryan said. For example, if one has an excessive amount of drugs that seems like an intent to sell, law enforcement could investigate that.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jeike Meijer, the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA), collaborated with Bryan on the trainings after Bryan received the Naloxone grant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“We sat down, we had a meeting, we kind of tried to think about when would be the best time to have [the trainings], and we thought before Deltopia was the best,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer said preparing students for overdose situations as opposed to just discouraging drug use is a more effective route for keeping students safe.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I think it’s really important to not just say ‘don’t do drugs,’ because people will do it, and it’s good to know how to be safe in the case of an emergency,” Meijer said. “Even if you don’t think that you’ll be using opioids, you might have a neighbor, or a housemate [who does].”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer added that the public health announcement sent out to UCSB students which mentioned the recent opioid overdoses reiterates the necessity of Naloxone trainings.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m hoping that conversations and de-stigmatization… will allow people to get the help they need.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Along with Bryan, Meijer also hopes to help with more Naloxone trainings in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Angie had all of the information and all of the knowledge to bring,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s always people working on projects and there’s always someone who’s going to know more than you, and you have to know when to step back and let them take the wheel but give them all of the power you have,” Meijer said. “I don’t know how to do the trainings, but I can give the space.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

According to the report, the CoC interpreted this data with the help of new technologies involved in the count and demographic information provided from the New Beginnings Safe Parking Program.</p>\n<p>The program provides support and safe overnight parking for houseless individuals or families living in their vehicles, <a href=\"https://sbnbcc.org/safe-parking/\">according to the official Safe Parking page on the New Beginnings Counseling Center’s official website. </a></p>\n<p>The report also revealed, through survey questions about individuals’ last permanent residence, that the majority of the houseless population is local – meaning those individuals became houseless while living in Santa Barbara. Over 75% of current houseless people became houseless during their time of residence in Santa Barbara and 60% have resided in the county for more than 10 years, if not most of their lives.</p>\n<p>In response to the count, the County is currently drafting a plan to address houselessness, according to the count press release.</p>\n<p>“More and more, you’ll read about how the state of California is actually starting to really invest in solutions to homelessness and affordable housing,” Emily Allen, program director at United Way of Northern Santa Barbara County, said. “They are also requiring that communities have you know a P.I.T. count and that they have a plan in place and that they have strategies for evaluating how effective programs are.”</p>\n<p>The count is conducted by community volunteers recruited by the Northern Santa Barbara County United Way Home for Good, the organization which carries out the count, according to the press release. Volunteers attended a training session and then set out for the count at 5 a.m. on Jan. 2. This year, almost 450 volunteers showed up for the count in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Volunteers conducted “complete counts” and surveys, in which the volunteers, sometimes with the help of homeless guides, covered every census tract in the county, save for the Channel Islands and certain parts of the Los Padres National Forest.</p>\n<p>“Everybody is trained to either administer the survey where we ask people certain HUD-required questions, or if [a homeless person] says ‘I don’t wanna do the survey’ you’re still on your smartphone using an app,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>Volunteers could also conduct observational surveys instead of direct surveys and questioning in cases where houseless people were not comfortable answering questions.</p>\n<p>Surveying the houseless population provides insight about the conditions of houseless across communities, Allen said.</p>\n<p>“This surveying helps us to understand… who’s experiencing homelessness is fairly similar from community to community,” she said.</p>\n<p>The surveys also help United Way to better understand the varying needs of houseless individuals and how to best help them, Allen said.</p>\n<p>“We also know that the solutions are housing and supportive services and a lot of the people that do survey, they do need different types of supportive service with their housing,” she added.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County also took part in the 100,000 Homes Campaign, a country-wide effort in 2011 to create “by-name” lists of houseless people, pinpoint who the most vulnerable populations, and to ultimately house 100,000 people, Allen said.</p>\n<p>Allen and other community organizations in the Santa Barbara County “were a part of that effort… and from that we’ve continued feeling like it was important to have a lot of volunteers engaged in the Count and make sure that we were really getting information about what was going on in our community,” hence the creation of the SB County’s Home for Good program.</p>\n<p>Following the first count in 2011, one goal of the program has been to keep people engaged in a plethora of ways even after the official P.I.T. Count, in ways that will hopefully address the needs revealed by the report.</p>\n<p>“So I would say [the P.I.T Count is] not just for the federal government,” Allen said. She stated that “more and more it’s also the state government” that has begun taking a closer look at the roots and solutions to houselessness.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/","id":3720,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[3719,3718,3717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Gloves, buckets and trash grabbers will all be provided to you free of cost. You might not be able to clean <i>everything</i>, but it’s the thought that counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Food Not Bombs</strong></p>\n<p>Food not bombs is back with another opportunity to cook a free meal for your community! Even if Food Network wasn’t your go-to in the days before Netflix, don’t hesitate to dip your toes in the cooking world to make some food for a good cause! The event takes place this Sunday from 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. At 2:30 p.m., you’ll begin cooking preparations at 777 Camino Pescadero. At 5 p.m., you’ll serve food to the community at Little Acorn Park and return to 777 Camino Pescadero at 6:15 p.m. to clean some dishes. They are in regular need of volunteers, so do the community a favor and brandish that ladle. There is no sign up – all you have to do is show up. Think of it like crashing a class.</p>\n<p><strong>Engineers Without Borders</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s be real, we all know Hana Kitchen probably cooks better than your housemates. If you’d like to treat yourself with a meal out, you can easily kill two weeds with the same whacker by showing up to Hana Kitchen anytime this Friday from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. Some of the proceeds of your chicken bowl will be donated in support of the Engineers Without Borders project. With chapters in Rwanda and Kenya, the Engineers Without Borders plan on taking a trip to Panama this summer, so rip those chopsticks apart and get smackin’!</p>\n<p><strong>MAPAS</strong></p>\n<p>MAPAS, or Making Adventures Possible for all Students, is hosting a kayaking event this Friday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Fluency in swimming is recommended, but nobody will look twice if you show up in your floaties. In order to participate, check in at the UCSB Adventure Program station near Campus Point to pick up a kayak and celebrate the start of this glorious Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p><strong>SBKlub</strong></p>\n<p>If blasting Billboard’s Top 100 songs for 24 hours straight isn’t your kind of gig, then SBKlub might offer the perfect Deltopia alternative. If you like food, dancing, the beach or honestly anything, then this event might grab your eye – or your tongue – depending on how much of a palate you have for potluck. The event will take place at Goleta Beach this Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The current forecast is upper 60’s and mostly cloudy – perfect for a potluck.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/vista-point-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/vista-point-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/vista-point-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/vista-point-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/vista-point-16/","id":4189,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4188,4187,4186],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Spokesperson Clarifies Opioid Overdose Death Did Not Happen in I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada confirmed Wednesday that the administration had misidentified the location of the overdose-related death in the email.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been no deaths due to drug overdoses in Isla Vista during the past few weeks, in contradiction to an email sent out to all UC Santa Barbara students two weeks ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email, which was sent out on March 20 as a public health announcement, stated that three I.V. residents had overdosed “during the past few weeks.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-08/deputies-deploy-naloxone-for-second-time-in-24-hours/\">Two were revived</a> with the use of Naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug.
