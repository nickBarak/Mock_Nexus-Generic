However, women at UCSB, especially those seeking tenured positions in the sciences, find that balancing children and a career can be a nearly impossible road to travel.</p>\n<p>Only seven of the top 100 paid employees at UCSB last year were women, and four of them work in the sciences, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. These male-dominated departments traditionally pay the most at UCSB, as they receive the most grants and other funding.</p>\n<p>Many think that women are less involved in these departments due to a lack of interest. But for the past three decades, the United States has made a concerted effort to attract women to the sciences and other competitive fields. Today, women earn over 50 percent of all Ph.D.s, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>However, a 2009 study of the UC system by UC Berkeley and the Center for American Progress showed that women do not often attain academic research positions in STEM and, when they do, are more likely to quit before obtaining tenure.</p>\n<p>Findings showed that family formation accounts for the “largest leaks in the pipeline.” Women in the sciences who are married with children are 35 percent less likely to enter a tenure track job after receiving a Ph.D. than their male counterparts.</p>\n<p>Single women without children are, on average, as successful as married men with children in attaining a tenure track position.</p>\n<p>According to Eileen Boris, feminist studies professor and hull chair, motherhood and the demands of STEM are often incompatible.</p>\n<p>“Women have not been encouraged in these fields,” Boris said. “That’s partially because of the 24/7 kind of workload in which men more often have other household members to pick up the slack.”</p>\n<p>Diane Mackie, a mother and psychology professor, is a testament to the difficulties of balancing a work and home life. UCSB hired Mackie in 1984, the same year she graduated with a M.A. and doctoral degree from Princeton University. Mackie waited until she had tenure and was a full professor before she had her two sons, who are now 11 and 14 years old.</p>\n<p>“It’s always a trade off,” Mackie said. “Instead of being a superstar professor and a supermom, you are sometimes stuck being a ‘good enough’ mom and a ‘good enough’ professor.”</p>\n<p>According to Mackie, aspiring tenure-trackers must establish themselves in their field early on. However, with evidence that fertility issues and diseases such as autism are linked to giving birth at an older age, less women may be willing to delay child bearing in the future.</p>\n<p>Mackie added that even women who are established in their field and have strong support systems at home have difficulties managing their time.</p>\n<p>“Even with the most liberal, equal-minded guy, women still have the babies,” said Mackie. “There is no ‘good’ time for that in a career.”</p>\n<p>Although some overcome the challenge of having families while working as professors and researchers, social norms prevent many females from acting competitively to get the best pay and the best jobs.</p>\n<p>UCSB regularly matches offers that professors get from other institutions. However, if UCSB is not interested in paying the employee more to keep them at the university, the individual has to take the new job. According to Mackie, many women are hesitant to consider moving their family.</p>\n<p>“Men are more likely to put themselves on the market,” she said. “I suspect that women don’t like to play that game as much.”</p>\n<p>Barbara Prezelin is one of the top paid women at UCSB and a 37-year veteran of the Dept. of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology. She said that she has petitioned to receive earned bonuses, but added that many females do not act as aggressively to get higher pay when it is deserved.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_30434\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">[media-credit id=13831 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1299171316\" data-slb-group=\"30428\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-30434\" data-attachment-id=\"30434\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/ns4aug10_stemcell-7-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=1302%2C1090&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1302,1090\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1280341838\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"31\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"NS4Aug10_StemCell (7)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=888%2C743&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7-250x209.jpg?resize=250%2C209\" alt=\"\" title=\"NS4Aug10_StemCell (7)\" width=\"250\" height=\"209\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-30434\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C857&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=120%2C100&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?w=1302&amp;ssl=1 1302w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-30434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A female scientist transfers cell media in a UCSB lab earlier this year. </p></div></span>“I do think that male colleagues are far more likely to self advocate for accelerations in promotions which leads to higher pay scales and/or go [through] the trouble to look for possible jobs elsewhere in order to leverage for higher retention pay,” Prezelin said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>According to Boris, all women in academia, regardless of what institution they work at, what department they are in or how aggressively they pursue fair pay, are at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>“It isn’t that women are being discriminated against as individuals, it’s the way the structures are set up at this point,” she said. “The structures represent the ideal worker as the unencumbered individual. More men have been unencumbered individuals.”</p>\n<p>However, work cultures at UCSB were markedly worse for women a mere 14 years ago. In 1997, Professor Yolanda Broyles-Gonzales pressed charges against the university after a study showed that UCSB was the ninth worst offender of unequal pay for professors in the nation. Broyles-Gonzalez, who is now a professor at the University of Arizona, eventually settled out of court and became the first woman in history to win a gender pay equity lawsuit against the UC system.</p>\n<p>“The lawsuit has been very important in my life, for many reasons. The outcomes were many,” Broyles-Gonzalez said in an e-mail. “One of the conditions of my settlement was the establishment of a Gender Equity Review at UCSB for women faculty.”</p>\n<p>Since the settlement, administrators UC-wide have tried to reduce gender gaps and ease the strain on working mothers. But has it worked?</p>\n<p>“It’s only been in the past ten years that [work cultures have] changed here in the UC system,” Ricardo Alcaíno, director &amp; title IX officer at the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment, said. “That’s because in the last ten years, there has been such a huge number of influx of not only females into academia and doctoral programs but also males that don’t want to give up their entire life. They want to be multi-dimensional, not one-dimensional.”</p>\n<p>UCSB initiated the Breastfeeding Support Program in 2007 with grant money from the Orfalea Foundation. Five private rooms on campus are available where lactating mothers can feed their children or access breast pumps.</p>\n<p>“It’s another way to encourage faculty … to get their child, nurse their child or another one of their spouses can come by with the child, they nurse and be on their way,” Alcaíno said.</p>\n<p>According to Liz Molina, Breastfeeding Support Program organizer and UCSB human resources office manager, approximately 30 women take part in the free service.</p>\n<p>“It is convenient and it’s a lot nicer than the other options where someone is pumping in the bathroom or in their car,” Molina said. “Pumping takes a long time … so you do want privacy.”</p>\n<p>In 1991, the university’s children services expanded into West Campus. Today, the Orfalea Family Children’s Center and Infant and Toddler Center work with more than 200 children ranging from ages three months to five years.</p>\n<p>Leslie Voss, director of UCSB Childhood Care and Education Services, said 55 percent of the parents who bring their children to the centers are faculty and staff. Voss added that the center staff do what they can to help ease the strain on working parents.</p>\n<p>“Their children’s needs always come first and obviously are the top of the list of priorities,” she said. “But the demands of work, whether as a staff member or faculty … is very challenging.”</p>\n<p>According to Voss, the centers cater to the needs of parents by extending hours during exam weeks, providing parent support groups and assisting families during times of crisis.</p>\n<p>Academic climates have also adapted to the needs of working parents. For example, faculty meeting times are no longer scheduled at 4 or 5 p.m., the prime time for picking up children from school. The university also “stops the clock” for those on the track to tenure, allowing individuals to take anywhere up to a year off in order to care for new children or elderly family members.</p>\n<p>However, while Boris said UCSB has certainly made efforts to assist female faculty with children, it simply isn’t enough.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is doing a good job in trying to stop the clock for those dealing with family pregnancy, taking care of newborns and adopting children,” Boris said. “But the work cultures haven’t changed.”</p>\n<p>Mackie added that the work climate has changed for the better in recent years, but that “little things … can make it harder.” She said that UCSB does not offer camps during most holidays and the university’s quarter system does not align well with other school’s calendars.</p>\n<p>“How much easier it would be to have spring break — or even one week of it — align with the kids’ spring break,” Mackie said.</p>\n<p>Wilder said maintaining the current level of child care available for UCSB staff and faculty is imperative. She added that infant care is needed by many more UCSB employees. But, because infant care is high-cost and the university is dealing with a budget crisis, Wilder said infant care probably will not be expanded without a subsidy for the child care center.</p>\n<p>“I really think that if the UC system saw child care as an essential service it provides to its working employees and students, as opposed to operating the child care centers as business models, we could have more confidence in the continued high quality, accessibility and affordability of the care our children receive,” she said.</p>\n<p>However, there is also a more personal side to the story. With her busy schedule, Wilder said having fun and enjoying family time is often lost in everyday endeavors.</p>\n<p>“Another challenge is the emotional question of whether we are doing the right thing, whether we are making the right sacrifice — sacrificing time home with the kids when they are young for working in a job I enjoy in order to make enough money to continue living in Santa Barbara,” she said. “That sometimes can be very stressful to reflect on.”</p>\n<p>Alcaíno said although academia is rooted in male-centric traditions, systematic changes are inevitable with an influx of working mothers and a change in family dynamics.</p>\n<p>“In the next five to ten years, the cultures will start changing by the numbers — sheer numbers,” he said. “There will be a change in the chemistry of the culture.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30428\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30428\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/","id":3528,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3527,3526,3525],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Excuse me, Mr. Regent, sir…","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Our editorial board is publishing this statement to the Regents in hopes of getting an important message through their thick skulls: California’s youth is barely able to attend the UC at present fee...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Our editorial board is publishing this statement to the Regents in hopes of getting an important message through their thick skulls: California’s youth is barely able to attend the UC at present fee levels.</p>\n<p>“Who cares?” You may say to yourself. “That’s been the case for the last two decades.”</p>\n<p>As part of the UC we challenge you to go beyond. Don’t sit-back — reform is a participation sport, and you’re up to bat.</p>\n<p>We have entered an age where a student who wants an affordable education is considered an extremist.  Next generation’s UC students will pay more than their predecessors for less of an education than the system has ever offered. While the Regents of the University of California and their police cohorts might say that UC students are rebellious gits with no respect for bureaucratic procedure, they have criminalized our inherent right to learn and better ourselves through schooling.</p>\n<p>Our campaign for education was never a radical request. In their fight for the right to education, California’s youth has never asked for more than they were entitled. </p>\n<p>However, to our dismay, the practice of denial and scapegoating has become a staple of behavior from UC leadership.</p>\n<p>We find it absolutely imperative to remind the Regents that the UC is a public institution, and that its mission is to provide an affordable quality education to those who qualify. The Regents have thus far failed in their pledge to adhere to the California Master Plan and support California students as well as uphold their right to an affordable, equal higher education decades ago.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, students braved brandished weapons and pepper spray in a commendable but likely futile effort to return balanced decision-making to the UC.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in modern times, our students are persecuted, pepper-sprayed and taunted with handguns whenever they voice their discontent.</p>\n<p>At yesterday’s meeting, a police officer pulled a pistol on student protesters. While circumstances are still unclear, the fact of the matter is that a UC police officer pointed a deadly weapon at unarmed students whose only request was to be offered an affordable education.</p>\n<p>Although police presence was requested in the case the protest went awry, yesterday’s violence between law enforcement and students is indicative of a larger desperation that has now enveloped the entire UC system.</p>\n<p>Not only did last year’s 32 percent fee increases break the bank, but Mark Yudof now proposes to add an additional eight percent to that number and raise the total cost of a public education in California to an unprecedented 40 percent over the last two years.</p>\n<p>How far can our pockets stretch? How long can UC executives reach into them to pay for the state’s fiscal mismanagement?</p>\n<p>We understand that money is scarce and times are hard — not just for the UC, but for the nation as a whole. However, this does not excuse a lack of UC investment into the classroom. We are the next generation, and we demand the same access to public education that was given to the generations before us.</p>\n<p>The Board of Regents has consistently passed responsibility for this injustice onto the state, declaring their hands and tongues tied in addressing the matter. But denial can only go so far.</p>\n<p>We have some words for the UC executives who have failed to take the students’ interests into account: take responsibility for your failure to represent us in this economic crisis. Take responsibility for the overwhelmed parents and students, the poorly paid professors, the underfunded programs, the lack of campus resources and the packed classrooms. Recognize that you are indeed the upper echelon of a decision-making process that trickles down into real world consequences for all the students you pledged to serve when you took your position. Realize your potential to change the situation for the better and to ease the sting of the recession for California citizens who deserve an education.</p>\n<p>Students: realize your responsibility to ensure that this change happens. Keep your elected representatives honest, both for your sake and the sake of subsequent generations. Silence is consent in this case, and unless you are enthusiastic about forking over more of your money to the UC Regents, we suggest you speak up.</p>\n<p>Yesterday’s protest was a wake-up call. It serves to remind us of the risks our peers are willing to take to ensure our right to an accessible education is still existent. The risks, consequences and future of a declining and unaffordable UC system are real.</p>\n<p>We are delusional to appreciate the efforts of our UC leadership. Students have every reason to believe that we have been forsaken. The UC was once recognized as an accessible path to higher education; it was once considered an affordable option for a world-class education. Now, elitist values and exclusionary prices ensure that this education is only extended to the rich.</p>\n<p>The UC Board of Regents has failed you. It’s time to take matters into our own hands.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30176\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30176\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/","id":3526,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3525,3524,3523],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Friday, November 12, 12 a.m. — After a long night of drinking, two men attempted to drag their very, very inebriated brosef home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, Who’s the Drunkest of Them All?</strong></p>\n<p>Friday, November 12, 12 a.m. — After a long night of drinking, two men attempted to drag their very, very inebriated brosef home.</p>\n<p>When deputies contacted the staggering man, he did what every drunken person should never do in the presence of an authority figure — unzip his pants.

And for students like Antonio — who entered the Air Force shortly before 9/11, was dispatched to Afghanistan last summer and now awaits redeployment — war can mean something entirely too real, full of hardships and experiences that their civilian peers cannot fathom.</p>\n<p>A saddening phenomenon, Antonio said, is that even on the eve of Veteran’s Day, many students and community members question the merit of the holiday and project their disdain for the politics of the war onto the men and women who comprise the nation’s front lines.</p>\n<p><strong>The Choice to Serve</strong></p>\n<p>Dano Pagenkopf, who served in the navy from 1991-97 as a nuclear propulsion plant operator, said society often misinterprets soldiers’ reasons for signing onto the armed forces.</p>\n<p>“It’s okay to not like a cause, like be against the war in Iraq or Afghanistan,” he said. “But to take it out on individual soldiers — it’s not cool. People say, ‘oh they had a choice.’ It’s not like that. People join for various reasons … a lot of students get help from their parents [to fund their college education]. Some people can’t afford that luxury.”</p>\n<p>Army sergeant Tim Webster, a first-year psychology major who served from 2002-07, said enlisting was simply ‘the right thing to do.’</p>\n<p>“I think everybody should serve, however short the term may be,” Webster said. “The money for college was appealing. I wouldn’t be able to afford UCSB without it.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, navy veteran Matthew Lewis, who served from 2003-09, said he thought joining the military would allow him to travel the world.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t want to go to college yet,” Lewis, a second-year chemistry major, said. “It presented a good opportunity to see the world and learn something interesting, do something new with my life that my friends weren’t doing.” \tFormer E-5 naval sergeant Quincy Yamada, a fourth-year economics major whose unit was attached to an airwing onboard the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier, echoed Lewis’ sentiment.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”PHOTOS COURTESY OF Denver Dale and Quincy Yamada” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"617892915\" data-slb-group=\"29464\"><img data-attachment-id=\"29470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/war-headlines/am2-aw-quincy-yamada-dn/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg?fit=611%2C498&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"611,498\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AM2 (AW) Quincy Yamada DN\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg?fit=250%2C204&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg?fit=611%2C498&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN-250x203.jpg?resize=250%2C203\" alt=\"\" title=\"AM2 (AW) Quincy Yamada DN\" width=\"250\" height=\"203\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-29470\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>“[What motivated me was] travel and an urge to get out of the bubble I was in,” Yamada wrote in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>According to Yamada, whose unit was responsible for search and rescue, combat search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare efforts, his squadron was the first navy-helicopter squadron deployed in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Antonio, currently a third-year sociology and global studies major, said watching his friends graduate college and sink into traditional nine-to-five careers was impetus to seek something else.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to do something that was bigger than myself,” Antonio said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Financial Aid Director Mike Miller said his experience enlisting in the army deviated from the norm because he joined the military to pursue athletic goals.

It was pretty surreal.”</p>\n<p>Antonio, who joined the Air Force one week before 9/11, said he and his troop waited an additional month before they were able to watch news clips of the terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”PHOTOS COURTESY OF Denver Dale and Quincy Yamada” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"709715723\" data-slb-group=\"29464\"><img data-attachment-id=\"29467\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/war-headlines/lollipops/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg?fit=1280%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"CYBERSHOT\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1100822578\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"9.3\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"lollipops\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops-250x187.jpg?resize=250%2C187\" alt=\"\" title=\"lollipops\" width=\"250\" height=\"187\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-29467\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>“When Sept. 11 kicked off, my platoon thought it was a drill,” he said. “The next thing you know, it was real.

Additionally, the council discussed the Halloween parking situation and funded the upcoming Students of Color Conference.</p>\n<p>Although council members have hotly contended the request to form the new BCC over the past months, they decided it was a worthy addition to the association. Representative-at-Large Javier Martinez said the coalition’s ideals are aligned with those of A.S. and the University of California.</p>\n<p>“It continues in the tradition of the association’s activism and it’s about education,” Martinez said. “If we want to be the progressive campus we claim we are, this would be a step in that direction.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez said the bill was strongly supported by students, so representatives could do no better than respect constituents’ wishes.</p>\n<p>“These students came to us because they have a vision and wanted to make a difference on campus,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “I wouldn’t want to be part of a group that doesn’t let students contribute what they want to the campus.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council allocated the SOCC one-fourth of its special projects budget for the full year, equal to $4,284. On-campus Representative Joe Lee said such significant funding was warranted as the event will not only draw 1,000 attendees from across the state but also greatly empower the campus as a whole.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a good way for legislative council to represent the student body, considering the large amount of hate crimes recently [reported] in our community,” Lee said. “That is something that we as A.S. should be concerned about.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council discussed Halloween parking. According to Student Advocate General Harrison Weber, students with a night and weekend pass from UCSB Transportation &amp; Parking Services will face a two-hour time gap during which the permits will not be valid. He said this raises not only logistical issues but greater problems within the parking system as well.</p>\n<p>“At a public forum last week, we asked if they could suspend the ban for a few hours and they said that was cool,” Weber said. “But apparently outside of the forum, that was not cool. We could all get a temporary pass or drive around for a few hours, but I think the principle that they can say something to our faces then go back on it is more important.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28482\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28482\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/","id":3150,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3149,3148,3147],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sex On The Beach Polls","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Please vote in these polls about the upcoming Sex on the Beach issue, coming November 2nd.

It has a magical feel to it, like anything could happen,” she said.</p>\n<p>For others, such as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young, the affair is something else entirely.</p>\n<p>“I hate Halloween. Not so much the holiday or that people want to go out and have a good time. But I hate that thousands — or tens of thousands — of outsiders trash our community and houses and stress our emergency resources and then leave with us to deal with the debris,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Wondering how to handle your Halloween? Read on to make your holiday weekend the best it can be.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Ray Vuillemainroy, there will be 150 deputies and officers on patrol in Isla Vista in addition to 10 mounted police units.</p>\n<p>“The patrol will have mostly uniformed deputies, many of which are specially trained in crowd control,” he said.</p>\n<p>However, Vuillemainroy also noted that there will be “plain-clothed” cops on patrol.</p>\n<p>Vuillemainroy said students only have to act sensibly to stay out of trouble.</p>\n<p>“Be responsible. Have respect for others and, obviously, don’t indulge too much in alcohol. Basically, be responsible,” he said. “Everyone knows right from wrong.”</p>\n<p>“The main [policies] are still in place, that being the zero tolerance and the noise ordinance,” Young said.</p>\n<p>The festival ordinance, which has been in effect for 17 years, will be enforced from now until Thursday, Nov. 4. From 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. on the indicated days, no live or recorded music is permitted at a volume that can be heard from the street.</p>\n<p>Noise and festival ordinance violation fines range from $144 to $500, and any unpaid amounts will appear on your credit report.</p>\n<p>There are a slew of other laws that the IVFP will enforce. If minors are furnished with alcohol, the penalty is $1000 if the minor is aged 18 to 20, and $3000 if the minor is under 18 years of age. This fine is multiplied by the number of minors attending a party.</p>\n<p>Possession of an open container will cost you $102 to $500, and Minor in Possession penalties are $500 and a one year driver’s license suspension. If you’re caught drunk in public, you’ll pay anywhere from $525 to $1000, and public urination has a $270 standard fine upon first conviction.</p>\n<p>If you plan on having any out-of-town friends visit, check your lease first. Many landlords include a Halloween clause that bans overnight guests, alcohol or parties during the holiday weekend.</p>\n<p>Although the Social Host Ordinance is already in effect in Santa Barbara County, Vuillemainroy said the IVFP will not enforce it until December.</p>\n<p>“We were concerned about the crowding. If you were someone who lived on DP or Sabado Tarde and wanted to get to your apartment, good luck,” Michelle Morgante, UCSB alumna and former Daily Nexus news editor, said of the Halloween in the late ’80s.</p>\n<p>Not much has changed since then. However, in recent years limits have been instated to prevent some of Halloween’s past problems with street overcrowding and illegal parking.</p>\n<p>All cars on the 6500-6700 blocks of Del Playa must be off the street by 3 p.m. on Friday and can return at 6 a.m. on Monday. A number of entrance points to Del Playa, Sabado Tarde and Trigo Roads will be blocked to all incoming traffic for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Campus parking permits for Halloween, which also act as a Night &amp; Weekend Pass for the rest of Fall Quarter, are available online for $17.50 plus a $5.95 shipping cost.</p>\n<p>Every year, Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital is overwhelmed by the volume of alcohol-related accidents.</p>\n<p>“We’re overrunning the hospitals. The emergency rooms can’t handle the alcohol poisonings and other cases that come about [every year],” Young said.</p>\n<p>Alcohol poisoning signs include the inability to wake up, vomiting while passed out, slow or irregular breathing, extreme confusion and pale skin.</p>\n<p>If a friend is displaying these signs, call 9-1-1. Do not let the person fall asleep and do not induce vomiting. Turn the person on their side to prevent choking should they vomit and stay calm until authorities arrive.</p>\n<p>Even if a person does not die from alcohol poisoning, they can suffer irreversible brain damage.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Web site recommends that students “eat a good dinner and continue to snack throughout the night, alternate one alcoholic drink with one non-alcoholic drink and avoid drinking games or shots” as a way to drink safely and avoid a hangover.</p>\n<p>If you do wake up with a hangover, it is important to eat a healthy meal as soon as you can, drink plenty of water or juice and avoid excessive amounts of caffeine. Rehydrating and nourishing your body will get you back on track.</p>\n<p>Rhandy Siordia, major events coordinator for A.S., said keeping drinking under control prevents reckless behavior that could get you arrested.</p>\n<p>“People do crazy things while under the influence,” he said.</p>\n<p>For decades, Halloween has seen an elevated number of sexual harassment cases.</p>\n<p>“There would be blocks where you would get grabbed, absolutely, if you were a woman…it was completely person-to-person, elbow-to-elbow,” Morgante said.</p>\n<p>Danielle Mayorga, co-chair for Take Back the Night and fourth-year communication and linguistics major, said her group is working to prevent sexual violence on Halloween.</p>\n<p>“There’s a huge trend around Halloween where there’s a high number of sexual harassments but also sexual assault,” she said. “Things that I’ve seen on the streets on Halloween are people grabbing other’s asses or, if there’s a scantily clad person, people will grab them or make comments at them. Both are examples of sexual harassment and assault.”</p>\n<p>Any physical contact or sexual act without a clear, consensual “yes” constitutes sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“People have the right to wear whatever they want, however little they want, and it is not an invitation for people to grab them, harass them or rape them,” Mayorga said.</p>\n<p>Mayorga recommended that any rape victims call the 24-Hour Rape Crisis Hotline at (805) 564-3696 for guidance immediately following an attack. She also noted that the UCSB Women’s Center provides free and confidential counseling for both sexual assault survivors and friends of the victims.</p>\n<p>Although there are a number of police and paramedic stations located around I.V. for the weekend, Mayorga said that contacting authorities is, ultimately, the victim’s decision.</p>\n<p>“There’s a very large trend of survivors choosing not to report, due to a number of different reasons,” she said. “…They experience a loss of power, [and] being able to restore that by choosing whether you want to see a police officer or talk to a counselor is the survivor’s choice.”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Cori Lantz and A.S. coordinators are throwing a Halloween Film Festival at People’s Park in Isla Vista. The event will last throughout Saturday evening and will alternate between showing “Beetlejuice” and “The Ring” from 8:00 p.m. to 2 a.m.</p>\n<p>According to Lantz, the gathering will include free water, coffee, snacks and condoms in addition to access to restrooms.</p>\n<p>“I hope people come to watch movies, but I want them to know that there is a place for them if they need to sit down, use the bathroom or get water,” she said.</p>\n<p>Lantz said she estimates that 200 to 300 people will attend over the course of the eight hour event.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an Adopt-A-Block group will clean-up the streets from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday. Volunteers will meet at the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District office to pick up supplies. The program provides participants with lunch and a free t-shirt.\t\tThe county and university has asked students not to invite out-of-town friends to the event since 1993.</p>\n<p>Statistically, non residents are the perpetrators of most assaults and accidents.</p>\n<p>“When you have so many people come in from out of town, it changes the character of the celebration,” 3rd District Supervisor Farr said. “Statistically, the predominate number of arrests are of people who are from out of town.”</p>\n<p>IVFP and Office of Student Life statistics show that approximately 97.1 percent of the arrested and cited individuals last year were from out-of-town.</p>\n<p>According to Young, out-of-towners pose one of the biggest issues for Halloween regulation.</p>\n<p>“Hundreds, thousands, — maybe tens of thousands of strangers — are getting trashed, destroying our community, creating a big mess in the name of having a good time. And then they leave,” Young said. “That’s the problem.”</p>\n<p>Every year, the state and county spend upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars on policing, paramedics, hospital emergencies and other costs.</p>\n<p>“We have hundreds of police and dozens, if not hundreds of emergency personnel. This is all happening because of people who decide to come here and do that to us. As a citizen of this community, it frankly pisses me off that these people feel like they can come here, trash it and then leave me with the bill,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Yonie Harris, UCSB Dean of Students, said money could easily be conserved if the Halloween celebrations are limited to locals only.</p>\n<p>“What really upsets me and has always upset me is the waste of tax dollars — in a time like now when the state, county, and university are in a financial crisis, it is quite unfortunate that we have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on public safety, clean up, transportation, medical support, etc. for a big party that centers around drinking,” she said in an e-mail.  “I can think of so many other things that those resources could be used for.”</p>\n<p>MacIan said that, ultimately, it is the students’ responsibility to keep Halloween safe and fun.</p>\n<p>“For people in I.V., if you want [Halloween] to be good, then make it good. There’s nobody else there to make it good for you,” she said. “You can’t expect it to be Disneyland, because it’s not fucking Disneyland.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

local event, strictly local,’” now-former Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Ken Shemwell said of Halloween in Isla Vista in a 1992 Daily Nexus article. “‘[In the late 80’s] though, people from out of town came to party and trash the town, they didn’t really care. They were going to be here for one or two days and go home.’”</p>\n<p>According to a 1993 Santa Barbara County Action Plan Report, people from Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and all over California flocked to the area for the weekend-long celebration. Over 70 out-of-town schools were represented among the arrested and cited students.</p>\n<p>‘For young people in the age group of 14-26 years, Isla Vista has become ‘the place to be’ on Halloween,” the report said.</p>\n<p><strong>“Big, Destructive and Dangerous”</strong></p>\n<p>The early 90’s saw a huge increase of Halloween attendees, accidents and arrests.</p>\n<p>Michael Young, vice chancellor of Student Affairs, said he had heard rumors of the wild revelry when he started working at UCSB in 1990.</p>\n<p>“Halloween celebrations had gotten way too big, destructive and dangerous,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to the Office of Student Life administrative files, 853 of 25,000 attendees were arrested in 1991. Of the offenders, 80 percent were out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>That same year, two people fell off the cliffs and two deputies were injured while on duty.</p>\n<p>Despite growing concern from the community, Halloween of 1992 fell on a Saturday and no serious moves were made by the county or university to stop the event.</p>\n<p>That year also had the second most arrests and citations in Halloween history — 1,090 out of 40,000 attendees, 95 percent of which were for alcohol violations. Again, two people fell off the cliffs, including a teenager who fell 65 feet from the 6600 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara Sherriff Summary Reports, Halloween 1992 cost the county approximately $100,000 in law enforcement overtime alone.</p>\n<p>“It was a particularly bad Halloween that year [1992] and a decision was made, and made by the county, that they needed to, if not put an end to it, then certainly bring it down to more acceptable levels,” Young said.</p>\n<p><strong>What Caused The Change? The Infamous Playboy Article… That Wasn’t</strong></p>\n<p>A letter from Sherriff Jim Thomas to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors in September 1993 explained why he thought the party boomed.</p>\n<p>“In the mid 1980’s, the news media descended on Halloween in Isla Vista and made it into a nationwide media event. Major television newscasters and publications such as Playboy magazine did extensive coverage of the ‘party,’” the letter said. “Halloween evolved from a local holiday spirit event to the largest college party in California.”</p>\n<p>A number of Daily Nexus articles in addition to reports in the La Cumbre yearbook and The Santa Barbara News-Press also attributed the spike in attendance to a mid-80s Playboy article that listed Isla Vista as a top spot to celebrate Halloween.</p>\n<p>While researching for her 2006 dissertation on Halloween in I.V., then-UCSB Ph.D. student Adrienne MacIan said she encountered a number of interviewees who noted that the infamous magazine was instrumental in the weekend’s infamy.</p>\n<p>“Everyone told me, ‘Things got really out of control after that Playboy article,’” MacIan said.</p>\n<p>In a Daily Nexus poll issued last week, 52 percent said they thought Halloween in IV became a renowned event “In the late 80’s after Playboy ran an article on the event.”</p>\n<p>In actuality, the article is nothing more than an urban myth. There is no evidence of its existence in any Playboy magazine from 1985 through 1992.</p>\n<p>MacIan said all of the individuals who claimed they had seen the story later admitted they had, in fact, only seen a Xeroxed copy of a list. None had seen the actual article in the magazine.</p>\n<p>According to MacIan, a student most likely perpetrated the rumor as a practical joke.</p>\n<p>“There was a whole urban legend built up around this thing that nobody ever bothered to check,” MacIan said.</p>\n<p><strong>The Five Year Plan</strong></p>\n<p>“We, at times, had busloads of people from other campus come here, get trashed, trash the place…and then leave,” Young said. “…What I felt, and what certainly many people in the leadership community felt, was that we should not encourage people to be here and we should warn people that the county had made a set of judgments that it was no longer going to tolerate certain kinds of behaviors.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Grand Jury issued an investigation and, subsequently, recommended that the Board of Supervisors take action to halt the event.</p>\n<p>“…Many county government officials recognized that the Halloween ‘college party’ in Isla Vista was no longer an event that can be sanctioned, condoned, chaperoned or tolerated by this County,” a 1993 County Action Summary Report said.</p>\n<p>Local law enforcement drafted the “Five Year Plan” to limit the number of revelers that flocked to I.V. the next Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>The procedure included a “no tolerance policy” in addition to a festival ordinance that forbade outdoor music from 6 p.m. onward during the weekend, the confiscation of any costume prop that could be used as a weapon, barricading five main entrances into Isla Vista, restricting parking on Del Playa and Sabado Tarde from Oct. 29 until Nov. 1 and implementing pre-Halloween regulations as early as the first week of September.</p>\n<p>“Arrests were up, citations were down and Isla Vistans agreed it was a very different Halloween experience from years past…” Brett Chapman wrote in a 1993 Daily Nexus article. “Operational changes for 1993 included making custody arrests whenever possible, exacting higher fines for infractions and strictly enforcing a ban on live and amplified prerecorded music.”</p>\n<p>Whether increased police presence or the fact that Halloween fell on a Sunday was more influential, the weekend saw only approximately 25,000 partiers. According to Office of Student Life files, 966 arrests were made, of which 93 percent were out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>Some students reacted against the new regulations and there were rumors that an abandoned apartment complex on Del Playa would be the target of arson on Halloween weekend. However, overall, reports noted that “officers observed a compliance to the laws and ordinances that were being enforced.”</p>\n<p>From 1993 onward, the numbers of attendees decreased and stayed low for almost a decade. In 1995, only 1,750 joined in the notorious street party, and both the administration and county officials started to think that the final nail was in the coffin for Halloween altogether.</p>\n<p>“I think it actually had an effect for a couple of years,” Young said. “But then the activity and the numbers began to creep up again.”</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit id=13831 align=”alignleft” width=”163″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"298412871\" data-slb-group=\"28206\"><img data-attachment-id=\"28208\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/cop_gives_ticketjs/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=2175%2C3316&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2175,3316\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"cop_gives_ticket(JS)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=164%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=672%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS-163x250.jpg?resize=163%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"cop_gives_ticket(JS)\" width=\"163\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-28208\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span><strong>Halloween On The Rise</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly 10 years after the “Five Year Plan” was first implemented, 40,000 flocked the streets to celebrate Halloween — the same number of people that were at the disastrous 1992 event that initially inspired the stricter enforcements.</p>\n<p>According to Chancellor Henry Yang, the number of attendees varies greatly depending on what day Halloween falls on. Halloween 2003, for instance, fell on a Friday.</p>\n<p>“The Halloween celebration in Isla Vista does change from year to year, partly in response to whether Halloween falls on a weekend,” Yang said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>Young speculated that other factors may have a hand in Halloween’s resurrection.</p>\n<p>“Frankly, I think the internet and Facebook and the ability of people to communicate and for ideas to go viral and for whole communities of people to find out about something … it sort of catches on,” he said. “I think that there’s something to be said for modern social media. I think that the press also continues to dredge up things … up until recent years, people felt compelled to drive trucks up from Los Angeles to here to broadcast about Halloween. If the media makes noise about something, then people will to come and participate in it.”</p>\n<p>The Office of Student Life also “made some noise” about Halloween when it sent out a university-wide e-mail entitled, “The party is over.” The message, which included the line “There is NO party,” attempted to deter students from celebrating Halloween.</p>\n<p>However, Young admitted that perhaps the university’s anti-Halloween campaign might have, ironically, actually encouraged out-of-towners to join in the festivities.</p>\n<p>“As I think about it, some people could see [the university’s past involvement] as counterproductive,” Young said. “People want to come to something that you say they shouldn’t come to … But my sense is that these kinds of activities have grown all over the country … there’s something in our culture that, at this time, makes these kinds of events appealing for young people.”</p>\n<p>In 2004 the university took a new approach to controlling Halloween with the ‘Keep it Safe, Keep it Local” campaign. Instead of trying to deter students altogether, administrators encouraged students to celebrate Halloween without outsiders.</p>\n<p>Last year, IVFP records say that there were 25,000 Halloween attendees, a modest number for IV. However, 2009 did set a record with 1,013 arrests and citations — the third most arrests in Halloween history.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it was estimated in the Daily Nexus that Halloween 2009 was going to cost the county and sate approximately $1 million.</p>\n<p>That year, stricter parking regulations and a no-visitor policy in the dormitories were enforced.</p>\n<p>In 2004, Maxim deemed IV one of the top places in the nation to celebrate Halloween — finally bringing the Playboy myth to fruition.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said, while running for her current position in 2008, she asked if she could walk along with members of the IVFP for Halloween.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to see it for myself,” she said. “…I actually thought that, despite the crowd, everything seemed to be handled as well as possible.”</p>\n<p>Aside from several incidents of students jumping off roofs, Farr said that there “seemed to be a good working relationship between the Foot Patrol and the students.”</p>\n<p>Despite encouragement from Associated Students, the university administration and the county to keep the event local, out-of-towners still flock to the 2.1 square mile beach town every year to wander the streets.</p>\n<p>“…Everyone knows that Santa Barbara is the ultimate party spot for Halloween,” Levi Burridge, a 19-year old Fairfield resident, said in the Daily Nexus. “…This place is where I know we can all get down and party it up with everyone in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p><strong>CHECK OUT TOMORROW’S NEXUS FOR PART THREE OF THE SERIES: 2010</strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to a 1954 article by El Gaucho’s Christy Lord, students from around the state flocked to the event, which included football games between UC teams and a massive bonfire at the Cal Greek Amphitheatre. </p>\n<p>However, despite its popularity among students, references to “All Cal” in El Gaucho ended by the mid-‘60s. </p>\n<p>UCSB’s own predecessor to Halloween was a Homecoming celebration in the fall, which, according to MacIan, included the crowning of a Homecoming Queen and a bonfire rally. The event waned after moving the parade location from State Street in downtown Santa Barbara to Isla Vista in 1968, and the event ended entirely when the football team was disbanded in 1971 due to budget cuts.</p>\n<p><strong>The First of Halloween</strong></p>\n<p>The initial signs of mayhem were reported in 1962 when, according to a 1965 El Gaucho article, “there was a … disturbance between two dormitory living groups involving water balloons and mud-clot throwing.” </p>\n<p>Riotous conduct was reported in 1963 as well. </p>\n<p>“Students entered a women’s residence hall, knocked down the housemother and poured through the building,’” Captain Willis A. Lowe said in the article. “Students also gathered in groups of hundreds on street corners.” </p>\n<p>In Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History, Carmen Lodise said the first of the more modern Halloween parties also began to spring up around that time.</p>\n<p>“Starting sometime in the 1960s, locals began dressing up and attending keg parties along Del Playa Drive,” he said.</p>\n<p>However, according to MacIan, Halloween reports are strangely absent from the Nexus and other Santa Barbara community papers from 1966 until the late ‘70s — a testament that the celebration was not a news-worthy event until 1978.</p>\n<p>“Nineteen-seventy has been the most startlingly controversial year in UCSB history,” said the La Cumbre yearbook that year. With the dawn of the 1970s came escalating political tension at the university.</p>\n<p><strong>“Del Playa Becomes a Halloween Riot.”</strong></p>\n<p>The infamous burning of the Isla Vista Bank of America building in February 1970 added to the general sense of unrest felt across the nation.</p>\n<p>In a 1988 interview printed in the Isla Vista Free Press, then-sociology professor Dick Flacks discussed the political climate.</p>\n<p>“What happened [in I.V.] was that there was some kind of mass release from that need to suppress the rebellion,” he said. “When thousands of people are marching in defiance of authority, suddenly you become ‘authorized’ to reel against that authority, to express those buried feelings. And, there was an emotional, psychological release in expressing them, especially with a whole lot of other people expressing them, too.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Foot Patrol was created in the fall of 1970 in response to the revolutionary behavior in the area.</p>\n<p>“The Foot Patrol was designed as a solution to the specific problems Isla Vista was experiencing in the wake of the 1970 civil disturbances — problems, some said, that were directly associated with the lack of community relations between police and students,” Andrew Shulman wrote in a 1988 issue of the Isla Vista Free Press.</p>\n<p>Tension mounted until 1978, when students recognized Halloween as an opportunity to strike out against authority. </p>\n<p>On October 30, the Daily Nexus’ front page headline read “Del Playa Party Becomes a Halloween Riot.” According to the article, a party of approximately 600 revelers turned violent when two officers on bicycles were pelted with bottles from a balcony and subsequently entered the residence. Of the 18 arrested, seven were UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Amidst the confusion, there were scattered reports of police brutality. A Nexus reporter noted that she allegedly saw an officer grab a female passenger out of a vehicle by her hair before slamming her against a cop car.</p>\n<p>The next year, locals seized another chance for rebellion. </p>\n<p>The Nexus’ headline on October 31, 1979 read, “Calm Halloween Reported to IVCC,” but, in reality, a riot of an entirely different nature broke out. Unlike the 1978 riot, which began spontaneously, posters announcing a staged riot were distributed throughout SBCC and local high schools. According to MacIan, the perpetrators of the riot that transpired consisted of mostly high school students, copy-cats of the year before. </p>\n<p>Due to the obvious placement of the posters, police were able to plan for the events and the riot was quickly shut down.</p>\n<p><strong>“The Golden Years:” 1980-1985</strong></p>\n<p>“It wasn’t until the ‘80s that Isla Vista became a destination for Halloween. The reason for it is still a mystery,” MacIan said. “Nobody can tell for sure why going to Isla Vista for Halloween became so popular, except for those [1978 and ‘79] riots … Rumor of the riots spread and people wanted to see what was going on there.”</p>\n<p>In November of 1980, the Nexus’ Jonathan Alburger wrote, “Unlike the ‘mini riots’ which marked the last two years of celebration in the Del Playa area, Friday’s procession of costumed students handled themselves without any major incident…”</p>\n<p>From 1980 onward, the number of attendees began steadily increasing by approximately 1,000 attendees every year until 1985 — when the number spiked to 10,000.</p>\n<p>Michelle Morgante, who attended UCSB from 1985 to 1991 and worked as a Nexus news editor, said her Halloween weekends were always positive, despite the growing crowds.</p>\n<p>“It was a blast and I lived on D.P. for three years, so I had a great location for the whole scene,” she said. “We had live bands playing everywhere and keg parties were very common. Everyone just kind of wandered the streets with their plastic cup listening to great music.”</p>\n<p><strong>“All Hell Broke Loose in 1986…”</strong></p>\n<p>The 1986 Halloween weekend marked the first time that the open container ordinance was enforced, which prohibited anyone from carrying open alcohol in public.</p>\n<p>“You had to carry your cup upside down when you were walking in the street … People learned how to deal with it,” Morgante said. </p>\n<p>Despite the new restriction, that year saw a record-breaking number of attendees. “All hell broke loose in 1986 when over 30,000 people showed up, literally thousands arriving in a fleet of chartered busses from San Diego State University,” Lodise wrote. “The cops busted over 1,000 persons that weekend, nearly three-fourths from SDSU.”</p>\n<p>With the rise in Halloween attendees, came a rise in criminal activity. </p>\n<p>“A female UCSB student who thought she had been hit by flying rocks went three days with a bullet in her chest before discovering that she had been shot,” according to an Office of Student Life administrative file. </p>\n<p>That same year, a 26 year-old male sustained multiple stab wounds to the chest and two others fell off the bluffs. </p>\n<p>Due to the unprecedented attendance in 1986, the university recognized a need to reduce the number of out-of-towners. In 1987, UC officials launched the first “Don’t Come to I.V.” campaign at other California campuses.</p>\n<p>The county also leapt into action by commissioning traffic control to restrict the volume of out-of-towners. Cars rushed to the area on Friday but, by 8 p.m., the area was closed to incoming traffic and students were directed to park on campus or Hollister Road. </p>\n<p>Regardless, Nexus and A.S. records show that 35,000 still managed to find their way onto the streets. A total of 1,096 arrests were made — the largest ever for any Halloween weekend in Isla Vista. </p>\n<p>The Office of the Vice Chancellor announced in late October of 1989 that the CHP and Sheriff ’s Department would establish points on a number of main access points to restrict access to Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>These new regulations marked the beginning of a chain of restrictions aimed to curb Halloween, culminating in the 1993 “Five Year Plan,” which has lasted for almost two decades.</p>\n<p><strong>CHECK OUT TOMORROW’S NEXUS FOR PART TWO OF THE SERIES: 1990-2009</strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28132\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-25/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28132\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-25/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-25/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-25/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-25/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween/","id":3575,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3574,3573,3572],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Saturday, October 9, 11:59 p.m. — Three cops were departing from a fire scene on the 6700 block of Del Playa when an odd spectacle drew their attention.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>CSI: Crime Scene Intoxication</strong></p>\n<p>Saturday, October 9, 11:59 p.m. — Three cops were departing from a fire scene on the 6700 block of Del Playa when an odd spectacle drew their attention.</p>\n<p>A 19-year-old male had become ensnared in the yellow police tape encircling the emergency area. Trapped and confused, the SBCC student managed to envelop his entire body in the yellow web before staggering into the street with 50 feet of police tape trailing behind.</p>\n<p>Although the tangled teen insisted that he leave on his own, deputies didn’t think it was likely that he would get too far on his own.</p>\n<p>He was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety and some serious detangling.</p>\n<p><strong>Feisty in Fur</strong></p>\n<p>Friday, October 15, 11:25 p.m. — Officers were dispatched to the 66-block of Sueno after receiving reports of a 19-year old female in a fur coat throwing bottles in the street.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving, they noticed a large amount of broken glass in the road and soon spotted the fur-clad suspect. Cops sat the gaudy gal on the curb and, after she was unable to successfully complete the first half of the ABCs or even tell the deputies where she lived, called in a cop car to transport the bottle-tossing babe.</p>\n<p>She seemed docile enough…until she was handcuffed and began to frantically kick, spin and pull until the deputies managed to pin her to the ground.</p>\n<p>The custody van finally arrived and the feisty fashionista was led inside.

Finance Board allocation during last night’s three-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>The council conferred about the 1993 Smith v. Regents court case, which prohibited the use of student fees in lobbying for any particular political proposition or candidate. With that in mind, the A.S. Finance Board decided not to fund CalPIRG’s “Vote Float” parade during last Monday’s meeting for fear that the organization might align itself to a certain politician or cause.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, the aforementioned legislation strictly regulates the manner in which college student governments can regulate funds.</p>\n<p>“It has been a requirement for elected students to ensure that they don’t support a candidate,” Marquez said. “You all receive honoraria so we can’t endorse candidates for that reason. Individuals in their own name can make an opinion about something, but they aren’t allowed to attach it to their office.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council debated whether T-shirts produced with student funds should be manufactured by a single company in order to establish a standard rate and save money for A.S. in the long run.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Jamie Silverstein said the council’s budget gives representatives no choice but to lower its expectations for T-shirts they commission.</p>\n<p>“We need to be sure T-shirts are made in an environmentally aware manner and ensure that they will be cost effective, but these two things go in different directions,” Silverstein said. “The group needs to decide if they want cheap prices or environmentally made T-shirts. The group needs to decide what they want out of their T-shirts.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-campus Representative Jason Lopez said A.S. shouldn’t limit student organizations’ options by binding them to one shirt manufacturer.</p>\n<p>“A lot of groups on campus already have a partnership with different companies,” Lopez said. “They may already get cheaper prices there and if we make them go somewhere else we might make them spend more money than they would have otherwise.”</p>\n<p>The board eventually tabled the discussion.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Chloe Stryker said she was concerned that A.S. Finance Board is likely to run out of funds for the quarter.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to do,” Stryker said. “We could take away from winter [quarter’s unallocated fund] or just give away all our money in the next two meetings. If you know people that have events in Fall Quarter, have them come in as soon as possible because it’s going to become difficult to fund those groups.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27838\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27838\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/","id":3148,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3147,3146,3145],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Arnold Schwarzenegger’s allocation wasn’t enough to lift the University out of its financial deficit. According to A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Doug Wagoner, UCSB will still face a $439.9 million shortfall in 2011-12.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Wagoner said UC VP of Budget Patrick Lenz alluded to future fee hikes for UC students during a UC Student Association board meeting over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“[Lenz] danced around the fact that there’s probably going to be a 20 percent student fee increase in November and he also didn’t answer any of our questions very well,” Wagoner said. “I encourage you all to research more into the budget to see where the money’s going in our dire state.”</p>\n<p>The council also discussed the 1993 court case Smith v. Regents, which prohibits the use of student fees to lobby any proposition or candidate. A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez cautioned the council to remember its expenses are regularly audited in compliance with Smith v. Regents.</p>\n<p>“Taking a position either way on an issue is not a violation of Smith v. Regents,” Marquez said. “What is a violation is spending any student fees to defeat or support any particular proposition or candidate. However, the educational process is not a political process; I’d be putting out the message that we’re investing in the educational mission.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez questioned the legality of funding a group such as the Rock the Vote campaign, if the organization used the money to favor of a local candidate.</p>\n<p>Marquez recommended the council seek her advice when unsure whether an allocation was in line with Smith v. Regents, Off-Campus Representative and Finance Board member Chloe Stryker requested Marquez give a similar talk about the case at Monday’s Finance Board meeting.</p>\n<p>“If you had come and given that presentation [last] Monday, that probably would have changed the outcome a lot,” Stryker said.</p>\n<p>Marquez then went on to discuss the Associated Students’ role in Steve Pappas’ lawsuit against Board of Supervisors Representative Doreen Farr, in which Pappas claimed that the Associated Students had potentially mishandled registration forms during the 2008 election. Though the case was dropped, Pappas has recently appealed the decision.</p>\n<p>“A.S. and the campus itself were subpoenaed as witnesses, and we were compelled to respond,” Marquez said. “We need to comply because the suspicion is that Associated Students was conducting voter registration that wasn’t following election code. We’re potentially involved, and that’s something you should all be aware of.”</p>\n<p>Lastly, Wagoner congratulated UCSA’s recent voter registration effort on campus. As of 11:30 Tuesday night, 5,284 UCSB student voters had registered for the upcoming election. UCSA hopes to register a total of 7,000 voters by the end of the drive on Monday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/","id":3147,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3146,3145,3144],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Halloween Polls","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Check out the Nexus on the week of the 25th for a series on the history of Halloween in IV and Halloween 2010.
