The Student Advisory Board also requested a phone conference with UCOP to discuss the feedback from students before they present the changes to the UC Regents, whose approval is needed to enact the changes.<em> Maura Fox / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The policies are a part of the university’s Policies Applying to Campus Activities Organizations and Students (PACACOS), a collection of “University-wide policies relating to student life.” Jennifer Selvidge, one of the board’s members, presented the changes to the Senate.</p>\n<p>The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) is “working through an overhaul of the policy” after the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights found that UC Berkeley Title IX office was “out of compliance with federal law,” Selvidge said at the meeting over Skype.</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley’s agreement with the federal government in order to meet the federal law requirements includes that system-wide policies are implemented — the UCOP office decided that a “broader review and revision process” at the same time would be appropriate.</p>\n<p>“We as a board do not uniformly support all of [the proposed revisions]. Some of them came from our suggestions, others came from suggestions from other interested parties,” Selvidge said in an email.</p>\n<p>The board is working to ensure feedback from students during the Senate meeting and across the UC campuses will taken into account when editing and finalizing the policy changes, according to Selvidge. The Student Advisory Board also requested a phone conference with UCOP to discuss the feedback from students before they present the changes to the UC Regents, whose approval is needed to enact the changes.</p>\n<p>While UCOP is obligated to report several policy changes to the federal government by July 31, UCOP hopes to implement the full set of revisions in January 2019. However, UCOP staff turnover could delay or change their planned date for implementation, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>The Title IX Student Advisory Board is comprised of one undergraduate and one graduate representative from each UC campus. The intent of the board is to involve student voices in policy changes, to implement system-wide “successful prevention efforts and programming” and to provide UC students with a “consistent experience.”</p>\n<p>At the meeting on Wednesday, Selvidge walked the Senate through the current process of filing a report with Title IX office.</p>\n<p>She then addressed and explained each individual change that the UCOP office is attempting to make to the language of PACACOS as well as the adjudication model. The adjudication model is the process of Title IX investigations  and the subsequent recommendation of the Title IX office regarding the occurrence of a policy violation.</p>\n<p>UCOP is proposing to add language to the policy requiring campuses to use the sexual misconduct adjudication process. UCOP also proposes to formally define sexual violence in PACACOS as it is defined in the system-wide sexual misconduct that applies to faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>UCOP also proposes to include regulations to withhold transcripts and diplomas in an effort to prevent students from transferring out of the UC system until “all allegations against a student or any assigned sanctions and student disciplinary conditions have been fully resolved.”</p>\n<p>In cases like these, the student will be notified of the hold, the circumstances in which the hold can be removed and the process in which the student can appeal the hold.</p>\n<p>Selvidge presented proposed changes from the UCOP to the adjudication model, most of which outline different processes involved when students file a report with the Title IX office.</p>\n<p><b>Proposed Changes to the Adjudication Model:</b></p>\n<p>The first specification states that in instances when non-sexual policy violations occur in concurrence with sexual violence policy violations, they can both be adjudicated together.</p>\n<p>The model is also being updated to indicate that the victim in a sexual assault case cannot be denied a request for a formal investigation, even though the university can move forward with proceedings regarding sexual assault without the consent of the victim.</p>\n<p>The language of the adjudication model is also being modified to explain the role of the allowed “support person” and advisor during proceedings as well as trying to limit the role lawyers have previously played.</p>\n<p>The university is also allowing itself more time to address the sexual violence, allotting 120 calendar days from when the Title IX office notifies the involved parties of the charges instead of the previous start date of when the Title IX office receives the report, Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>The changes also outline what is included in a formal notice of charges, allows students the right to ask questions of the other party through the investigator and explains what types of evidence can be included or excluded in an investigation.</p>\n<p>The student review process of the investigation report and the structure and timing of the decision of the Student Conduct Office are also outlined in the proposed changes.</p>\n<p>It also explains that the university does not advocate for or against an appeal and outlines the process by which an appeal can be made as well.</p>\n<p>The proposed changes also require consistent training for the appeal board.</p>\n<p><em>Update: The article was updated with information to clarify several proposed changes, the revision process that UCOP is currently carrying out and Selvidge’s position. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of the article appeared on p.4 of the May 31 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-83396\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The students and incarcerated teenagers that participate in this program write stories about the struggles they currently deal with. They also draw pictures that convey their emotions in a healthy and metaphorical way, Morgan said. <em>Courtesy of Michael Morgan</em></p></div>\n<p>For the program, Morgan brings together eight UCSB students and eight incarcerated teenagers from Los Prietos Boys’ Camp (LPBC), a juvenile detention facility in Santa Barbara County. He uses theater, dance and art techniques to address issues related to class and culture.</p>\n<p>The class spends six weeks rehearsing their own rendition of Homer’s <em>Odyssey </em>from June 25 to August 4. At the end of the course, participants perform at Center Stage Theater in downtown Santa Barbara, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The program grew out of a class called “The People’s Voice,” which is also taught by Morgan and is offered during Summer Session A.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the class was to create a partnership between UCSB undergraduates and the community,” Morgan said. “It’s theater with a social justice bent.”</p>\n<p>The class is six weeks long and meets Tuesday through Thursday for about four hours each day, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>This program, which is the first and only of its kind, was started in 2011 when Morgan was looking for a way to bridge the gap between “privileged” and “non-privileged” people in the community.</p>\n<p>He said he wanted to create a space where they could interact in a way that promoted deeper communication and understanding between both sides, which is the basis for<em> The Odyssey Project</em>.</p>\n<p>“Coming from … my own background, I understand some of the difficulties people have to face if they’re not always privileged,” Morgan said.</p>\n<p>Morgan, who has been a lecturer at UCSB since1992, said he chose to focus on <em>The Odyssey </em>for his program because he felt it had a storyline that both students and troubled teens could relate to.</p>\n<p>“They become the heroes and heroines in their journey home to Ithaca,” he said.</p>\n<p>The students and incarcerated teenagers that participate in this program write stories about the struggles they currently deal with. They also draw pictures that convey their emotions in a healthy and metaphorical way, Morgan said.</p>\n<p>Morgan is the primary professor of the course, but also gets help from a mime teacher, mask maker, hip-hop choreographer, rap artist and costume designer.</p>\n<p>The location of the class alternates between UCSB and LPBC, which is located in Los Padres National Forest. This allows UCSB students to receive more context about the world and what the life of an incarcerated teenager is like, Morgan said.</p>\n<p>“There’s this location exchange, but also there’s a kind of cultural exchange because we have … the free and the incarcerated in a dialogue,” he explained. “The UC students benefit from [the program] because … [the teens and students] start to bond with each other.”</p>\n<p>Youth who are admitted into LPBC stay there for either 120 or 180 days, according to the LPBC website.</p>\n<p>“The goal of LPBC is to return youth to the community as responsible and productive members of society,” the website states.</p>\n<p>Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 are admitted into LPBC and are expected to attend the camp’s school while they are there, according to the website.</p>\n<p>Morgan said one of his main hopes is that the theater program will inspire teens who graduate from LPBC to go to college afterwards.</p>\n<p>“I usually take youth age 16 to 17. It’s an important transition in their life because … if they continue to violate [the law] basically they go to adult prisons,” Morgan said.</p>\n<p>There have been numerous accounts in which incarcerated teens work toward getting into college after completing the <em>The Odyssey Project,</em> according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>“[This program] show[ed] me that we could mature ourselves. We could work, not be lazy. We can go to college, have a good job and get good money instead of being on the streets and selling drugs. That’s not going to get you anywhere,” said Diego, a youth who attended the program in 2015.</p>\n<p>Morgan said he believes the performance the students and teenagers put on at the end of the course encourages community members and political leaders in Santa Barbara to address these teenagers in a more compassionate way.</p>\n<p>Relatives and friends of the actors, as well as community groups and leaders, attend this typically sold-out show, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The people in the crowd can “really make a difference” in the lives of the teenagers who perform, Morgan said.</p>\n<p>“Once [the students and teenagers] do that show… they’re throwing a ball to the public saying … ‘They also need to step up to us, we’re a part of that society,’” he said.</p>\n<p>This year, Morgan expanded this project to a maximum security correctional facility in Ventura County. The men at this facility range in age from 17 to 22.

During the investigation, Martinez’s charges were listed among the search results. The <em>Nexus </em>then obtained police arrest records for the charges in question.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) officers first arrested Martinez on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive in Isla Vista at approximately 11:40 a.m. on Feb. 14, according to arrest records. Martinez was charged with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.</p>\n<p>She was booked in the Santa Barbara Jail on $25,000 bail and was released around 1 a.m. on Feb. 15, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>Martinez pleaded not guilty. A settlement conference will be held in September, according to Santa Barbara trial court records.

He began his career in law enforcement in the Bay Area, later transferring to Inglewood and becoming a police chief for Moscow, Idaho, where he oversaw the city and the University of Idaho. He was also the chief of police for the City of Lompoc in 1995.</li>\n<li>Lt. Hsueh has worked in SBSO for 31 years. He’s led initiatives to provide officers trainings on responding to people with mental illness and trained over 700 officers in two years. Hsueh said he wants to improve training to teach officers to use less force and implement more crisis de-escalation training.</li>\n<li>Lt. Olmstead has worked in SBSO for 28 years and has worked in every division in the department, including the narcotics and human trafficking units. He is running on a platform of repairing relationships with the county board of supervisors.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_83337\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1473520250\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83342\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83337\" data-attachment-id=\"83337\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/sheriff-7254/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sheriff-7254\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83337\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83337\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left to right, sheriff-coroner candidates incumbent Sheriff Bill Brown, Lt. Eddie Hsueh and Lt. Brian Olmstead discuss police-resident relations and sexual assault policies in Isla Vista. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Responding to Cases of Sexual Assault in I.V.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said officers should treat survivors with dignity and compassion, as if they were members of their own family. The department does not have a single rape kit that has not been processed, Brown said.</li>\n<li>Hsueh said SBSO could benefit from referring victims to both Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, formerly the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, and UCSB’s Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education, as well as implementing green dot and implicit bias training. Green dot training teaches people to be an active bystander in preventing sexual assault.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said he believes law enforcement could provide more education to the public about where victims can report sexual assault cases, as jurisdictional issues can be confusing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Police-Resident Relations During Large Events in I.V. </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said future large events in I.V. such as Deltopia should only be for local community members because the majority of crime and citations during these events are linked to people from out of town.</li>\n<li>Hsueh suggested SBSO work with the CSD to create sanctioned events that minimize crime through crisis stabilization units and through triaging those suffering from alcohol and drug abuse. Hsueh has been on the “front lines” of riots and said police often did not act in accordance with their training because they did not give ample notice before using their weapons.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said more alcohol-free daytime events could decrease the rates of crime and medical transports because alcohol is a main source of problems during I.V. events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All three candidates unanimously expressed support for medical amnesty for overdose victims and those suffering from alcohol and substance abuse.</p>\n<p>Hsueh, in particular, expressed support for written policies that would show the public that the department’s emphasis is to protect their lives. Under these new policies, those seeking medical attention for illegal activities like drug use or underage drinking would not be arrested.</p>\n<p><strong>Candidates’ Perspective on I.C.E. Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown, who has previously complied with I.C.E.’s requests, said he would continue to comply with requests to give the agency the release dates of violent criminals.</li>\n<li>Hsueh was the only of three candidates to state that he would stop complying with I.C.E.’s orders, which he said was necessary to improve “public trust.”</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the immigration system currently needs “comprehensive reform” but said the department needs to follow the law and focus on removing violent people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Concerns Over SBSO Lack of Personnel</strong></p>\n<p>The three candidates said one of the department’s pressing needs is its lack of personnel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said the department has lost approximately 90 positions funded through the county’s general fund since 2008. He said the department has cut programs in non-emergency areas and lost several specialized units and crime prevention programs, but he hopes to bring back those programs incrementally.</li>\n<li>Hsueh agreed with Brown’s position.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the county has paid $4.5 million in overtime as a result of vacancies. He said SBSO currently needs to fill 50 funded positions, including approximately 30 sworn officers. He said the department currently lacks a recruitment plan for completing the new hirings.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-83266\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara Congressman Salud Carbajal signed a bipartisan discharge petition last Friday in an attempt to force the U.S. House of Representatives to vote on bills that would protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients.</p>\n<p>“Obviously this is a long overdue vote that’s needed, and it’s forcing the leadership to have to bring this legislation forward,” Carbajal said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"_5yl5\">Carbajal said the goal of the discharge petition is to have a bipartisan bill that provides DACA recipients with the same benefits that they have received under the DACA program.</span></p>\n<p>The petition was first proposed by Florida Congressman Carlos Curbelo in mid-May.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, 205 members of Congress have signed the petition, according to the <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0010.xml\">Clerk of the House of Representatives</a>. Overall, 218 congressmen and congresswomen must sign the petition for it to be considered.</p>\n<p>If enough members of Congress sign the petition, the document will force a vote in the House on several bills, according to Carbajal.</p>\n<p>The bill which receives the most votes in House of Representatives will be adopted under a “queen-of-the-hill” procedure, which is a special method members of Congress can use to allow a series of bills to be voted on, according to <a href=\"https://valadao.house.gov/uploadedfiles/congressional_research_service_queen_of_the_hill_rules.pdf\">the Congressional Research Service</a>.</p>\n<p>The bill that then receives the most votes will pass the House.</p>\n<p>House members can propose discharge petitions when a bill has been introduced and referred to a committee for 30 or more legislative days, according to the House of Representatives rules.</p>\n<p>Carbajal believes legislation to protect DACA recipients would pass “overwhelmingly” if it was voted on in the House, according to a press release sent out by Carbajal’s office.</p>\n<p>“There are many good bipartisan proposals to ensure that the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients who have grown up in this country, gone to school, and paid their taxes are allowed to continue living and working in the only home they’ve known,” Carbajal said in the press release.</p>\n<p>Should the discharge petition gain the required number of signatures, the four bills likely under consideration are the Securing America’s Future Act of 2018, the D.R.E.A.M.

However, candidates must run independently rather than with a political party.</p>\n<p>The meeting was adjourned before the senators could accept the board’s minutes.</p>\n<p>“My senate is not cooperating with me,” Ho said after the senators failed to approve the Elections Board minutes for the second time.</p>\n<p>The Senate’s approval of the minutes, however, is a formality, so Election Board’s decision to disqualify Morales remains legitimate.</p>\n<p>The meeting ended just after 5:30 p.m. with more than a quarter of the agenda left unaddressed because another group needed the State Street Room for a meeting.</p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Each of the backpacks on Storke Lawn represented a victim of a school shooting that occurred in the U.S., going as far back as the Columbine shooting in 1999. <em>Angelica Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Over 200 people gathered at Storke Tower to reflect on the lives of George Chen, Katherine Cooper, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Christopher Michaels-Martinez, Weihan “David” Wang and Veronika Weiss, the six who passed away in a mass murder that left another 14 injured.</p>\n<p>The memorial began with a set of songs performed on the cello while students and community members gathered around 184 backpacks, each of which represented a student who died in the 1999 Columbine shooting and in every school shooting since the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting.</p>\n<p>Each backpack had a tag labeling the name of the student who died and the school they attended at the time of their death. One of the backpacks represented a UCSB student who recently passed away.</p>\n<p>Richard Martinez — the father of Christopher Michaels-Martinez — has been a vocal advocate for gun control since the death of his son.</p>\n<p>“From the day Chris was killed I’ve been speaking out against gun violence. I was so angry and so frustrated with the way things were and the pointlessness of having to lose a child in this way,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“I’m completely devoted to trying to make this change. It’s the only thing that’s important to me,” he added.</p>\n<p>While Martinez and others spoke to the crowd, participants gathered and held a blue string that connected everyone present.</p>\n<p>Organizers handed out artificial candles for participants to hold during the memorial. Blunite, an organization created following the shooting, initially began the tradition of handing out blue L.E.D. lights during the 2015 memorial for the shooting.</p>\n<p>Artificial blue candles similar to the ones used during this memorial have also been used by students during several other memorials that have been held on campus.</p>\n<p>Briana Michael, one of the leaders of Blunite, also spoke at the memorial. Michael curated the memorial and worked with other collaborators to plan the event.</p>\n<p>Michael, who was a first-year student at UCSB when the 2014 shooting occurred, spoke about how she had been personally affected by gun violence.</p>\n<p>“We as educated youth need to push to do more. Way more than saying something on Facebook or tweet something. There needs to be more,” Michael said.</p>\n<p>Campus and community events on both Monday and Tuesday focused on spreading awareness about the tragedy in I.V. and taking action for gun control. The event series was titled “#Enough.”</p>\n<p>On Monday, organizers tabled and set up an interactive art piece in the Arbor. On Tuesday, organizers led “Coffee and Calls” to urge legislators to show support for gun control.</p>\n<p>At the memorial’s end, Michael asked participants to place their candles near a backpack and say the name of the school written on the tag.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> after the memorial, Martinez encouraged people to walk away from the memorial knowing they could take action against gun violence.</p>\n<p>“Vote, volunteer, contribute,” Martinez said. “Don’t let it stand the way it is. It doesn’t have to be like this.”</p>\n<p><em>Katie Wolf contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the May 24 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

beginning Fall Quarter 2018, which would allow students to take courses specific to journalism that are taught by trained professionals.</p>\n<p>The professional certificate program will be an 18-unit program that can be completed over the course of students’ enrollment at UCSB and will combine journalism classes already offered at UCSB, such as “Journalism News &amp; Writing,” with new courses.</p>\n<p>The classes will also be taught by new professors who have been recruited for specialty and expertise courses, according to Gretchen Macchiarella, the new data-driven journalism lecturer.</p>\n<p>“They have been really reaching out and finding journalists and educators who have connection to the industry and who are bringing in this breadth of knowledge,” Macchiarella said.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the program is to provide students the opportunity to gain specialized and modern training in the journalism field from experienced journalists, according to the program’s website.</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of the program, students will create a professional website that exhibits the skills they have gained, from gathering facts and following leads to presenting news on social media and other platforms, according to the certificate website.</p>\n<p>The journalism certificate program was modeled after the Technology Management Certificate program also offered at UCSB Extension, according to Nomi Morris, UCSB lecturer and former international journalist.</p>\n<p>UCSB Extension is a program within the school for students pursuing continuing education.</p>\n<p>The journalism program will require students to take 12 of the 18 program units through UCSB classes and six units from the Extension program.</p>\n<p>Students will be required to pay separately for courses taken through Extension, according to the certificate program’s website. The estimated cost for the total required units needed for the certificate is $1,800.</p>\n<p>Each unit of a course offered through the UCSB Extension for this program costs $275, according to the certificate program’s website.</p>\n<p>Some of the new courses offered through Extension include “Data-Driven Journalism” and “Visual Journalism,” which aim to incorporate the “cutting-edge” changes in the journalism industry into the certificate program at UCSB, Sorapure said.</p>\n<p>The “International Reporting” course at Extension gives students an opportunity to gain “hands-on experience” in international reporting through a three-phase international reporting trip, according to the program’s website.</p>\n<p>The course will take place in Spring Quarter 2019 and carry on into the summer. It will begin with a research and story preparation phase, followed by a two-week foreign reporting trip before finishing in Santa Barbara with a presentation ceremony of the coursework to friends and family.</p>\n<p>It will count toward four units for the Extension requirement. Next year’s trip is planned to take place in Berlin, Germany during Summer 2019, according to Morris.</p>\n<p>Madeleine Sorapure, director of UCSB’s writing program, and Bob York, interim dean at UCSB Extension, began planning for the program during Fall Quarter 2017.</p>\n<p>The two began by discussing a possible collaboration between the writing program and UCSB Extension. The potential for a journalism program came up as a natural fit during these discussions, Sorapure said.</p>\n<p>“It just seemed like sort of a natural certificate program because of the professional aspect of it … There’s something about it that’s very kind of one foot in UCSB, one foot in the world,” Sorapure said.</p>\n<p>Morris said she has noticed a desire among students for opportunities to further an interest in journalism.</p>\n<p>“There are opportunities in the campus to work on campus journalism, but there are only a few journalism courses that are offered in the writing program … Part of what we’re doing is trying to address that,” Morris said.</p>\n<p>The courses offered in the program can benefit students interested in all types of careers in a professional field, according to Morris.</p>\n<p>“It’s so important right now to train people in how to write for media. Even if you don’t end up a professional journalist, these courses that we’re offering, they’re really fundamental to modern communications in the professional world, whatever you go into,” Morris said.</p>\n<p>Students can begin registering for the first class available for the certificate program, Writing 24, during their pastimes on G.O.L.D.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 24, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Shut it down!” <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recently elected 69th A.S. Senate abruptly ended its inaugural meeting after a group of about 60 people stormed the Hub screaming, “Shut it down!” in what the group called an act of “civil disobedience.” The students stomped onto the stage and grabbed microphones away from the sitting senators, who had hastily begun their meeting when 11 senators and Internal Vice President-Elect Steven Ho failed to show up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In similar fashion, 15 senators and proxies didn’t show up to the final 68th Senate meeting earlier that evening. Those who boycotted the meeting did so in an apparent protest of the 12 who </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">didn’t return to last week’s meeting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the dust settled, it was another instance — the fifth time in six years — in which divestment failed to pass at UC Santa Barbara, which remains the only undergraduate UC campus not to have passed the resolution.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The divestment resolution calls for the UC to withdraw investments from companies that profit from alleged human rights violations in Israel and Palestine. While proponents cite violence in the region as a reason to divest, opponents, largely from the Jewish community, believe the resolution singles out Israel and draws its contents from the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which they deem to be anti-Semitic.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wednesday evening was intended to include both the final meeting of the 68th Senate and the first session of the 69th, along with the swearing-in of the elected A.S. executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final meeting of the 68th was supposed to pick up right where it left off — at the conclusion of last week’s meeting, where 12 senators and proxies didn’t return from a recess because the other 13 wouldn’t approve the agenda. The Senate was split over how to categorize the resolution, a distinction that would have significantly altered the necessary voting threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to accept the agenda, to discuss this issue,” said Off-Campus Senator Kristen Armellini. “To say that we didn’t want to discuss it is false.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83282\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83282\" data-attachment-id=\"83282\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/judicial-council-seats-will-be-unfilled-until-at-least-week-9/img_3217/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3217\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83282 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83282\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Outgoing A.S.

But only 10 senators were present, leading Internal Vice President Jasmine Sandhu to adjourn the meeting and officially announce that the 68th A.S. Senate’s term was complete. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish we could’ve ended this like we should’ve,” Transfer Senator Kian Maalizadeh said after the meeting was adjourned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 69th A.S. Senate meeting was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m., but IVP-Elect Ho and 11 senators were not present for the first forty minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho, a senator this year, had already communicated he would be late to the 68th senate meeting because his pass time for choosing fall quarter classes was scheduled for 6:30 p.m., according to a statement he sent to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marisela Marquez, A.S. executive director, texted Ho that all business from the 68th senate would be sent to the 69th senate, Ho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After this, I got incredibly overwhelmed and had an intense anxiety attack and could not even breathe because that would mean I would have to oversee a bunch of legislation along with elections results,” the statement read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After waiting for over 20 minutes, Sandhu swore in the 13 senators who were present. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without Ho sworn in as the Senate chair, Marquez told the senators they had the authority to elect pro-tempores to run the meeting. The senators rapidly chose Mordi Shadpour to be the first pro-tempore and Lea Toubian as the second pro-tempore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the only reason why they were chosen is because… they were the only two people that applied for that position that were the senators that were sitting there,” said Off-Campus Senator Carla Cernat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shadpour and Toubian then took the lead, directing the 69th Senate as they ratified the 2018 A.S. Elections results and approved Ali Suebert, the current A.S. attorney general, to serve another year-long term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Shadpour attempted to lead the meeting, outgoing A.S. representatives, including IVP Sandhu, stood in front of the stage, mouthing directions to the new senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incoming A.S. President Brooke Kopel was the only executive candidate to be sworn in after elections results were ratified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho found out through a text message from fellow Senator Andrea Reyes that the 69th senate had appointed pro-tempores in his absence, according to his statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This angered me because I chose my pro-temps based who I see would work best with me and be the best assets to the office and will help me fulfill my role as the presiding officer of senate,” he wrote. “I was literally sitting in the corner trying to breath while all of this was happening. I think it was really disrespectful for the senate to do all of that and take advantage of the state I was in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho stood in the Hub as the 11 senators absent at the start of the meeting walked in at approximately 8:40 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sandhu, outgoing senators Sophia Dycaico and Grayson Hernandez and outgoing Student Advocate General Jack Tannenbaum could be seen urging the 69th Senate to speed up the process of passing the motions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once all the senators were seated, Marquez took to the microphone to request that the senators who were already sworn in call for a recess to allow their peers to be officially sworn in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the senators could consider the motion, chants of “Shut it down! Shut it down!” were heard coming from the second floor of the University Center. Approximately 60 students streamed down the stairs, marching toward and onto the stage that the Senate was occupying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newly sworn-in senators hastily adjourned the meeting as the crowd of chanting protesters stepped onstage, grabbing microphones and shouting. Many senators left the Hub altogether before the chants died down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a third-year Global Studies major, introduced the group of protesters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just to let you know, this is an act of civil disobedience,” he said. “We are having a civil disobedience because we think that what’s happening now is illegitimate and unfair.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao had argued as a senate proxy during last week’s meeting that the divestment resolution was directional, holding firm in his stance even after the Senate voted to uphold Sandhu’s decision to alter the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you are upset with what is happening, you now share our frustration with last week,” Dumlao said. “So, if you are sharing that frustration, let’s reflect on that and talk about that another time, but for right now, we are going to gather in our community and I suggest you guys [gather] in your community as well,” Dumlao said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83280\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83280\" data-attachment-id=\"83280\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/divestment-vote-cancelled-69th-senate-meeting-shut-down-by-civil-disobedience/img_3206/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3206\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83280 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83280\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Internal Vice President Jasmine Sandhu swore in the 13 senators initially present at the meeting. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Dumlao’s introduction, a young woman donning a bandana over her face stepped to the front. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am a Palestinian, and I have to hide my fucking face in front of all of you for the sake of my family,” she said, as Dumlao and a neighboring person rested their hands on her shoulders.

Pahl.</em></p></div>\n<p>Annie Wang is a second-year psychology major and member of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. Wang was last seen Friday morning around 4 a.m., according to Bryant Pahl, a third-year earth science major and Alpha Phi Omega Chapter president.</p>\n<p>A missing persons report was filed for Wang around 9:40 a.m. on Monday morning, according to Charlene Wu, one of Wang’s current housemates in Manzanita Village.</p>\n<p>“Her roommates last saw her at 3 a.m. studying in the dorms, but did not see her the next morning,” Pahl said. “The last message she sent [was] to her little in Alpha Phi Omega at 3:54 a.m.”</p>\n<p>Pahl said the location on her phone is currently off and said he believes her phone is “either dead or turned off.”</p>\n<p>Wang was last seen at an Alpha Phi Omega affiliated event during the fraternity’s general meeting on May 15, Pahl said. Alpha Phi Omega is a co-ed service-based fraternity.</p>\n<p>“She signed up for several service events during the weekend but did not attend any, which is a rare behavior for Annie as she is a very prominent servant leader. In fact, she currently has the most service hours in the fraternity,” Pahl said.</p>\n<p>Several people have posted notices about Wang’s disappearance on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page and other social media sites.</p>\n<p>Wang was later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-22/missing-ucsb-student-found-deceased-in-santa-ynez-mountains/\">found deceased</a> in the Santa Ynez Mountains, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Her friends set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/love-for-annie\">GoFundMe</a> on Wednesday to help her family with funeral expenses, according to the webpage.</p>\n<p><em>Updated: This article was updated to include information from SBSO.</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: This article was updated to include information about the GoFundMe.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Tank May 9 in the Corwin Pavilion, which had a similar format to that of the ABC television show, “Shark Tank.” The developers of the startups presented their projects in front of three judges, who were all experienced venture capitalists.</p>\n<p>The first TAMID Tank was held three years ago at Queens College in New York City by several TAMID chapters, according to Mordi Shadpour, a second-year philosophy and linguistics double major and president of the UCSB chapter of TAMID.</p>\n<p>Other TAMID chapters have since gone on to host TAMID Tanks as well, such as the chapters in USC and the University of Miami.</p>\n<p>“This kind of event gives students a chance to pitch in front of all of their friends and get access to actual investors, which is hard for students like us to get,” Shadpour said. “It also inspires other students to go out there and make something out of their own ideas.”</p>\n<p>Shadpour, along with other members of the UCSB TAMID chapter, began working on the logistics and funding of putting on TAMID Tank at UCSB during Fall Quarter 2017.</p>\n<p>They also began spreading word of the application process through several ways, such as informing the UCSB professional fraternities, associations and societies on campus, making pitches in Technology Management Program classes, sending out emails to various departments and paying for Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>From the initial 40 applications that TAMID received, about five to 10 were dropped early in the process due to them being either non serious or incomplete, according to Shadpour. The remaining applications were then scrutinized, with interviews of the applicants being conducted throughout winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>“We then passed all that info to the CEOs and co-founders of this company called Social Native. My brother is one of the CEOs and his partner was a judge at the USC chapter’s TAMID Tank, so we felt they could help us with this and they went ahead and chose the three for us. Obviously no names of the applicants were involved to bias the process,” Shadpour said.</p>\n<p>The three finalists included Garpie, an on-foot navigation service that allows users to easily and privately locate and meet with up with their friends in real time; Nectir, an education app that better facilitates classroom participation and study groups; and Crypto For Charity, a service that allows for direct donations of digital currencies to charities.</p>\n<p>At the end of the event, the three judges chose Garpie as the winner of the competition.</p>\n<p>“When we won, it kind of showed that it wasn’t just us thinking that this was a good idea, but also that the public really does like it as well,” said Isaac Golberg, a third-year financial mathematics and statistics major and the vice president of strategic development of Garpie.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83207\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83207\" data-attachment-id=\"83207\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83207\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83207\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The three judges chose Garpie as the winner of the competition. <em>Courtesy of Mordi Shadpour</em></p></div>\n<p>Golberg said that the win meant a lot to him, as he and the team behind the project put their “blood, sweat, and tears” into Garpie and have “become really one with the product.”</p>\n<p>“The feedback I got from after the event from people was just incredible. Having people come up to me and say things like, ‘This is exactly what I need,’ and, ‘I need this now,’ was incredible to hear,” Golberg said.</p>\n<p>Golberg said what he believed sold the judges on Garpie was the increased accuracy of the geolocation services that the application has, which allows users to precisely locate their friends even in large crowds or huge spaces.</p>\n<p>“Garpie is significantly more accurate than anything on the market right now,” Golberg said. “When you’re using Google Maps or any other big navigation service, they can have up to a 50-foot discrepancy. When it comes to Garpie, it has about a two-to-five-foot accuracy.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golberg said this increased accuracy also allows for the usage of an augmented reality feature within the app.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With Garpie, the augmented reality comes into play with the camera view,” Golberg said. “When you see your friend on a map and you try to go to them, once you start getting close to their location, you can turn on your camera view, as if you were taking a picture, and a virtual marker is displayed above the person’s head. This virtual marker can be an emoji or any virtual content that you want.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re in a crowded space like a music festival, that 50 foot discrepancy I mentioned earlier in other services doesn’t help you locate your friend with the virtual marker at all. You need that marker right above your friend’s head,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p>Golberg plans on using the $2,300 cash prize money on travel expenses incurred when meeting with investors in order to raise the seed money needed to get Garpie out into the market by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to accomplish something that nobody else has been able to do,” Golberg said. “The fact is that these major companies, like Apple, Google and Snapchat, would love to optimize their geolocation services … and they have the vast resources to do it, but they haven’t been able to figure out how to do it. So the fact that we have been able to get around this obstacle shows the appeal behind the product.”</p>\n<p>Golberg said that the app is currently in alpha testing while further refinements are made to Garpie, but said that beta testing will soon commence.</p>\n<p>“There will definitely be people on campus testing it,” Golberg said. “After [the beta] cycle we’ll move into our full launch.”</p>\n<p>Shadpour was pleased with the initial response and ultimate turnout to the event. He said several professional groups he approached were enthusiastic about TAMID and sent many of their members to the event.</p>\n<p>“I thought there would be about 330 people who would come, so we only put 330 seats out … There were a lot of people standing in the back. It looked like ultimately there was about 400 people who came throughout the night,” Shadpour said.</p>\n<p>Shadpour said that the event went “amazing” and the highlight of the night for him was just seeing all the people in the back “supporting the students and coming to check out TAMID.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83204\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83204\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/","id":2238,"author":{"id":75,"name":"Eric Moon"},"related":[2237,2236,2235],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student Falls Off I.V.
