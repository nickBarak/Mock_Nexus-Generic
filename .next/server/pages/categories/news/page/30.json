Valdenegro:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June 2017, the city of Philadelphia raised its rainbow flag high for its first annual Pride Kickoff. The pride flag fluttered in the Philadelphia air, championing the experiences of millions of TLGBQ+*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> members across the world. It harkened to the activism that got us here and to the activism to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the difference that this flag had as it marched through the streets of Philadelphia and through the many streets after that are the two stripes that adorned it on top. One black and one brown—an innocuous reminder that queerness is woven into more colors than just one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being here at UCSB has proven to me that I am those stripes. Let me explain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My college experience has pushed and pulled, expanded and contracted, championed and sequestered the many identities that constitute me. In some contexts, my brownness is celebrated. My native tongue expresses itself freely and without harassment. I can wear rainbow buttons happily and without danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in other contexts, as a lot of us have come to realize, we have to push aside who we are for an identity that is more immediate and palatable. We have to relegate our life experiences to just business or to whatever the sign on the door says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point, many of us have felt the sting from the relegation I’m talking about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re struggling to make ends meet that week, you probably don’t want to tell your professor. Why make it about you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re doing science, you’re not a woman; you’re a scientist. Why does it have to be about gender?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re an academic, you’re not a person of color; you’re an academic. Why do you have to make it about race?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re a non-traditional student, you’re just a student. Why are you different?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this kind of thinking is dangerous when we ignore the disparities and disadvantages that might exist in our settings. It is impossible to support one another if we do not understand the situations we exist in. I can’t save you from drowning if I refuse to acknowledge you’re underwater.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of that, being a person of color fighting behind the rainbow flag used to mean leaving our brownness at the door with the umbrellas. It meant fighting for a movement that never really promised to help those in the intersection of being a person of color and queer. (And don’t even get me started on how much more we need to advocate for trans people.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the wisdom that our queer brothers, sisters and non-binary siblings in Philadelphia reminded us of that June is the diverse nature of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That one descriptor does not fit all. We are not just gay. We are not just queer. Those words are just adjectives among a multiplicity of others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this Pride, go celebrate the diverse nature of being queer — heck, even the diverse nature of just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being human</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And even if you’re not queer, I invite you to turn to the person next to you and appreciate them for the depth of who they are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go fight for each other. Celebrate one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did that on purpose</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ángel A. Valdenegro is a graduating queer Latino physics major who wants you to google Kayden Clarke, Tamika Washington and Chynal Lindsey.</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>Being Invisibly Queer: by Kylie George</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who have been by my side throughout every one of my phases in college (*cough cough Nexites cough cough*), y’all know all about my various dick-scapades: From the Night of Three to fucking a random dude I met at a bus stop, my thirst for peen is never quenched.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibly the craziest thing I’ve ever done to date, however, is willingly enter into a healthy, committed relationship for the last year and some change. Shocker: This person has a penis. Therefore, my relationship will appear heterosexual to the average stranger for (hopefully) the rest of my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this staunch dedication to cock has caused some problems for me throughout my time at UCSB, if not from external sources then from my own internal thought processes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I constantly questioned — and sometimes still question — my validity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community because before sophomore year of college, I had never acted on any of my feelings toward various women in my life to whom I felt attracted. I felt like the only way for me to prove to both myself and others that my bisexuality was a valid self-descriptor was by experiencing reciprocal sex with a woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t even completely out until my sophomore year of college and, even still, I haven’t directly told my mom yet (if you’re reading this, Mom, hey hello hi, I’m bi!).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my entire first year of college, I thought that people in my dorm hall would be made uncomfortable with the fact that I’m attracted to girls, so I kept my identity on the down low. It didn’t help that I was ultra-paranoid about the way people perceived me and if they liked me or not because of my </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and I say this literally </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crippling anxiety. I was also affected by the perceived lack of a queer community on campus, so I thought being out would not be accepted by the majority of UCSB students or faculty, thus further encouraging me to beat down a large part of who I was and still am.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not until I joined a sorority (Tri Delta, R.I.P.) did I feel comfortable openly sharing my deep attraction to that güd pu$$. Sure, it helped that over the summer I saw a psychiatrist and got put on a pretty high dose of Prozac to help with my anxiety, but I truly feel that I began publicly identifying as queer because of the amazing queer women I met in Tri Delta.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m fully aware of how sratty this next sentence is going to sound, but hear me out: My Big really inspired me to embrace a large facet of my identity by sharing her own story and her various struggles that come with being gay. From bringing me down from a panic attack brought on by being pretty publicly sexually assaulted to opening my eyes to the awesome (and very present) LGBTQ+ community on campus, I owe this woman a lot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My journey to self-acceptance did not conclude at the beginning of sophomore year, though. I mean, what am I? Fucking Molly Ringwald in “The Breakfast Club”???? Good guess, but not quite. I still have to exist after the happily-ever-after.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incidentally, though, I ended up sleeping with a woman for the first time shortly after this life-changing epiphany, and it left me with a bag filled with mixed feelings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took her home from a frat party (wearing a huge sweatshirt, pajama bottoms and fuzzy socks with my Birks, no less), and the deed was done. The only problem was that afterward, I didn’t feel like I proved anything to anybody by doing it. The encounter felt just as empty as the billionth dick I sucked dry the week prior, and I ended up feeling like I had an even feebler claim to membership in the queer community than I did before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since that night, I have not slept with another woman, and at this point I may never get to. Don’t get me wrong; my current partner is more than I could ever ask for in a lifelong companion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess I’m still worried about how others perceive the image I put out into the world, which is dumb and I should stop that right now, but emotions don’t work that way. I want it to be apparent that I’m queer and not just lying about it to get attention, but I’m struggling with finding a way other than tattooing “QUEER” on my forehead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend was talking to me the other day about being bisexual in college, and she expressed a lot of frustration for the girls who identify as “bi-curious” because they give “real” bisexual women a bad image. I couldn’t help but think about the ease with which I could be grouped in with the former group, and I felt so invalidated. I’m not saying the friend was talking about me or even that I agree with their statement (which I very much don’t), but I realized in that moment that I still don’t feel deserving of the label “queer” or “bisexual.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m learning to embrace my identity and stand up when people comment on my “invisible queerness” brought on by my love for my heterosexual male partner, but I still have a long way to go to where I really feel like I can appropriately consider myself queer.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88923\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88923\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/","id":3259,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3258,3257,3256],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pay-What-You-Can Photography Event Inspires Other Students To Give Back","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-06-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was the desire to strike a good balance between paying artists for their art and making grad photos as accessible as possible that led Kiyomi Morrison to create the event.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henley Gate is synonymous with graduation photos.

But I have friends struggling for rent, struggling for tuition. I can’t imagine an added fee,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was the desire to strike a good balance between paying artists for their art and making grad photos as accessible as possible that led her to create the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison was initially going to stake out by Henley Gate alone, but then she decided to post on Facebook about her idea to get more photographers for the event. Once she had heard back from a handful of people, she set up a group chat for everyone to schedule themselves for shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Niko Van Eimeren, one of the photographers at the event, said she signed up to help because she personally understood the struggle graduating students face when paying for end-of-the-year expenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fourth-year environmental studies major, Van Eimeren said she herself wasn’t sure if she was going to get her graduation photos taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[For] a lot of my friends, I took their photos for them at a discounted rate ‘cause I know that it can be really expensive,” Van Eimeren said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alejandra Gularte, one of the students who attended the event to have her photos taken, said she appreciated the event’s impact on both graduating students and photographers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I found it was a way to help smaller photographers that maybe wanted to get practice. But also, for me, it’s cheaper, because I pay a lot of money for school,” Gularte said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison gives all the credit for the event to the photographers who signed up to help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This was only possible because people were volunteering their time to do their photos,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Photography isn’t always something you’d think would be something you could do to help people,” Morrison said.  “Anyone can really do something like this, stuff like this means a lot to people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted that as a graduating student, it can be difficult to see all of your friends posting their photos and not be able to afford them yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a good grad photo to give to their mom — it’s like a small thing in your day, but honestly would make someone’s day,” she said. “If you can, take time out of your personal life to do a nice thing once in a while.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year art major Reannah Viray took inspiration from that idea and put her own twist on it.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88921\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88921\" data-attachment-id=\"88921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/pay-what-you-can-photography-event-inspires-other-students-to-give-back/pay-what-you-can_sanya-kamidi_online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1246&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1246\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pay What You Can_Sanya Kamidi_ONLINE (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88921 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=888%2C553\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray hosted her own pay-what-you-can event for graduating seniors on Wednesday in the Arbor, offering her art services to anyone who wanted their cap decorated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a photographer in high school, so I wish that I could have participated, but I didn’t know how to until it was over, so I was like, ‘what other way can I spare my time to people who don’t have the resources or the income necessarily to get grad caps done?’” Viray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s nice to be able to offer something that could be seen as a luxury to people that can’t afford it.

So for [transfer students] to even be in this position [to graduate], especially people of color, it’s so monumental. It really takes a lot for us to get here and to even graduate from a four-year institution,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think a lot of us expect [to graduate].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for Hernandez, and for the numerous transfer students graduating with the class of 2019, the Transfer Student Graduation is an “acknowledge[ment] that we did beat the statistics and that we are here. You achieved this. You deserve it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the second year the Transfer Student Graduation has been held. Last year, the Transfer Student Graduation welcomed around 50 students; this year’s will see over 120, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current Transfer Student Graduation Committee is mainly led by fourth-years Neyra Patricio, Katherin Jordan, Sophie Weimer and Hernandez; the committee began planning for graduation during Winter Quarter, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s budget to hold the entire graduation was $200. This year’s is $2,000, an improvement Hernandez attributes to the Transfer Student Alliance’s transformation from an organization to an Associated Students Boards, Commission and Units (BCU). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Hernandez and Patricio, having a transfer student graduation is incredibly important in a number of ways, but particularly because of the unique and shared experiences that transfer students go through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because [the ceremony is] different. Most transfer students only have transfer friends, at least the people that I know, so getting to have a graduation ceremony with people that you know [is good], especially because a lot of transfers value it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all really nervous for it to get here, but we also want it to get here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, who was also involved in the planning of the Transfer Student Graduation during its first year, echoed Patricio’s sentiments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that being on Senate with the 69th Senate and working on the Transfer Student Alliance allowed him to see students “get rewarded for all the hard work they’ve done.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing it last year, how it impacted and how it meant so much to many students… There’s literally people crying [at the ceremony] and it was very emotional and very intense, but it was good,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Hernandez and Patricio hope the tradition of a transfer student graduation ceremony continues after they both leave UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope we built the tradition and it keeps on going,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s ceremony will be held on June 14 in Bren Courtyard at 5 p.m. There will also be a reception at 6:30 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lavender Graduation and Pride Awards:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lavender Graduation — a graduation ceremony dedicated toward UCSB students who identify as members of the LGBTQIA+ community — has been running for 19 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony, alongside the Pride Awards, has served as an “integral part” of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), according to UCSB alumnus ‘18 and RCSGD Programming Coordinator Dwayne Mosbey, who helped plan this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Lavender Graduation] began to create a space for queer and trans students, especially when they were entering spaces they didn’t necessarily feel comfortable in or within an insitution they didn’t feel was serving them,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The planning of this year’s ceremony was a “collaborative effort” between Mosbey, RCSGD Director Craig Leets and Associative Director Quinn Solis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey explained that in previous years, the Pride Awards used to be separate; this year, they were “rolled together” because both are “made to recognize queer and trans students’ resilience and academic achievement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We thought it’d be great for those two to be coupled together,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduation ceremony itself is modeled similarly to the typical UCSB graduation, Mosbey said. The ceremony will see graduates “walk” into the Student Resource Building forum, following a welcome ceremony with a number of speakers, which typically includes the vice chancellor, a keynote speaker and a student speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said there are typically 30 to 35 people who partake in the ceremony; this year saw an uptick, rounding out to 45 students. Last year, Mosbey himself was one of the people who walked in the Lavender Graduation ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows the chance for queer and trans students to be recognized outside of the larger ceremony, and [anyone] can come to the Lavender Graduation. [They can express] their most gender expression and gender identity and feel comfortable with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can wear whatever they want and can also decorate their gowns and caps — “This is all about making sure [queer and trans students] feel comfortable and that they feel recognized.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All graduates who go through the Lavender Graduation ceremony are awarded purple cords, while folks who work at the RCSGD and people who win awards receive rainbow tassels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of awards also varies, depending on the number of nominations. This year, 13 awards will be handed out, according to Mosbey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey hopes students who go through the ceremony will take away one key thing: “We’re allowing that space for them to feel supported, [so they] know that throughout their college career, the queer and trans community was here for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And that we will continue to be here for them even after they graduate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s Lavender Graduation will happen on June 9 between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. in the Student Resource Building forum. </span></p>\n<p><b>Black Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony Bolden, a fourth-year biopsychology major and the undergraduate speaker for this year’s Black Graduation, said he almost turned down the opportunity to speak at this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was kind of hesitant, just because </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do have pretty good experience with public speaking, but I didn’t feel like I wanted to add that [burden] on for myself,” he said. “But then [the offer] gave me a little bit of moment of clarity, because I got a chance to look back and see how far I’ve really come.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of realized that it was a little bit humbling,” Bolden added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden is one of the 55 Black undergraduate and graduate students who will be participating in this year’s Black Graduation ceremony on Saturday, June 15 at noon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Stallworth, co-chair of the organizing committee and second-year sociology and Black studies double major, said it’s important for Black students to have a space where they can come together and celebrate their achievements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The educational system wasn’t really built for people of color in general, but for Black students, we really had to fight for us to have our identity be present on campus,” Stallworth said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony is a way for Black students to do just that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth said the ceremony will have a mix of student speakers as well as spoken word, musical performances and slideshows of the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Jeffrey Stewart, from UCSB’s Department of Black Studies, and Professor R. L’Heureux Lewis-McCoy from New York University’s Department of Applied Statistics, Social Science and Humanities, are the two faculty speakers. Meridith Merchant, a psychologist from Counseling and Psychological Services, is the closing speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth believes the speakers’ words will leave an impression on the graduating students and is looking forward to hearing from them all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The speech is] sending a message and it’s setting the tone for someone’s life,” he said. “I think it’s just really important to have speakers that really motivate and empower students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth is also happy to see the graduates — many of whom have helped him in his two years at UCSB — step off the stage and onto a new chapter after college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I’m] also just excited to see all the Black grads and be able to celebrate them because I think it’s amazing how they’ve been really mentors for me throughout my time here at UCSB. I get to see them go off, and I get to follow in their footsteps.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden echoed Stallworth’s words, naming several other students who will be graduating alongside him  as inspirations over the past few years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to talking about the achievements of the Black community at UCSB over the past few years, Bolden said he wants to highlight the growth of individual students like Zenzile Riddick and Kuvimbanashe “Eddie” Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This class of Black grads is phenomenal. One of my hallmates, she’s going to freakin’ Harvard, that’s amazing, Zenzile. Since first year, I knew she was going to be amazing,” Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said he’s proud to have seen everyone’s growth over the past four years and where they’re all headed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m proud to be part of the 5% that has come through here. I definitely recognize that a lot of people don’t have such a positive outlook of UCSB like I have, not everyone’s been blessed with the great experience that I’ve had here,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[But] after coming here, I think that my pride in being a Black man has done nothing but grown exponentially, because I feel like I’m representing my own people here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A special part of the ceremony for Bolden is the fact that a large portion of the Black graduates participating in the ceremony lived together in the Black Scholars Hall in Santa Rosa during their first year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to be around each other and enjoy each other’s presence and see each other’s faces and see us finish through,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At typical graduation ceremonies, it’s easy for Black students to feel like less of a community, Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing us spread so thin isn’t the same, isn’t nearly as powerful for us being together, having our own space, our own ceremony, our own opportunity to recognize one another.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said his speech at the Black Graduation ceremony will be one of the first times his family will see him in an academic setting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now this is an opportunity for me to show [my mom] what I’ve been doing this whole time.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Chicanx/Latinx Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chicanx/Latinx Graduation ceremony is just as much about the community behind students as it is about the graduating students themselves, two of the organizers said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesenia Cardenas, a fifth-year chemistry major, and Jessica Arenas, a fourth-year global studies major, agreed their favorite part of the ceremony is when the students walk into Harder Stadium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students are asked to bring two people to walk them in as live mariachi music plays in the background and photographers snap photos of them, the two said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students, they feel like they get their degree for family too, so it’s nice that you can walk up there, it’s almost like they’re walking up there with you,” Cardenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas sit on an 11-member organizing committee that begins its work one full year before graduation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s cabinet, which organized the 45th Chicanx/Latinx Graduation being held on Saturday, June 15, 2019 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., was dedicated to giving more voice to graduating students throughout the whole process, Cardenas and Arenas both said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year we’ve been focusing a lot on being inclusive of Central American identities because that’s a prominent issue, the erasure of Central Americans,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB is recognized as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, Arenas said it can be hard to actually feel that they are supported or represented on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a first-generation student, it’s hard to navigate higher education, and sometimes you don’t see people that look like you, in your classroom settings or even in your living settings sometimes,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like most students enjoy the Chicanx/Latinx Graduation because it celebrates their identity and also their cultural background. They aren’t represented in classrooms, but they do feel represented in the graduation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to infusing the ceremony with various cultural elements, the committee works to ensure that the ceremony caters to family members who attend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ceremony, held in Harder Stadium, will have over 500 students walking the stage. A lot of those students are first-generation and have parents who don’t speak English, Cardenas said, so they will have a translator present so their parents can follow along as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From my personal experience, my parents don’t really know what I do here, they just know that I go to school and I’m studying,” Arenas laughed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas said that while friends and family back home might not understand what they’re studying, they’re still very proud of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d rather them understand the ceremony than just sitting there and see all these names called out. At least with [Chicanx/Latinx Graduation] there’s performances and Spanish,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><b>Undocumented Student Services:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monarch butterfly, adorning a pin which many undocumented graduating students will be wearing as they walk the stage, is a symbol of migration, Undocumented Student Services Coordinator Diana Valdivia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To wear this pin is to recognize the impact migration has had in your life experiences. This pin is a small token of your resiliency and accomplishments,” a small note accompanying the pin reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undocumented Student Services began to distribute the pins to graduating undocumented students last year, Valdivia said. The pins are meant to recognize both undocumented students and others who participate in the services’ programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At its year-end ceremony, the service recognizes different student leaders for their work and advocacy in the undocumented student community on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Valdivia said they had approximately 30 students graduating, compared to around 25 last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s good to know for [undocumented students] that they’re graduating, that they’re not the only one that is graduating that has been through this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the service also handed out separate pins for students to give to their loved ones and supporters, one of which reads “Proud Immigrant Dad of a Graduating Senior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We recognize that students get pins, get stoles and then we also know that it took a community effort to have folks graduate,” Valdivia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Valdivia said they hope to find a way to recognize students who may not be undocumented themselves but have family members or loved ones who are. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

transitioning into having full voting power during his second year. </span><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil will join the current regent designate, UC San Diego doctoral student Hayley Weddle, in serving on the Regents board if he is approved at the July meeting. He will serve alongside Weddle when she succeeds the current student regent, UC Los Angeles doctoral student Devon Graves, for this upcoming year; following Weddle’s term, Muwwakkil will take over and serve as the voting regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents is comprised of</span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/about/members-and-advisors/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 26 appointed and ex-officio members </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that govern the UC system. The UC student regent is a full-voting regent of the University of California and the only voting member on the board who is required to be a student at one of the UC campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only real differences [between student regents and other appointed regents] is that they are closer to the student population, both in age and geographic proximity. The idea is that they might be able to leverage the student voice and kind of contextualize the policy decisions that are being made,” Muwwakkil said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil will spend the first year of his two-year term learning the ropes of the position before transitioning into having full voting power during his second year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first year, you’re participating in all of the committee meetings and going to all of the talks, but you’re not voting — you’re functionally shadowing the student regent who’s appointed in their second year of the position,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A record 113 UC students applied for the position of the 2020-21 student regent, </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-student-regent-nominated-2019-20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compared to 40 who applied in the cycle before</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Muwwakkil attributes this to the previous student regents’ efforts to publicize the position and inform students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Regent Graves and Regent Weddle made a point to visit all of the campuses and to market the position space… and encouraging a lot of folks who would not have applied otherwise to engage in the process,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a member of the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA) at UCSB and a first-generation transfer student, Muwwakkil said he took notice of the lack of representation of students of color, and more specifically, nontraditional students of color, in student governance and higher education in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the ways Muwwakkill addressed this issue was by helping to revive UCSB’s BGSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Myself and a lot of other graduate students of color found that our numbers are quite low. We decided to… revitalize the existing infrastructure of the Black Graduate Student Association of UCSB,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil worked with David Stamps, a doctoral student in the Department of Communications, to reestablish the BGSA, and eventually served as the second BGSA president during the 2017-18 academic year. During this time, he began to look for more avenues to expand his advocacy work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, he reasoned the best way to make an impact while fulfilling his academic commitments was by serving as student regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil initially applied for the position during the last application cycle but was passed over for Weddle. He will now be shadowing her as regent designate next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil said Weddle focuses on advocating for the “basic rights of students” like “food insecurity, housing security, accessibility” as well as on other issues like Title IX regulations and sexual violence on college campuses.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Weddle’s platform, Muwwakkil plans to bring attention to the challenges faced by nontraditional students.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we engage with leadership from each campus, we also have to be intentional to engage with students whose perspectives may very well not be represented by their leadership,” Muwwakkil said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Society does] this thing where we kind of focus in on like the 18-year-old, [and say] ‘Be stellar at 18 or no UC for you.’ I think this is a problem because there’s a lot of living that people do between the age of 18 and retirement. We need to validate the experiences of non-traditional students … within the classroom,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer student from Los Angeles City College, Muwwakkil said his experience has shaped his views about accessibility for nontraditional students navigating higher education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re [a] first-generation student going through college, there’s a lot of guesswork that happens … You’re confused about the process, what it means to apply,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As regent designate, Muwwakkil said he first hopes to educate himself on the operations and inner workings of the Board of Regents and maneuvering the system, as well as pressing issues within the system and how these relate to students and their success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m going to be doing a lot of fact finding and understanding what are the actual mechanisms by which things are done and accomplished; what are the prominent issues facing the UC and how the students build on their local campus level and the larger system,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his tenure as student regent, Muwwakkil said he hopes to further the UC system’s aim in cultivating an environment that is conducive to the success of all students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Are there ways that all of these different types of students can engage in the huge bureaucracy that is the university? If that’s true for some and not for others, then we have some work to do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

But with the help of perfect timing and a movie that changed her mind, Xu decided to open her wallet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a Korean movie about policemen who watch drug dealers from a fried chicken place across the street. The fried chicken place was about to close down, so they bought the place to watch the drug dealers,” Xu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three days later, Xu offered to purchase Sweet Alley from Sun on a whim, who had been struggling to find a new owner for months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw [Sun’s] advertisement, and then the next day, I asked him if [Sweet Alley] is still on the market. He said, ‘Yes.’ And then the next day, I gave him the deposit.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With renovations set to begin next month, Xu wants to welcome customers with a completely new interior. On top of selling the frozen yogurt equipment, she plans to tear down old walls and refurnish the entire store; she is also flirting with obtaining a light liquor license. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The internal wall will be knocked down and moved further back, and I’ll add a small countertop so this whole area can be a sitting area,” she said, pointing to the concrete slab where customers used to walk up to get their frozen yogurt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TVs and dessert are also on Xu’s short list of amenities to include at her Vons, on top of the boba she plans to bring daily from Phresh Teas, a restaurant of hers dedicated to serving a variety of different tea creations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the unit’s small footprint, Xu estimates she will need roughly half the amount of employees she has staffed at her other restaurants. Instead of hiring former Sweet Alley employees, Xu said she will be “pick[ing] from Uniboil staff” and offering them a spot at the new store. Xu expects Vons will be managed by the wife of the current Uniboil head chef.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure authenticity, Xu said Vons flies trainers directly from South Korea to host trainings for employees whenever a new store opens — a franchise policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Uniboil, which follows a more traditional restaurant style, Xu plans to make Vons more expedient so customers can just “grab and go.” If a customer simply wants to buy food and leave, Xu estimates they can be on their way in as little as 10 minutes. If customers would like to stay and eat, however, they’ll have plenty of time to choose when to come in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, I’m thinking Monday through Thursday, we’ll do 3 o’clock to 11 o’clock and 3 o’clock to two in the morning Friday through Sunday,” Xu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If fried chicken isn’t enough to fill customers’s stomachs, Xu said desserts will be available as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll be selling boba cake — a milk tea cake with boba on it — and also coconut jellos, which is made of coconut juice and real coconut with jello inside. We’ll also be selling Hong-Kong style desserts and street food,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further impress palates, Xu said she is working with a local chef who is skilled in making authentic “Chinese street snacks.” She said the chef currently works from home and only delivers food from his house. If everything goes according to plan, Xu said, those street snacks may soon be on Vons’ menu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xu also plans on developing a “really strong delivery system.” Not only will this allow Vons to serve food beyond its own walls, but it will also help the store remain competitive, as most restaurants in I.V. offer some form of delivery service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she has a lot of work ahead of her in the coming months, Xu said she is looking forward to the day she can flip the “closed” sign outside the store, which will be sometime in the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once complete, Xu said Vons will be the sole restaurant in I.V. where customers can sink their teeth into Korean-fried “flats” and “drums” — the industry-standard cuts of chicken that are commonly fried into delicacies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no good fried chicken around here. We only have KFC — not even a Popeyes or Wingstop. We don’t have anything.

About 92% of the building’s total space will be devoted to classrooms and lecture halls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Finance and Capital Strategies Committee is comprised of UC Regents as well as other advisory members, including Governor Gavin Newsom, UC President Janet Napolitano and chancellors from some of the UC campuses. They approved UCSB’s new building </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> along with new building projects at the Riverside, Berkeley and San Diego campuses </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 16 at the UC Regents meeting at UC San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new building projects are part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UC’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>; the plan was implemented by the Regents in 2010, with the purpose of “shap[ing] how the campus will develop to the year 2025, including changes in our academic programs and the development of additional campus housing for students, faculty, and staff,” according to UCSB’s Design, Facilities, and Safety Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, UCSB’s new Classroom Building will cost $97,133,000; 82% of funding is from state appropriations of $79,787,000, while 18% is from campus funds, which are non-state, non-tuition reserves from grants, investments and sponsored contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A portion of state appropriations will also come from state funding previously allocated for the Campbell Hall Replacement Building. Originally, the funding was allocated to tear down and replace Campbell Hall; however, concerns of the project’s financial feasibility, combined with immediate safety concerns, led UCSB to implement critical life-safety improvements and repairs in order to ensure safe, ongoing use of Campbell Hall, according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal states the new building will also alleviate problems of over-enrollment which have contributed to lower four-year graduation rates. UCSB’s registrar cited “lack of classrooms and inappropriately sized classrooms as the primary cause of … increasing student waitlists that tend to affect the four-year graduation rate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new Classroom Building will accommodate more than “twice the capacity and many more rooms than the previous Campbell Hall plans,” according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other alternatives to the Classroom Building discussed in the proposal include leasing off-campus space or annexing existing academic and administrative building space, but these ideas were not deemed viable by the committee because all other existing facilities on campus are already fully occupied, and “logistical problems” prevented leasing buildings in Isla Vista for classroom use.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88801\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88801\" data-attachment-id=\"88801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/regents-approve-new-classroom-building-to-alleviate-over-enrollment/screen-shot-2019-05-29-at-3-32-34-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=1200%2C772&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,772\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-29 at 3.32.34 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=888%2C571&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88801 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=888%2C571\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=1024%2C659&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Proposed design for the new Classroom Building, located between the Psychology building and Davidson Library. <em>Courtesy of UC Regents</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to substantially increasing the amount of classroom space on campus, the Classroom Building will also incorporate more modern classroom designs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current classrooms are “exclusively traditional in format … lack[ing] the flexibility, amenities, and technology needed to accommodate contemporary, project-based learning,” according to the proposal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three active learning classrooms in the Classroom Building are designed for project-based teaching and group and student participation, with flexibility to arrange furniture and digital and visual technology for each class’s specific needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional discussion classrooms will include moveable furnishings and digital capability for project-based work, and lecture halls will be designed with rotating seats, allowing “turn-to-team” interaction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Classroom Building plan also requires the demolishing of Building 408, which holds the </span>McCauley Lab in EEMB (Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology) and the Passow Lab in MSI (Marine Science Institute), along with various graduate and faculty offices.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus bike path runs through the future construction site for the Classroom Building;

The new space is 981 square feet and has two offices and a bathroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center currently has approximately 550 square feet and is composed of one small room and an office. But this current space is not large enough to accommodate to students in need of private meeting spaces, according to Coby Dillard, veterans and military services coordinator.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard said an ideal “one-stop shop” resource center would have an academic advisor, a counselor and a certifying official who can double as a financial aid representative and provide any other resources that an incoming veteran student would need, all in one place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Dillard said, when a student comes to the center, he can “help to a degree,” but at the end of the day, he often has to direct them to multiple different places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Research says that if you have individuals who can come into a single location and get all their assistance, over the long-term, they perform better academically,” Dillard added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new location takes a step toward a “one-stop shop” with larger square footage and dedicated meeting rooms, which Dillard can use to set up office hours for various advisors to drop in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Dillard isn’t the first one who has tried to turn the center into a “one-stop shop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, two student veterans presented a list of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/veterans-fight-for-more-resources-at-ucsb/\">grievances and demands</a> for change to Chancellor Henry T. Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First on the list of demands was a “space that can continuously accommodate quiet study, lounge, peer to peer tutoring, mental health and VA counseling…. These rooms will not be decentralized and will share a similar location or structure.” But Dillard described this demand as only partially fulfilled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, the center occupied a 10-by-10 foot space in building 477, across the courtyard from the current office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of the demands, roughly 400 members of the entire student body were military-related, which includes veterans, military dependents, reserve duty students and more. Dillard said that number has now increased to over 520. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the one-stop shop model is years in the making, the center’s high staff turnover made it difficult for any real progress to be made, according to Dillard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard is the fourth person since 2012 to run the program. The first two coordinators stepped down to go back to school, and the third served as an interim coordinator until Dillard was hired in July 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff turnover is also the reason why so many of the unspoken agreements that the center has with other departments on campus are not formal policies, Dillard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Institutionally, a lot of our policies exist, but they’re not formalized anywhere,” Dillard said. “I know all the veterans get priority registration… And then the question in here is ‘Is there a formal written policy?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of my relationships with other offices across campus are based on understandings that have worked, not necessarily formal policy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Dillard came to UCSB, his goal for his first year was “just stabilizing the place.” From there, Dillard said he moved on to assessing which areas of the center were in need of the most attention, and how he could best go about fixing them next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In September 2018, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked UCSB as the number four public school in the nation for veterans and 10th nationwide </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but Dillard finds that “rankings like that don’t necessarily reflect what the student experience is because that particular ranking did not ask any questions about the student experience.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, Dillard finds that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s survey, “Best for Vets” is a better metric as it accounts for “services and student experience.” Next year, Dillard plans to have veteran students at UCSB complete the survey so the university can be ranked on the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> survey.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard’s ideas for the center stem from years of experience of working with veterans, most recently in Virginia Beach, Va. Dillard said that coming to UCSB and working as a coordinator was the next progression for his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After doing this for seven, eight years, this is kind of the next progression for me career-wise,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next natural step is to run a program and if you’re going to run a program, [UCSB’s program] wouldn’t be bad to start with [because it is] one that is in need of some sort of strengthening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For his first Memorial Day at UCSB, Dillard wanted to not only honor former and current service members, but also make the holiday more visible to the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the Veterans and Military Services program installed a “flag garden” made up of 2,000 flags planted in the open green space between the Annex and Storke Lawn.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think everyone either appreciated it being there, or once they were told why it was there, then they appreciated it being there,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events like this are one way for Dillard and the program to increase visibility and awareness of veteran students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Dillard has several aspirations for the center in the next few years, the most significant one is emphasizing the importance of developing the Veterans and Military Services program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one actually has been here long enough to take it from a resource center to a program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard hopes to be the one to change this.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 30, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

UC Police Department officer Jonathan Lee Reyes. In the suit, Reyes alleges he was retaliated against for reporting misconduct in the department relating to the retention and promotion of an unqualified police trainee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Reyes’ whistleblowing led UCPD Lieutenant David Millard and UCPD Sergeant Gregory Smorodinsky to block Reyes from receiving a promotion to higher positions and that the two gave Reyes an unfair poor performance review.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an individual within UCPD who asked that their name not be used, Millard is currently at a training course at the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy; the individual provided photographic evidence to the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Millard was there and not on the UC Santa Barbara campus as of May 9. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was unable to comment on whether or not Millard was at the FBI academy, but could confirm that he is still an active member of the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that UCPD “retaliated against other employees based on the same protected class [as Reyes].” The suit also alleges that UCPD failed to  “discipline other employees outside [Reyes’] own protected class as severely” for the same actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes’ lawsuit is the latest of four lawsuits filed against the department since late last year, all of which allege that the plaintiffs were retaliated against for blowing the whistle on misconduct in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other three suits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v.

UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the complaint alleges that Millard repeatedly promoted a trainee officer from lower positions despite opposition from Reyes and others in the department who were concerned about the trainee’s performance. Reyes alleges he brought concerns forward to Millard multiple times, including when the trainee was first assigned to Reyes and later when Millard announced the trainee had completed Field Training Officer (FTO) training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case alleges that Millard’s approval to promote the unqualified trainee created “a threat to the safety of the public and the University” and violated <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=832\">California Penal Code 832</a>, which states that “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">peace officer shall satisfactorily complete an introductory training course.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in court documents begin in June 2017, when Reyes was assigned as an FTO with the trainee. Court documents say that after Millard announced in an email that the trainee will advance to the next phase, Reyes, along with several other officers, objected the promotion, pointing to “multiple evaluations by FTO’s [which] indicated that the trainee was failing,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite an FTO’s recommendation for the trainee’s termination and the trainee’s failure to pass a program from the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (P.O.S.T.) — the body responsible for creating law enforcement training requirements — Lieutenant Millard “successfully released [the trainee] from FTO training,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes then allegedly emailed the region coordinator for P.O.S.T. to relay his concerns about the failing trainee. Millard later met with Reyes and accused him of “not following an order” to promote the trainee, court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2017, Reyes was denied a promotion to corporal, despite being “better qualified for the position than other candidates selected for the position,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in September 2017, Reyes applied for a position as a sergeant but was again denied the promotion in March 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes alleges that he did not receive these positions, despite his qualifications, due to retaliation from Millard regarding the trainee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit also alleges that Reyes’ poor performance review from 2018 was another result of the department’s retaliation, this time from Smorodinsky “under the direction of [Millard].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents state “the review was very critical” and omitted “various positive things throughout the year.” Reyes submitted a grievance to the department “which detailed each point in his review that he felt was inaccurate or unwarranted,” and his review was later overturned in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in the suit involve a handful of other officers as well, including former Police Chief Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief Cathy Farley, Sergeant Gregory Pierce and Sergeant Rory Sheehey, who are named in the other cases as well. However, none of the aforementioned officers are being sued in Reyes’ case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three of the four cases filed since November 2018, including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are represented by the same law firm, Richie Litigation, based in Los Angeles. Antonio Castillo, a lawyer handling the cases from Richie Litigation, said in an email that the three cases “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are exposing long-term systemic systems of bullying and the suppression of the advancement of minority police officers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryan Smith, the plaintiff in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v. UC Regents, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the only officer of the five who worked with a different attorney, Peter Horton, to file his claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits brought forward by Reyes, Signa and the Littles are steps toward addressing the department’s alleged misconduct, according to Castillo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That these brave officers have come forward and inspired many more to do so means that we finally have an opportunity to make real progress in changing how the UCSB Police Department operates,” Castillo said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

a payroll system meant to streamline the way payroll functions, was implemented on UCSB and other UC campuses throughout the course of 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program’s website promises “Efficient, accurate payroll” — but since UC Path’s implementation, students across the UC have complained about delayed, missed or wrong pay, causing tension between the administration and students at the UC’s perceived inaction in fixing UCPath issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For most employers, not paying workers on time is a form of wage theft — but the University of California is currently exempt from the state’s strict wage theft laws,” a press release sent out by United Auto Workers Union (UAW) on Friday stated. UAW </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-05/union-workers-protest-ucpath-implementation-payment-issues/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held a rally in March 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to protest the implementation of UCPath. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW President Kavitha Iyengar said in the press release that the union is “encouraged” and “looking forward” to seeing the bill move onto the Assembly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because there is no penalty for this, UC chose to use its own workers as an interest-free bank as they worked out the system’s glitches. Without accountability measures in place, we have no doubt that UC will continue to take advantage of workers who have no legal recourse,” Iyengar said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2019, the UC Office of the President </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">took its first steps towards addressing the issue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of missed payments, offering varying amounts of money to approximately 750 workers who had been affected by UC Path. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill 698, co-authored by Senator Connie Leyva and Senator Scott Wiener, takes a step beyond the offered compensation and would make it a requirement for the UC system to pay its workers on time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California law requires that employees be paid twice a month on designated “regular pay days”; workers classified as executive, administrative or professional employees can be paid once a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed through the California State Assembly and signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would require that university employees who are paid on a monthly basis be paid “no later than 5 days after the close of the monthly payroll period.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the bill would require the university to create payroll regulations for employees who are paid on a “more frequent basis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating current California payment law results in a misdemeanor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC doesn’t pay workers “on time and on a regular payday,” employees can file a claim in state court or with the Labor Commissioner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC Path serves UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC Merced, UC Riverside, UCOP and UCSB.

id=\"caption-attachment-88036\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grange (pictured above at the opening of the Edible Garden Project) will be serving on the board until November 2020. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange, an environmental studies major, will be joining Carlos Lopez, Pegeen Soutar and Sarah Bernard on the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) Board of Directors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange’s term will span from May 2019 to November 2020, filling in for the remainder of former Director Lebell’s term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He filled one of two open seats on the board; the second spot is up for grabs following Director Celine Washington’s decision to leave the board, announced by Lopez during the same meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the meeting, Bernard said she has confidence in Grange’s capability, especially with the projects he can bring to the board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I see a lot of potential with Whit, with a lot of projects that include the community garden, including all different types of groups from the community,” Bernard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange first learned about the opening through his work developing the </span><a href=\"http://www.islavistamethodist.com/edible-garden-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community garden</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the University United Methodist Church on the corner of Camino del Sur and Sueño Road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange said his previous work in I.V. has familiarized himself with the area and invested in him a significance for I.V. parks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of college students don’t really see I.V. as much of a community at all, but the parks are a space where people can come together and neighbors can meet each other,” Grange said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a new director, Grange said he wants to focus on local community-based projects. Grange said community gardens, local government and being a part of the community are what he enjoys.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange hopes to learn more about the process of achieving projects in the community and “seeing how that project culminates and how funding is pulled together and how staff works with board members, works with the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone has an idea for a project in their community or if someone has some sort of vision they want to accomplish, the process for something like that, start to finish, is really cool,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just how all these different things come together because there’s so many parts in play, it’s almost mind boggling.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange plans to work on several projects, including the expansion of Estero Gardens and the development of the new community center set to open in August.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Grange hopes to see more students come out and interact with some of the more permanent residents in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most students view I.V. as a transitory place. Something you hear a lot with graduating people is like, ‘Oh yeah I’m over I.V.’ or whatever. People just have a certain idea over what the culture is in I.V. and don’t really try to explore beyond that,” Grange said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be cool to see people just meeting more of their neighbors and walking around with their headphones in less often.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Much of the night, however, was filled with silence as they mourned their friend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students wrote on a large sheet of paper placed on a table next to a picture of Wang, sharing their favorite memories and expressing how much they missed her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side of the table were flowers and cookies. Wang’s mother wanted cookies there to symbolize how much her daughter loved to bake, Pahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that Wang was so good at baking that her mother eventually stopped ordering from caterers and just let her daughter bake for her events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students who did speak about Wang shared what a positive person she was. For one student, Wang’s enthusiasm was the most contagious thing he said he had ever experienced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another of Wang’s friends, who is a photographer, remembered that she used to ask why he always wanted to take pictures of her when they were at an event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wherever she was, “she made it that much more fun,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pahl said it was hard to talk about Wang but said she was a “great person who I made a lot of memories with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two would spend countless hours talking about anything and everything after general meetings at the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity, Pahl said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most amazing thing about Annie is that she was very well spoken and very articulate about what she said,” Pahl said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pahl said one night he went to drop off Wang, but the two found themselves talking through the night instead. While the two were chatting, Pahl accidentally left the emergency lights on his car on. By the time he went to his car, the battery was dead. While he waited for help, Wang was there to keep him company, talking with him for nearly another hour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other friends shared stories of Wang always putting others before herself and being there for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Roy, a fourth-year student at UCSB, also recalled one of her favorite memories of Wang. The two met because Wang would study at San Rafael Residence Hall, where Roy lived, even though Wang was a resident of Manzanita Village. Because of this, Wang would routinely lock herself out late at night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roy said she would usually be up late as well and would always let Wang back in the hall. Roy once asked Wang why she would always go out late at night, despite knowing she had no way back in the dorm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best time to see a shooting star is to go outside at midnight and look straight up at the sky,” Wang responded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night, Roy took Wang’s advice. Though it took a few days, she finally saw her first shooting star.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, Annie was a light,” Roy said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

We do have a large community, and hopefully that moves at least one person to stay in college. We would have another queer person of color being able to graduate college, when statistically speaking, it is already hard to get in here, and even harder to [graduate],” said Ricardo Uribe, a former Letters and Science senator with the 69th Senate.</p>\n<p>Photos of the event captured by <em>Nexus</em> photographers can be viewed below:</p>\n<p></p><p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-88624-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-10.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88615\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-10.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88614\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-9.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88620\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-2.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88622\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-4.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1203\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88621\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-3.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-12.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88617\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-12.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-11.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88616\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-11.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88613\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-8.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88612\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-7.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88611\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Each bench had a photo of the victim as well as a short paragraph about them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd entered Anisq’oyo Park, Kira Weiss, Ph.D. ethnomusicology student at UCSB, played several songs on the cello to welcome them in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once everyone was settled in, Weiss played a theme composed by Heena Yoon, Ph.D. candidate in music, three times in a row, and asked the audience to hum along. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The theme, called “Hope in the Labyrinth,” has been played every year since 2014, Weiss said, but this is the first time she has been able to play it at the annual vigil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The indication for how to play [the theme] is slowly, in grief, but then it’s also supposed to be hopeful too and I think [Yoon’s] idea with everybody humming together is like trying to find connection and find the strength of our voices together,” Weiss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer and Collins Puente spoke once again after the cello music and thanked the audience for attending before introducing the first speaker of the evening, Chancellor Henry T. Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a heartfelt turnout from our students, our staff and our colleagues, professors and our community members,” Yang began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are all coming together as a community to honor and remember one of the campus’s most difficult moments. Five years ago, our university faced an unthinkable tragedy. We suffered the tragic loss of six of our own and saw pain inflicted on nine injured. When one hurts, we all hurt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang went on to name each of the victims and talked about the hopes, dreams and ambitions they carried. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each of these six students were shining stars, beaming with the same brilliance and warmth like the candles among us,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We suffered the tragic loss of six of our own and saw pain inflicted on nine injured. When one hurts, we all hurt.” </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next speaker, UCPD Officer Ariel Bournes, touched upon his own experience as a first responder that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes, who studied art at UCSB, worked as a community service officer (CSO) when he attended UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes later worked on community outreach for the UCSB police department for several years. But at the end of the day, he found that many of the conversations he had with students and community members ended with them expressing frustration that other police officers didn’t feel the same way as he did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of the conversations ended something like this: ‘Hey Ariel, that was awesome that you came out, and you listened, and you conversed with us. But here’s the thing: you’re not even a police officer!’” Bournes said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After I heard that speech one too many times, I decided, ‘I’m gonna become a police officer.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a goofy kid who “regularly walked around with paint splattered on [his] clothing from various art projects [he] was working on,” Bournes said even his own mother didn’t think he could become a police officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he faced the same sentiment from several other police officers in the department, there was one officer who Bournes said gave him a chance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of them said, ‘Okay, you should come on a ride-along with me.’ So we looked at our schedules, we worked it out and we circled the date.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes paused for a long time, as audience members began to put the story together in their heads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he finally spoke again, his voice cracked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“May 23, 2014.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Less than 30 minutes into my first police ride-along, the shooting started. I got a front row seat to things that no one should ever have to see. And here I stand, five years later, now an officer myself, thinking back to that moment, and thinking back to the hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of moments that we all shared as a community in the aftermath.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the one thing Bournes wanted attendees to remember was how the community responded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We used art and protest and therapy and faith and food and tears and research and collaboration and passion and planning in order to heal and to protect and to overcome. It was exemplary. It was astonishing. And it was, and it is, an honor and a privilege to be counted as even a small piece of this community. Isla Vista, you are the template.

Klawunn, who arrived on campus in Fall Quarter 2015, spoke about how even though she wasn’t here when the community suffered the tragedy, she was able to see how it came together in the months and years afterward to become stronger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have learned so much about [the victims’] legacies through the values of community here,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I love the features of our everyday lives that arise from the love and strength that members of this community found in themselves in 2014, like the cranes in the Student Resource Building, the lights in the tunnel that we walked through tonight and in the Love and Remembrance Garden,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The parents of Christopher Michaels-Martinez, Katie Cooper and George Chen all spoke at the memorial event as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Martinez, Christopher Michaels-Martinez’s father, read a poem by Courtney Martin titled “A Responsibility to Light.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The poem urged listeners to feel their emotions strongly, even the difficult ones, and to use those feelings to drive them to create art of any kind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan Cooper, Katie Cooper’s father, talked about how much his daughter loved I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She had offers at three other universities, and came here on an open event; it was kind of an open house, with one of her girl friends. And in about ten minutes she was like ‘This is where I needed to be,’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She just loved it, and really felt at home here, and I think that’s a tribute to everybody who’s here today, and what you’ve brought to the community and what you’ve brought to the university.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly Wang, George Chen’s mother, thanked the audience, and the two fathers, for helping her feel like she isn’t going through this alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As you all see, it’s not easy, and it’s even heartbreaking, for me to be here, because I know at the end of this trip, coming all the way from San Jose, I won’t be able to see the beautiful face of my son George,” Wang said. “However, I choose to stand here, bravely, because I want to share some of the words from my heart with you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“First, I want to say, with a mother’s heart, I care about you, and I think every student of UCSB, or every college student, is my child.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang urged audience members to always be kind, even in little ways, to the people around them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Wang, several long-time community members – Associated Students Executive Director Marisela Marquez, Ph.D. candidate Melissa Barthelemy, I.V. Community Services District General Manager Jonathan Abboud and Educational Opportunity Program Director Aaron Jones – all spoke about how moved they were by the way I.V. came together in the days after the shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the memorial came to an end, Collins Puente tearfully thanked the audience for attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And thank you to everyone that continues to create and hold space for our beloved community.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arturo Martinez Rivera contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p>Further photos of all of the memorial events held between May 18 and May 23 can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/in-photos-five-years-since-may-23-2014/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
