As part of this series, UC Santa Barbara students, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students and Goleta and Isla Vista residents attended the City Council meeting with the intent of securing a council endorsement for AB 3.</p>\n<p>Williams introduced AB 3 in December 2014 to propose establishing I.V. as a community services district (CSD) to address the lack of self-governance in Isla Vista. A CSD would be funded by local taxes and improve local infrastructure and public services. The Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is a state-mandated agency that oversees the formation of CSDs, however the I.V. CSD would bypass the LAFCO formation process by act of the state legislature.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We can’t continue being unincorporated and keep the status quo, because the status quo has shown to be disastrous. – Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said establishing a CSD is necessary to address the issues facing I.V.</p>\n<p>“We can’t continue being unincorporated and keep the status quo, because the status quo has shown to be disastrous,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Associated Students off-campus senator and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez said a CSD would provide residents the opportunity to voice the community’s needs and to change I.V.’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“AB 3 is the best chance we have to have Isla Visa take control of itself and in a responsible way turn things that are difficulties now into benefits, to turn the reputation of Isla Vista into a boon for the entire area,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>LAFCO commissioner and California Special Districts Association president Craig Geyer said the bill bypasses the LAFCO formation process and should not be included in the Goleta city agenda.<br>\n“The funding source is usually utility tax which is reserved for cities and counties,” Geyer said. “Speaking as a resident of Goleta, I don’t think Goleta has a stick in this fire.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At this point a lot of the information we’ve asked for to make a decision has not been brought forward. We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this. – Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double major Cameron Schunk said the discussion on the financial feasibility report outlining the expenses of a CSD is unrelated to the current passage of the bill to committee. Schunk also said LAFCO “continuously misrepresents facts” regarding details of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Consistently property owners, long-term I.V. residents and other groups have been undermining the passage of the self-governance movement and AB 3,” Schunk said. “To say that AB 3 isn’t self-governance while recommending the existing power structures maintain control is not only disingenuous but also misleading.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said the LAFCO process of discussing financial aspects of a CSD is “crucial” in making the decision to endorse a bill.</p>\n<p>“At this point a lot of the information we’ve asked for to make a decision has not been brought forward,” Soutar said. “We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Lanny Ebenstein said creating a CSD is a long overdue step, as shown by recent tragic events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was tragedy in many respects that led to this proposal coming forward,” Ebenstein said. “It was the clear evidence that the current government structure for Isla Vista is not working.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created. – Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch</p></blockquote>\n<p>Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch said Goleta should not partake in the CSD except to address issues of safety, such as establishing ordinances for Deltopia and Halloween weekends. According to Murdoch, these specific ordinances are county-wide and can be executed from within Goleta without the need for a CSD.</p>\n<p>“By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created,” Murdoch said. “If I.V. was part of Goleta then specific unique ordinances could be drafted to solve these specific unique problems.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, conversations on the CSD’s financial feasibility will not be relevant for months to come and have distracted from the discussion on endorsement of the bill.</p>\n<p>“We will need the feasibility study to determine the rate of the tax but we won’t be determining the rate for maybe another year,” Abboud said. “The CSD law says you’re allowed to have a laundry list of taxes that can be specified later, it’s not important to the fast-paced process of the bill right now.”</p>\n<p>Goleta City councilmember Michael T. Bennett said AB 3 is not perfect, but I.V. issues are intrinsically tied to Goleta city issues and should be supported by the council. Bennett said the effectiveness of the I.V. Recreation and Parks Department suggests a CSD that includes students and long-term residents could be successful.</p>\n<p>“I think as a beginning point it’s an opportunity for people to determine their own destiny,” Bennett said. “What gives me the most faith that it can actually work is, in fact, the Parks and Rec Department. When that was proposed there were many naysayers … but it has succeeded way beyond anyone’s expectation and has shown that it can work with students and those that are residents with the community.”</p>\n<p>After the discussion, committee members took a group vote to postpone the discussion to May 19 to discuss the matter with Mayor Paula Perotte, who could not attend the meeting due to sickness. The motion failed and the committee adjourned to regular meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*This is an updated version of this article.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63107\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63107\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/","id":4699,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4698,4697,4696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders’ Meeting Talks Taxes","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stakeholder_Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stakeholder_Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, students and county administrators gathered for the weekly stakeholders’ meeting Tuesday evening in the I.V.

Clinic building hosted by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office for continued discussions on Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3).</p>\n<p>During this week’s meeting, attendees discussed recent amendments to clarify how the Community Services District proposed by the bill will function if passed by the State Assembly. If AB 3 passes, a CSD would still require approval in a county-level vote.</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said if there is not adequate funding to support a financial feasibility study, it could delay the county-level approval process of AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Theoretically, say AB 3 is signed by the governor by October 11, then the County District Board of Supervisors would determine when to put it on the ballot,” Elliott said. “So, say we don’t have the financial feasibility study done by October 11, they will probably wait before they decide to put it on the ballot.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The district will not be able to operate until a Utility User’s Tax is passed to fund the district. – Community organizer from Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott</p></blockquote>\n<p>Elliott said a vote to implement a Utility User’s Tax (UUT), a tax as a percentage of utility bills, would follow approval of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“The district will not be able to operate until a Utility User’s Tax is passed to fund the district,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, the Assembly Committee on Local Government said William’s office should reintroduce AB 3 if the vote to establish a UUT does not pass.</p>\n<p>“If the tax passes with a two-thirds vote, the District becomes operational and will start providing services,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t pass, the committee recommended putting in a time frame to allow multiple attempts so they suggested ten years, because it’s a nice even number.”</p>\n<p>According to a presentation by Elliott, the CSD would be dissolved after ten years of inactivity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think if there was a way to mandate that the county interact with LAFCO during this process that puts it on the ballot maybe we can say that feasibility will be determined by so-and-so date by LAFCO. – Former A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>Former Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double-major Cameron Schunk said a CSD is the best available way to establish self-governance for I.V.</p>\n<p>“I have concerns about the idea of pursuing a host of alternatives through other channels, when we have a channel right here that seems to be rather unified and, in my opinion, very effective for a lot of good reasons,” Schunk said. “I really have to disagree with the sentiment that this district may not accomplish what we set out to do if the county put it into place.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), an organization which regulates the formation of local government entities, could participate in the CSD approval process through involvement in financial feasibility research.</p>\n<p>“I think if there was a way to mandate that the county interact with LAFCO during this process that puts it on the ballot maybe we can say that feasibility will be determined by so-and-so date by LAFCO,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he supports having separate county-level votes approving a CSD and UUT.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t put the tax in it will only be 50 plus one to pass. With the tax it’s two-thirds,” Abboud said. “I would agree that it shouldn’t be the same just so that it speeds up the process and makes it less complicated it for people.”</p>\n<p>Stakeholders will continue discussion on AB 3 amendments at the I.V. clinic next Tuesday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63109\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63109\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/","id":4701,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4700,4699,4698],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up 5/1-5/4","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WelcomeToIslaVista.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WelcomeToIslaVista.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to two fights and three robberies this past week.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to two fights and three robberies this past week.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP units found a Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) student lying face down in the street on the corner of Camino Majorca and Sabado Tarde. The victim had a bloody nose and told officers he was “knocked out” by an approximately 6’1” white male adult, possibly named “Devin,” with blonde hair, wearing glasses and a dark shirt. An ambulance took the victim to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, units responded to a report of a fight with one subject unconscious on the 6600 block of Abrego Road. The fight had already dispersed when law enforcement arrived. Witnesses said one suspect, SBCC student Malik Williams, fled the scene and ran into a residence on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive. Williams had knocked the subject unconscious and caused two lacerations on the victim’s face. An ambulance transported the victim to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. Williams was positively identified in a line-up by witnesses who captured the fight on cell phone cameras and was booked and taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Sunday, a victim reported a robbery at his residence on the 6500 block of Seville Road at approximately 4:30 a.m. He told dispatch he last saw the three subjects, two of whom were armed, heading south on foot on toward El Colegio Road. All of the subjects wore masks, dark clothes and hoodies and still remain at large. According to the victim, the suspects asked him for marijuana and money, then took his laptop and phone so he wouldn’t call 911.</p>\n<p>Monday, four IVFP units responded to a report of numerous subjects arguing over drugs and money at approximately 2:00 a.m. at the same apartment building on the 6500 block of Seville Road where Sunday’s burglary took place. Upon arrival, two units noticed one subject fleeing the area and pursued him on foot. The subject remains at large. Moments later, two remaining units detained a suspect exiting the complex with a knife and contraband. The last unit then detained a vehicle with four subjects which contained narcotics. The case is still under a sheriff’s department investigation, with all five detainees having been arrested and one remaining at large.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, Foot Patrol is “pretty certain” the suspects detained Monday are the perpetrators of Sunday’s armed robbery.</p>\n<p>“They basically just hit the place next door,” Plastino said. “The suspect description was the same. The investigation will determine whether they’re the same people from the night before but we’re 99 percent sure.”</p>\n<p>Monday evening at approximately 5:30 p.m., IVFP received report of another armed robbery on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road involving “4 to 5 black male adults armed with a firearm,” according to a UCSB Alert. The suspects remain at large and IVFP is currently investigating.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he believes Monday’s incident is not related to the armed robberies that occurred Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n<p>“I would guess they’re not from the area, but you never know,” Plastino said. “Typically you’ll get gangsters from other counties coming into I.V. to take advantage of students and residents here.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said armed robberies are “unusual” for I.V.</p>\n<p>“Typically you’ll see two to three here per year — they do happen, but not often,” Plastino said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63106\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63106\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/","id":3784,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3783,3782,3781],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Proxies are defined as temporary stand-ins for Senators unable attend Senate meetings who must be approved by the Board of Directors and are able to vote for the absent Senator, according to the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“Senator proxies cannot be people that have declared their candidacy to run in any on-going elections,” Santos said. “I added in this highlighted piece that says Senator proxies cannot be current executives.”</p>\n<p>According to On-Campus Senator and second-year religious studies and philosophy double major Jennifer Liem, the Fraternity and Sorority Council changed their name to the Multicultural Greek Council, so Article VI of the A.S. Legal Code should be updated accordingly.</p>\n<p>“I think that we should also change the Fraternity Sorority Council, because I am on that council and we changed that name to Multicultural Greek Council,” Liem said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassandra Mancini said the A.S. legal code should list the new Professional Greek Council as a Greek community alongside the Inter-Fraternity Council, Collegiate Panhellenic Council, National Panhellenic Council and the Multicultural Greek Council.</p>\n<p>“Apparently it is a new thing,” Mancini said. “They just started getting their stuff together.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said the bill to update media and publicity policy would link the official A.S. page to the A.S.

The evening ended with long-term I.V. houseless resident Clyde performing Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth” on the guitar.</p>\n<p>Hedges said while many people think of houselessness as an abstract problem, it is actually an issue made up of individuals.</p>\n<p>“They are not a population,” Hedges said. “They are persons who you can meet and know by name and by stories, not by what group they’re a part of.”</p>\n<p>Anyone can become houseless given unfavorable circumstances, according to Hedges.</p>\n<p>“In a blink, any one of us can become homeless,” Hedges said. “We’ve seen it happen. A house burned and that family becomes homeless. During the landslide, a lot of those folks became homeless for a while.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while nonprofit organizations need to create opportunities for houseless people, they should not try to “fix” them.</p>\n<p>“We stepped in and gave them [houseless people] a key to provide opportunity and advocacy to get their lives back together,” Hedges said. “They take it upon themselves to better their lives.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said houseless people have died in I.V. this past year, specifically his friend, Little Rick, who passed away after struggling with addiction and depression.</p>\n<p>“He ended up dying behind that … liquor store in Isla Vista,” Hedges said. “He drank himself to near death then died of hypothermia that night. He had no will to live, and it broke my heart.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said people need to stop stigmatizing houselessness because it creates a “self-fulfilling” cycle.</p>\n<p>“There’s a set of characteristics homeless people have — low self-esteem, difficulty holding a job, etcetera,” Rawlings said. “If you tell them they can’t make it or they’re inferior or can’t do certain things, they will lose the motivation to try.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said society’s conceptions on homelessness do not reflect the root of the problem.</p>\n<p>“We carry in our heads bullshit of how the world really works,” Rawlings said. “What is true and what is legitimization — stories we tell ourselves that makes us feel better about the world.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said common ideas on houselessness often underestimate the influence of economic and social forces.</p>\n<p>“Poverty is seen an individual problem — people are poor because they don’t work hard. They’re not the toughest of the lot, but that’s not true,” Rawlings said. “The basis of these B.S. theories on inequality is through an overemphasis on being individuals.”</p>\n<p>Common Ground Santa Barbara Volunteer Coordinator Stephen Gruver said houselessness is much harder than perceived.</p>\n<p>“You end up filling out dozens of paperwork to apply for anything, and people say homeless people are just getting free handouts, which may be true, but they’re working hard to get even the simplest things,” Gruver said. “I want to change the stigma that being homeless is easy.”</p>\n<p>Longtime Santa Barbara county houseless resident Jim said he wishes meetings like Houseless Awareness Night were more frequent.</p>\n<p>“I’m grateful it happens in the first place, it’s a good step in the right direction, but more needs to be done,” Jim said. “Only an hour and a half can’t even begin to explain what we go through every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Jim, being houseless in Isla Vista is like living in a “war zone.”</p>\n<p>“At night we get this breeze from Alaska that will be like 10 degrees — you can die of hypothermia,” Jim said. “The kids don’t care and will run over you with bikes and you’re constantly living in a state of fear from being attacked or mugged or raped by anyone. The people here don’t give a damn about us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/","id":4697,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4696,4695,4694],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The series of events aims to provide students and I.V. residents the opportunity to learn how AB 3 could benefit the community and to advocate for I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>Williams introduced AB 3 to the State Assembly in December 2014 to establish a Community Services District (CSD) with the ability to levy taxes to provide residents with improved local services and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the events are meant to motivate and inform students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s educational, and it’s also in the hopes of empowering people to do work surrounding AB 3, be involved in the process, to really engage with both the bill and the concept of self-governance,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board member and second-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the key to successfully advocating for AB 3 is to educate I.V. residents by canvassing door to door.</p>\n<p>“I really think it’s just getting the word out,” Dela Cruz said. “There’s no way that we can just mail something out and hope that everyone knows about this. You literally have to go and knock on doors and talk to people. So it’s more talking to them and having them engage in the conversation that we’re having.”</p>\n<p>Williams said community engagement will be key to ensuring the events over the next two weeks are successful.</p>\n<p>“This is the time to show the Legislature that local support exists for AB 3, a bill which will create a community services district to meet the specific and unique needs of Isla Vista,” Williams said in an email. “Having backing from the County of Santa Barbara and surrounding cities is crucial to show the need for more direct government in this area.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 supporters being present at this week’s meetings and next week in Sacramento will be key to the bill’s success.</p>\n<p>“Bottom line is we need Isla Vista community members to rally together and be heard in the Legislature,” Williams said in an email. “Their presence is critical to ensure passing of this bill. Their voices need to be heard. They know the challenges first-hand and can serve as a strong force to move this bill successfully through the legislative process.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said AB 3 is unique piece of legislation because it was developed through I.V. stakeholders’ collective efforts.</p>\n<p>“Usually, legislation kind of just comes from Sacramento,” Schunk said. “To the contrary, Das Williams and his office have really kind of stepped up to the plate and done what I think is an outstanding job of really engaging the community.”</p>\n<p>Williams and the Initiative are asking for increased community involvement because of the bill’s importance to the I.V. self-governance movement, according to Schunk.</p>\n<p>“This bill is so monumental, so it deserves extra attention,” Schunk said. “Every resident of Isla Vista will somehow be impacted by this, so I think it’s critical that we try and hear from as many voices as possible.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said, while he hopes to see a significant number of supporters turn out for the County Legislative Committee, Goleta City Council and LAFCO meetings, he has realistic expectations.</p>\n<p>“I would like to see at least 10 people at each of those meetings, and I don’t think that’s going to be outlandish,” Schunk said. “The more voices that are heard by these different entities, the more they realize that there is a broad and diverse backing for this movement.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he knows Associated Students will have a significant presence at the AB 3 events, but believes there will also be a strong turn out from non-A.S. students.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, I do expect a lot of A.S. members to be there, because those are typically the people who are politically engaged,” Schunk said. “I also do think that we’ve gotten quite a few students both from SBCC and from UCSB who are not involved in student government.”</p>\n<p>According to Dela Cruz, the series of events aims to also include non-student residents and Latino families who are not as involved in the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“We had canvassing for the Family Fun Day … where we had volunteers to help us canvas, and just talked to the community,” Dela Cruz said. “Specifically, families for the Family Fun Day geared towards Isla Vista long-term residents and Latino families who don’t often come to our weekly AB 3 meetings on Tuesdays.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the goal of the AB 3 events is to show Sacramento legislators there is broad local support for the bill.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we are seeking endorsements from the County and Goleta as well as the residents of I.V. itself, getting people to every event is going to be challenge due to the meetings being scheduled during work/school hours and out of our control,” Abboud said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Food Co-op Outreach and Education Coordinator Ashley Audycki said the Co-op wanted to host a potluck at the Pardall Center, and the meeting attendees decided the dinner should take place May 25.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and linguistics major and IVTU Vice President Alexandra Meallet said there should be forums for open discussion surrounding the series of memorial events.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s still a time when we’re becoming more comfortable with speaking about it [the May 23 tragedy] and I think open group discussion is pretty healthy,” Meallet said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Pardall Center staff member Natalie Dimas said her sorority Sigma Alpha Zeta has been discussing arranging a Zumba class if they could secure funding and coordinate with the Pardall Center staff.</p>\n<p>“Dancing can relieve stress and it is a method of coping,” Dimas said. “I’ve been looking around and seeing if I could find a Zumba instructor that would provide the class at a reduced price, if anything.”</p>\n<p>Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) Director Jeanne Stanford said it is important to remember individuals cope with tragedy in different ways and to be respectful of other’s methods if they differ from your own.</p>\n<p>“I am aware of people who don’t want to hear anything else about it … and then there’s people that want to remember it,” Stanford said. “Whether you want to turn away from it or you want to delve into it, we shouldn’t be judging each other.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said C.A.P.S. staff will be available for anyone who wants to talk about the events of May 23 last year, but will not push their services on anyone who does not approach them.</p>\n<p>“We are not saying that anybody needs counseling,” Stanford said. “We didn’t do that last year, because we had just drop-in consultation, because it was an unusual event.”</p>\n<p>Audycki said she thinks local art stores would be willing to help provide craft supplies for an artistic-themed event to commemorate the tragedy and help students heal.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be really therapeutic for some people to be able to create with something that could’ve been destroyed,” Audycki said.</p>\n<p>Puentes said one goal of the memorial events is to tailor them to the variety of ways that students can cope with last year’s tragedy and find healing through community.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we are trying to do is help people access a lot of different ways to be involved, whether it’s more actively or passively,” Puentes said. “We definitely want to make sure that we have mental health and counselling services available to people in a place that is in the community.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said the memorial events will provide an opportunity to honor the students lost and restore faith in humanity.</p>\n<p>“Naturally, as human beings, we remember what happened,” Stanford said. “What we’re doing with remembrances and anniversary events are about community and about restoring people’s faith in humanity.”</p><div

Center Lounge Thursday evening titled “Challenging the Borders of Education: Undocumented Students and Public Pedagogy” to discuss how undocumented immigrants maneuver public education.</p>\n<p>During her talk, Nájera recounted her experiences meeting with undocumented students and the struggles that their community faces in education and immigration reform. Nájera’s past encounters with undocumented immigrants inspired her to do anthropological research for Providing Opportunities, Dreams, and Education in Riverside (PODER), an organization dedicated to serving undocumented students at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>According to Nájera, people need to be taught to view undocumented students as people rather than as a certain stereotype or a number in order to understand issues associated with immigration.</p>\n<p>“That’s where the public pedagogy comes in,” Nájera said, “taking advantage of ways that people can educate others outside the classroom about who community members are, what they contribute, what their dreams and aspirations are.”</p>\n<p>Nájera said she hopes to increase general understanding of the undocumented community through her research.</p>\n<p>“I hope that it broadens peoples’ understanding of the way activism occurs: not always in big demonstrations but in small ways – micro politics,” Nájera said. “And also I hope that it stretches the way we perceive education and where it can occur, not just in classrooms, but outside how people are creating spaces of learning.”</p>\n<p>According to Nájera, she wants to work with members of PODER to help adapt UCR facilities to adequately serve undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“Last year they [PODER] were able to lobby the office of student affairs to create an undocumented students task force representative from all of the major staffing entities: housing, financial aid, counseling, career services,” Nájera said. “They wanted to make sure that in each of these areas where students were going to be present that they had some kind of training about undocumented students.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology and Asian American studies double major Madison Villanueva said she is an undocumented student, and identified with Nájera’s talk. Villanueva said the lack of medical options is one obstacle undocumented immigrants face in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“I do feel that there are more uncertainties that face us who are undocumented after graduating,” Villanueva said in an email. “Currently, there isn’t anything statewide that guarantees some sort of healthcare for all undocumented immigrants.”</p>\n<p>Despite the hardships undocumented students face in the U.S., returning to their countries of origin may mean worse conditions, according to Villanueva.</p>\n<p>“Many undocumented folks also come from countries that are practically in shambles from violence and destroyed economies and returning to these countries are not options,” Villanueva said in an email.</p>\n<p>Villanueva said, as a member of the undocumented community, she experiences more than just the pressures of being a student.</p>\n<p>“The uncertainty of my parents’ future because we are undocumented adds to the stress of being a college student,” Villanueva said in an email. “On top of that, I need to support my family financially while supporting myself at school while trying to not get caught up in anything in the over-policed Isla Vista (because anything police related as an undocumented immigrant is closely related to the threat of deportation.)”</p>\n<p>According to Villanueva, she is glad to have found support at UCSB to help overcome her obstacles.</p>\n<p>“Being undocumented definitely exacerbates pressure and stresses of being a college student, and if it wasn’t for a small supportive community I found in UCSB, I honestly don’t know how I could thrive or even survive,” Villanueva said in an email.</p>\n<p>MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau said she believes Nájera’s research is crucial for helping people understand how the undocumented students “fit into our larger societal structure.”</p>\n<p>“The mission for the MCC is to be a safe space where we can explore some of these difficult issues of race, sexuality, issues that don’t necessarily get brought up in other spaces here,” Thibdeau said. “We like to believe that we are promoting different types of programming and events that reach out to underrepresented populations on our community campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Unafraid” in the Theater and Dance building on Saturday to discuss his work as an activist, which will be followed by an art workshop in which attendees can participate.</p>\n<p>Salgado’s talk, hosted by the Research Center of Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), will explore the challenges he faced as a queer and undocumented man of color in the United States and how those experiences shaped his life. Originally born in Mexico, Salgado moved to Long Beach, California at the age of 12, where he was raised.</p>\n<p>Salgado identifies as an “artivist,” an activist who spreads ideas through art. According to Salgado, he began exploring art as a child to cope with the struggle of language barriers.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been making art all my life ever since I moved to this country,” Salgado said. “I feel that art — especially visual art and drawing — have been a way for me to communicate, especially when I didn’t speak English.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said the hardships he faced helped him realize his passion for sharing ideas through art.</p>\n<p>“My experiences as an undocumented immigrant really shaped what I want to do in my art, which is why I wanted to share some of my experiences through poster work, through comic strips and political editorial cartoons,” Salgado said.</p>\n<p>The event aims to provide an environment for queer students and students of color to feel comfortable interacting with their peers and sharing experiences with one another, according to Salgado.</p>\n<p>“When you are a person of color who’s queer, you have to sort of bring this identity with you, so [I am] creating these spaces for a queer person of color because you feel like you’re not alone,” Salgado said. “There’s this feeling of relief that really takes away the pressure of wanting to show how perfect you are, because nobody’s perfect.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said he appreciates students’ interest in his work, and though people “tend to glorify artists who are dead,” he believes it is important for artists to talk about their own work.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students … were doing their thesis about me and writing about my artwork,” Salgado said. “I’m still alive, I’m an artist, so I should be talking about my work.”</p>\n<p>Richard Moreno, fourth-year communication major and RCSGD graphic designer and marketing coordinator, said Salgado’s talk will address issues faced by the undocumented and queer, or “undocu-queer,” community.</p>\n<p>“Julio’s artivist work within the undocu-queer community made him the perfect guest to host an event for our center,” Moreno said in an email. “Students should attend because Julio Salgado sheds light on a very serious issue facing a community that often does not have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Moreno said he looks forward to learning more about Salgado’s past and current work, as well as participating in the art workshop.</p>\n<p>“I am looking forward to hearing Julio speak about his experiences as an activist in the art community,” Moreno said in an email. “I am also interested in [the] art portion of the workshop as well, even though I am not a very talented artist.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Vaccination with Unknown Indirect Effects” to outline different methods of making public policy decisions regarding compulsory vaccinations.</p>\n<p>Manski is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and an econometrician in the field of rational choice theory, which involves using applied economics to make decisions. The talk focused on how to make public policy decisions using incomplete data and information, specifically whether vaccinations in the U.S. should be decentralized or compulsory.</p>\n<p>According to Manski, welfare economics involves a “social planner” who makes beneficial decisions on behalf of the community and often has to make judgements with limited information, making it difficult for the planner to determine optimal choices for issues such as mandated vaccines.</p>\n<p>“So the kind of knowledge that’s assumed in the literature around social planning, that the planner actually knows everything you need to know in order to solve optimization problems — in the real world we don’t have that kind of knowledge,” Manski said. “We may know some of these things, but we don’t know all of it. It’s definitely going to be true with the vaccination problem.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s a really hard thing to make policy decisions that are controversial like vaccine decisions when our knowledge about the effects of vaccines is incomplete. – Economics professor Peter Kuhn</p></blockquote>\n<p>Manski said elementary decision theory provides specific procedures for decision making using partial information and is a two part process that involves first eliminating the comparatively worse or “dominated” decision option and then determining a method of choosing a generally optimal or “undominated” option. Manski said he believes there are multiple ways of deciding which method is “dominated,” contrary to arguments that there exists one particular way to maximize optimality.</p>\n<p>“The whole point of decision theory is to try to have a kind of explicit procedures for making decisions with limited information,” Manski said. “The harder part — where there’s no agreement to this day — is how we are going to choose a dominated policy.”</p>\n<p>According to Manski, in a decentralized healthcare system such as that of the U.S. people do not consider the social and external consequences of their private medical decisions. This issue leads to government intervention in deciding voluntary or mandatory treatments, particularly vaccinations for contagious diseases.</p>\n<p>Manski said there is a lack of knowledge about the benefits of vaccinations despite the common belief that the more people who are vaccinated, the less chance of a disease.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62945\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62945\" data-attachment-id=\"62945\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/guest-professor-lectured-on-vaccination-and-public-policy/manski_vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430318602\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"66\",\"iso\":\"6400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Manski_Vivian Bui-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62945\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62945\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Manski said the process of determining the social cost function of mandated vaccines uses a simple model that consists of two variables — the costs of getting sick and the costs of being vaccinated. Vaccination will likely lower the frequency of illness, but may also increase medical costs, lead to side effects and infringe on personal medical choices.</p>\n<p>“Mandatory vaccinations improve public health relative to decentralization [and] lowers the illness rate,” Manski said. “On the other hand, mandating vaccination means more people are going to get vaccinated, and that’s going to increase the cost of production of the vaccine, the vaccines may have some side effects, and then they have the real political issue of so called reducing personal freedom.”</p>\n<p>According to Manski, he used the simple model he constructed and applied econometrics to lay out multiple methods of making an optimal choice when determining whether to mandate vaccines with partial information.</p>\n<p>“I sought to assist decision making by juxtaposing several well-known criteria and comparing the policies they generate,” Manski said. “Whether a public health agency should use one of these or some other criterion to cope with uncertainty is ultimately a matter to be decided by the agency.”</p>\n<p>Economics professor Peter Kuhn said Manski effectively presented several options for making judgements on controversial issues like vaccination.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really hard thing to make policy decisions that are controversial like vaccine decisions when our knowledge about the effects of vaccines is incomplete,” Kuhn said. “Professor Manski gives us a good way of making decisions in that world and a way that is dispassionate and scientific and also respects the beliefs and values of everyone in society.”</p>\n<p>Economics professor Shelly Lundberg said Manksi’s talk shed light on how “tremendously important” it is to understand the constraints of public decision-making.</p>\n<p>“I think the paper is not so much vaccination,” Lundberg said. “It’s about dealing with the uncertainty when you’re making public policy decisions and how very difficult that is. I think we have to recognize more explicitly the limits of what we know.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily

scholars, selected UC Santa Barbara mechanical engineering Professor Megan Valentine to receive a Fulbright Scholar Award on December 22, announced in a press release by UCSB on April 27.</p>\n<p>As part of the program, Valentine will research soft material sciences at ESPCI ParisTech, a physics and chemistry college, in the fall of 2015 with ESPCI ParisTech materials science professor Costantino Creton.</p>\n<p>Valentine joined the Mechanical Engineering Department in 2008, after earning a Ph.D. in physics at Harvard University and completing a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University in the Biological Sciences Department. Valentine’s studies in soft materials research focuses on how forces are generated and transmitted in living materials, and how these forces control cellular outcomes.</p>\n<p>Valentine said one goal of her research is to pave the way for women and underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (S.T.E.M.) fields through teaching and outreach.</p>\n<p>“The outstanding record of ESPCI ParisTech in the recruitment and retention of women to S.T.E.M. fields was one of the many attractions in selecting it, and France, for my sabbatical,” Valentine said. “I hope to return to UCSB with a better understanding of how the French educational system engages and supports female students, and suggestions for how the U.S. system could be improved.”</p>\n<p>Mechanical Engineering Department Chair Francesco Bullo said Valentine’s research makes important strides in addressing problems posed in the medical field.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Valentine is an extremely productive and talented researcher,” Bullo said. “Her project, ‘Creating tough, fatigue-resistant materials, inspired by nature,’ leverages her expertise in biological systems and protein engineering while tackling important new problems in materials research, specifically bio-inspired self-healing materials.”</p>\n<p>According to Valentine, the materials in her study operate similarly to the technology in bike helmets, which employ a “controlled collapse” of a foamy core to absorb impact energy and protect our skulls.</p>\n<p>“My focus is on developing materials that can dissipate energy during loading through the controlled breakage of sacrificial bonds,” Valentine said. “This approach of toughening by weakening is not new … but the work proposed here goes further by incorporating reversible bonding schemes that allow the sacrificial bonds to reform when the load is removed, thus allowing the materials to ‘heal.’”</p>\n<p>Valentine said her research builds upon previous studies in producing improved adhesives and drug transportation vehicles, working toward a deeper understanding of the properties of living materials in synthetic systems.</p>\n<p>“I am particularly excited about biomedical applications and the development of materials for use in artificial heart valves, vascular grafts and joint repair,” Valentine said.</p>\n<p>Bullo said Valentine’s research will also allow for a continuing relationship with ESPCI ParisTech.</p>\n<p>“Her selection as a Fulbright awardee recognizes the excellence of her scholarship and her contributions to education and science,” Bullo said. “I am extremely proud of her accomplishments and look forward to the increased interactions with ESPCI ParisTech facilitated by this award.”</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Ryan Tsukamoto said materials research can be applied to many aspects of science, engineering and biomedical processes.</p>\n<p>“I believe that investigation of living materials will provide valuable insight to not only medicine but all fields of science and engineering,” Tsukamoto said. “A better understanding of how living structures interact will definitely enhance medical diagnosis and treatment methods.”</p>\n<p>Valentine said collaborating with Creton’s research group will allow her to broaden her expertise in biomaterials and protein<br>\nmechanics.</p>\n<p>“I will also introduce the Creton group to the novel measurement tools that my group has developed for materials testing, in particular our suite of customized ‘magnetic tweezers’ tools which allow the application of very local forces to soft materials for spatially-resolved materials characterization,” Valentine said. “I also hope that my stay in Paris leads to long-term,</p>\n<p>fruitful collaborations between ESPCI and UCSB.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A version of this story said “Valentine’s studies in soft materials research primarily involve the production of man-made materials”, however Valentine’s studies focus on living systems and the previous is true only for her research with the Fulbright Scholarship. The article also incorrectly stated Valentine received the award on April 27 when she was notified of her selection on December 22. The article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/","id":2770,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2769,2768,2767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Patients Test Positive for Hepatitis","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"People treated at Dr. Thomashefsky’s office have tested positive for Hepatitis B, C and HIV","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>People treated at Dr. Thomashefsky’s office have tested positive for Hepatitis B, C and HIV</h2>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (PHD) announced Monday that patients of Dr. Allen Thomashefsky’s medical office should be tested for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV.</p>\n<p>In November, PHD received notice of a new case of Hepatitis C in one of Thomashefsky’s patients who showed no previous risk factors. Further investigation revealed numerous infection control breeches at Thomashefsky’s office, resulting in its closure in March. As of April 26, six of Thomashefsky’s patients have tested positive for Hepatitis C out of 240 patients, five of which are believed to be new cases.</p>\n<p>According to a PHD press release, four of the six patients who tested positive for Hepatitis C received injections from Thomashefsky’s office on the same day.</p>\n<p>“The new findings released today bring new urgency to the Health Department’s recommendation that any patients of Dr. Thomashefsky get tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV,” the press release states. “People infected with hepatitis C often have no symptoms. Testing is the only way to know if a person is infected.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Often times they occur because individuals may not possess adequate knowledge on infection control practices, or sometimes because standards and modes of practice shift. Adhering to infection control practices, including injection safety, is key to safe patient care and protecting employees from infectious diseases. – PHD Disease Control &amp; Prevention Programs Director Paige Batson</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, PHD Deputy Director Susan Klein-Rothschild said PHD cannot be certain if the newly infected patients were exposed to Hepatitis C in Thomashefsky’s office until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) completes molecular genetic testing.</p>\n<p>“We do not yet have scientific confirmation that those who have newly diagnosed Hepatitis C acquired this virus from his [Dr. Thomashefsky’s] office,” Klein-Rothschild said in an email. “We await the results of molecular genetic testing from the CDC.”</p>\n<p>Director of Student Health Dr. Mary Ferris said blood-borne viruses like Hepatitis C do not spread easily.</p>\n<p>“These diseases … they usually require a significant blood exposure such as a deep needle puncture, not just a drop of blood on intact skin,” Farris said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Disease Control &amp; Prevention Programs Director at PHD Paige Batson, infection control breaches like those found at Thomashefsky’s medical clinic happen because medical professionals are not educated in safe practices.</p>\n<p>“Often times they occur because individuals may not possess adequate knowledge on infection control practices, or sometimes because standards and modes of practice shift,” Batson said in an email. “Adhering to infection control practices, including injection safety, is key to safe patient care and protecting employees from infectious diseases.”</p>\n<p>Ferris said information explaining proper disease and infection prevention procedures is readily available to medical offices.</p>\n<p>“An entire body of scientific knowledge is available to guide us in how to minimize the risk of spreading infections through both cleaning and prevention,” Ferris said in an email. “Health professionals specialize in setting up these programs and monitoring their success.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Infection control breaches can occur at any time in a clinical practice. It is sometimes the little things that can place patients at risk from infection control breaches. – PHD Disease Control &amp; Prevention Programs Director Paige Batson</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Batson, even seemingly minor mistakes — like lapses in hand washing — in a medical office can cause infection control breaches.</p>\n<p>“Infection control breaches can occur at any time in a clinical practice,” Batson said in an email. “It is sometimes the little things that can place patients at risk from infection control breaches.”</p>\n<p>First-year electrical engineering major Millan Batra said the story of Dr. Thomashefsky’s medical office makes him wary of medical offices.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s bullshit that they would let an infectious disease run rampant like that,” Batra said. “It means there were procedural problems.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

MultiCultural Center (MCC) lounge on work being done within the undocumented student movement to create new learning spaces and to expand people’s perspectives on who can be a teacher.</p>\n<p>The talk, titled “Challenging the Borders of Education: Undocumented Students and Public Pedagogy,” is part of the MCC’s Race Matters series that features professors leading discussions on the types of adversity different racial groups face. Najera will focus her discussion on how undocumented students are engaging in activism in the public education system.</p>\n<p>Najera said students should be aware of minority groups on and around campus.</p>\n<p>“If we want to be informed and engaged in our society, we cannot ignore our neighbors and what they might be going through,” Najera said. “It is important for UCSB students to know who is in their community, what issues, politics these people are facing and the situation they are in to help us make better choices.”</p>\n<p>MCC publicist and marketing coordinator Carol Dinh said Najera’s talk aims to create a safe atmosphere for students to discuss undocumented students’ challenges.</p>\n<p>“This lecture in particular will help bring more attention to the status of undocumented students at our university, with the aim of creating a safe space where students can ask questions and learn how to be proactive to defend the right to education for all young people,” Dinh said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we want to be informed and engaged in our society, we cannot ignore our neighbors and what they might be going through. – UC Riverside Professor Jennifer Najera</p></blockquote>\n<p>Only five to 10 percent of undocumented students graduating high school have the opportunity to attend a university, and even fewer receive financial aid, according to Dinh.</p>\n<p>“[These students] are an integral part of our campus … and are a marginalized group that are ‘unseen,’ as their status is often times kept private,” Dinh said.</p>\n<p>Najera said undocumented students are diligent in educating themselves and others about their cause.</p>\n<p>“What I have seen in my research is that they are actively creating learning experiences outside their classrooms,” Najera said. “They are involved on an everyday level and on education projects, whether it be educating themselves about immigration policies or ways they could be participating in the community to educating other people.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major Isabel Czarnecki said undocumented students have the same right to education as their native-born peers.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great cause because even if you aren’t documented, everyone deserves a right to an education,” Czarnecki said. “I don’t think their citizenship should declare the education they can or cannot get.”</p>\n<p>Dinh said the MCC hopes students who attend the talk will leave with a different perspective on undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“We hope that by exposing students to the adversities faced by undocumented students that they can slowly begin to shift and shape their world view and language,” Dinh said.</p>\n<p>According to Dinh, the MCC created the Race Matters series to educate students on the challenges their classmates may be facing.</p>\n<p>“Race Matters is a series of interactive discussions that probe or explore issues related to race on a deeper level and examines its continued impact on marginalized communities within larger societal structures,” Dinh said. “The MCC hopes to broaden awareness and contribute to an ongoing dialogue and reflection on important issues.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate voted to fund Active Minds and denied the Persian Student Group’s request because it already received funding this school year.</p>\n<p>Co-president of UCSB Active Minds Lilia Goldenberg said the group will host guest speaker Meg Hutchinson and an open-mic night for students on May 20 to discuss the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“[Hutchinson is] a poet and a songwriter who uses yoga and meditation and suffers from bipolar disorder,” Goldenberg said. “We’re opening it up into an open mic night afterwards in light of the tragedy, so we want to bring out student artists and pretty much anyone who wants to express anything that they feel in regards to the tragedy.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>There should be exceptions to every rule for certain things, including things like sexual assault, mental health. There are some issues that are bigger than normal precedents and I think we should fully fund them. – A.S. CCS Collegiate Senator Liam Stanton</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. Senator and second-year economics and accounting major Steven Kwok said Senate should grant Active Minds’ request for $1,000 to fund the event, despite Senate’s precedent to not fund Office of Student Life (OSL) student groups.</p>\n<p>“I know we set a precedent not funding OSL groups, but because of the gravity of all things coming together next month I think we should grant this request,” Kwok said.</p>\n<p>A.S. CCS Collegiate Senator and second-year CCS physics major Liam Stanton said he agreed with Kwok that Senate should make an exception to the rule given the sensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>“There should be exceptions to every rule for certain things, including things like sexual assault, mental health,” Stanton said. “There are some issues that are bigger than normal precedents and I think we should fully fund them.”</p>\n<p>The Senate voted to grant the full $1,000 for the event.</p>\n<p>A.S. Chief Financial Officer and fourth-year psychology major Andre Theus said Senate should not fund the Persian Student Group’s request for $500 for food at the upcoming Persian Student Group culture show because it already granted the group funding earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>“If you had read the minutes, you would have known that,” Theus said. “Lead with your heart on decisions, but also lead with the legal code.”</p>\n<p>Theus said A.S. must adhere to the legal code because it affects future decisions for unallocated funds.</p>\n<p>“We set a precedent of not using that Senate unallocated money,” Theus said. “That’s not what the purpose is.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The University of California system was built on a foundation of quality, affordability and accessibility for the state. And, yet, in the last few decades, the state of California has shown a pattern of consistent disinvestment in how it funds higher education — currently students are paying for the bulk of the funding for higher education. – A.S. Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy said Senate can pull money from the Internal Vice President’s (IVP’s) special projects fund because she recently increased its funding.</p>\n<p>“Senate unallocated funding has been used to fund A.S. groups that need additional revenue for programs or projects,” Guthy said. “When I was going through the budget, my top priority was re-funding groups that got cut. I did increase special projects funding for IVP so that’s where senate can pull from for some of its projects.”</p>\n<p>Senator Matthew Santos said he did not feel comfortable voting on Guthy’s proposed budget with so many senators absent.</p>\n<p>“Right now there are more proxies here than there are people,” Santos said. “I’d much rather take a vote with all of our senators present because I’d rather have Daisy and Nadia and Koo and Iseah and Firenze and Jenna.”</p>\n<p>The senate voted to table the budget proposal for one week.</p>\n<p>Theus said the UC system has lost sight of its original goal to bring an affordable education to its students.</p>\n<p>“The University of California system was built on a foundation of quality, affordability and accessibility for the state,” Theus said. “And, yet, in the last few decades, the state of California has shown a pattern of consistent disinvestment in how it funds higher education — currently students are paying for the bulk of the funding for higher education.”</p>\n<p>Theus said he updated the Financial Resource Guide to show students where UC tuition goes.</p>\n<p>“This guide has been designed to help students understand how much they pay on the UC level, the UCSB level and into the Associated Students,” Theus said. “This resource aims to make these fees more transparent for you and to help you navigate the complicated financial procedures that revolve around funding.”</p>\n<p>Letters and Science Collegiate Senator and third-year history of public policy major Zach Goulhiane said the Study Bean, the Davidson Library coffee counter, will operate 24/7 during dead and finals week again Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>“We got the results for the 24-hour café,” Goulhiane said. “We lost only 500 dollars, so that’s good, so they put it past the board again and they accepted it so we’re gonna have a 24-hour café again for this quarter.”</p>\n<p>According to External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year political science major Melvin Singh, the recently launched “Dear Governor Brown” campaign to address tuition hikes is attracting national attention and creating a platform for students to discuss concerns.</p>\n<p>“It’s been about 24 hours, but I have people from elsewhere messaging me saying, ‘Why is this a California thing?’” Singh said. “‘Why don’t you make it a nationwide thing?’ Basically, we created a place for people to talk about problems and validate what’s going on when it comes to tuition increases.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
