The resolution was first introduced during last week’s meeting and then tabled until yesterday.</p>\n<p>The resolutions’ demands for Napolitano included holding mandatory trainings for UCPD on the rights of undocumented students’ and other underrepresented groups, having UC staff training on the issues that undocumented students experience and supporting the Trust Act, which Governor Jerry Brown recently signed into law.</p>\n<p>Several audience members who spoke at Public Forum had also attended last week’s meeting and reiterated their reasons for supporting the resolution. Anisha Ahuja and Katlen Abu Ata issued a prepared statement on behalf of A.S. Human Rights Board, emphasizing the confusing process by which Napolitano was elected and the threat they believe she poses to members of the undocumented community.</p>\n<p>“We, the UC Santa Barbara Human Rights Board, stand in solidarity with communities that have been attacked and further marginalized under the leadership of Napolitano during her term as Secretary of Homeland Security,” Ahuja and Abu Ata stated. “We aim to create a safe space and advocate for all students, regardless of races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientation and classes. We work to pressure the University to uphold these standards and qualities of fair and equal treatment.”</p>\n<p>Gloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS said passing the resolution would show solidarity with other UC campuses that have already passed similar resolutions.</p>\n<p>“Passing a vote of ‘no confidence’ — it has so much weight in terms of being in solidarity with other Campuses and being able to say UC Santa Barbara will have no confidence with you because of your history,” Campos said. “These concerns are valid. I don’t know how else to convince you all.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Norma Orozco said the resolution presented a critical opportunity for the senate to take a definitive stand on a pressing issue.<br>\n“At UCSB I’ve seen a lot of student politicians, and A.S. is supposed to be a place for everyone. It’s supposed to be a place that creates student leaders. I really want you all to take this idea really to mind, to heart…as a leader,” Orozco said.</p>\n<p>Following public forum and administrative tasks, senators debated the resolution themselves. Off-Campus Senator Derek Wakefield said that public forum showed how little opposition there was to the resolution, and that he could not see clear negative consequences to it.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have students saying that they oppose this resolution coming to the senate,” Wakefield said. “Voting yes on this would not be negative. No students are going to be suffering if we say yes.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Off-Campus Senator Jimmy Villarreal said he did not feel the demands outlined in the resolution directly applied to Napolitano’s role as UC President.</p>\n<p>“The most important part should be the demands that were made,” Villarreal said. “I don’t feel that the demands actually fall under Napolitano’s job description.”</p>\n<p>Senator Amir Khazaieli said he doubted the bill would yield tangible results.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like this bill for one main reason, not because of the ‘no confidence’ clause but mainly because it fails to introduce tangible results that will change our campus for the better,” Khazaieli said. “Let’s make some directives and let’s add it to the resolution.”</p>\n<p>Other senators took issue with the “aggressive” language of the bill, such as Off-Campus Senator Jake Orens, who felt that Napolitano should be given a chance to act as president before being attacked.</p>\n<p>“I think she has a chance and I think the bill can be revised…but I just don’t feel comfortable with how aggressive it is,” Orens said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus said the aggressive tone is actually a point in favor of the bill.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think being aggressive is necessarily a bad thing,” Theus said. “I have seen so many things come out of the senate office…because of decisions that were aggressive but that needed to happen…A lot of things aren’t ever going to change in the world if you’re not being aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Beatrice Contreras, who authored the resolution, urged the senators to move to a vote and let their vote speak for them. After the vote, Contreras said the decision could set a dangerous precedent for the Senate.</p>\n<p>“I feel like from now on, [members of the communities affected by the resolution] are going to be very hesitant about approaching us, they’re going to be very hesitant about asking us anything, hesitant about us representing them,” Contreras said. “We have to earn their trust and their respect back.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/","id":3060,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3059,3058,3057],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Officers Search for Suspects After DP Stabbing, Assault ","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UCSB Police Department officers are actively searching for two suspects in connection with a stabbing incident that occurred just after midnight Saturday morning on the 6500...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UCSB Police Department officers are actively searching for two suspects in connection with a stabbing incident that occurred just after midnight Saturday morning on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive, according to the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>Sherriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover said the incident began with a verbal altercation between a group of about four people and two males that escalated when one victim was stabbed in the back and another was hit in the head with a bottle.</p>\n<p>Officers responded to 6579 Del Playa at approximately 12:20 a.m. and were unable to locate any of the four original suspects — three males and one female — after searching the area extensively, Hoover said.

Now her track record is making many students question her ability to prioritize the needs of undocumented UC students, and various students groups — such as Human Rights Board, the Black Student Union and UCSB Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (a coalition of undocumented students) — all formally denounced her appointment at yesterday’s Senate meeting.</div>\n<div>Napolitano was appointed by the UC Regents to replace Mark Yudof as UC President in July, with all but Student Regent Cinthia Flores voting in favor of her appointment.</div>\n<div>At Public Forum, students and other community members voiced support for a unified resolution called “A Resolution in Support of Undocumented Students and Immigrant Communities,” which presents several demands to recently appointed Napolitano. The Resolution concludes by stating that, if passed, the Senate expresses “no confidence” in Napolitano’s ability to perform as UC President. However, as of press time, Senate decided to not vote on the issue and wait until next week to reach a final decision.</div>\n<div>Katlen Abuata of Human Rights Board was the first to approach the A.S. Senate with her support of the resolution, and Abuata said Napolitano’s appointment jeopardizes the safety of certain minority communities on campus.</div>\n<div>“You all are here and you have the extreme privilege of representing a diverse group of students; some of these students are undocumented,” Abuata said. “Some of these students have a fear of having a leader of their UC system being someone that deported hundreds of thousands of people.”</div>\n<div>Second-year Mohsin Mirza, who also came on behalf of HRB, said the process by which Napolitano was selected does not reflect the interests of the general UC student population.</div>\n<div>“I think we need to highlight the fact that her appointment in the first place was completely undemocratic,” Mirza said. “None of [the potential candidates] have any experience with education … As student leaders here, you’re asked to represent the students … I don’t see a group here saying ‘We love Napolitano. We want her to be here.’”</div>\n<div>Gloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS provided a personal testimony of her experience as an undocumented student, explaining why she felt Napolitano was a detrimental influence to the UC system.</div>\n<div>“I am an undocumented student. I was at that meeting yesterday with Napolitano,” Campos said.  “I can’t say how I felt … to have someone that has caused so much damage to our community — not only students who are undocumented, but students who aren’t undocumented who have parents [who] are undocumented … I don’t know if you can understand what that feels like to have her as our new UC president.”</div>\n<div>Liam Stanton, another student at Public Forum, provided another perspective on the resolution. While Stanton said he disagreed with Napolitano’s appointment, he urged Senators to move forward through open negotiations, rather than a vote of no confidence.</div>\n<div>“The reality of it is that now she is the president of the UC system,” Stanton said. “I don’t believe that an utter show of no confidence gets us anywhere.”</div>\n<div>Fourth-year Norma Orozco also came to Public Forum to stress the negative impact of Napolitano’s appointment on undocumented students at UCSB, saying that UCSB should value their undocumented community.</div>\n<div>“This year, in fact, we have the largest amount of undocumented population at UCSB, and it’s something to be proud of,” Orozco said. “It is our duty, our responsibility, and it is our right to tell her that we have no confidence in her.”</div>\n<div>Chancellor Henry T. Yang also spoke at the meeting, assuring the student body that he would be available for any necessary support. Additionally, Off-Campus Senator Jake Speyer announced he would be transferring schools after Fall Quarter, and therefore resigning from his senatorial position, which means the candidate who received the next most votes during last spring’s elections will be offered the position.</div>\n<div>The executive officers presented their first reports for the coming school year, announcing what projects would be released from their respective offices. These include renovations to the UCen, a student-led classes initiative, a waitlist system to be implemented on UCSB GOLD and a visit by President Napolitano to the campus in November, at which students will be able to directly address her with concerns.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>This article appeared on page 4 of Thursday October 3, 2013′s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">[CORRECTION: The print version of this article was incorrectly titled, “A.S.

You couldn’t be stressed out already … Or can you?</p></div>\n<div>The most common adjustment stressors for incoming freshmen and transfer students include homesickness, roommate issues and the fact that UCSB poses a more difficult academic setting than what incoming students might be familiar with, according to Kirsten Olson, Ph.D. and clinical psychologist at the Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).</div>\n<div>“They might be used to getting all As in high school without working very hard. Then those same study habits don’t work anymore, and they have to work much harder to get the same grades,” Olson said. “It’s similar for transfer students, in that they come from community colleges, and classes here are bigger and much harder.”</div>\n<div>But continuing students can also face stressful issues at the start of the new year, and the ones most likely to throw people into a crisis are relationship problems — from break-ups with a long-distance partner or roommate drama, to family concerns or problems with a professor, Olson said.</div>\n<div>“Relationship problems are the number one issues people come in to CAPS for, and they often cause the anxiety and depression,” Olson said. “Or, anxiety and depression come first, and that causes the relationship problems. Regardless, relationship problems compound everything.”</div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>The Livin’ Ain’t So Easy: Social Anxiety in the Dorm Life</h4>\n<div>Two years ago, third-year psychology major Yasmin Irfani moved into her Santa Rosa triple as an out-of-state student from New York. While her living arrangement anxiety only lasted one week, it shocked her.</div>\n<div>“It was just so odd living in a room with two strangers you didn’t know at all,” Irfani said. “I was an only child back at home. Here, you don’t know how to be yourself yet and there’s that whole thing about trying to not be awkward, when communicating if it’s cool to talk on the phone a bit or to ask for space for your towel.”</div>\n<div>Immediately, the anxiety Irfani felt took a toll on her physical state. “I couldn’t sleep at night for the entire first week because I had been so sheltered in my childhood and I never got to go to sleepovers,” she said. “It was kind of about being on your own, not having family to rely on and wake you up for class in case your alarm didn’t go off.”</div>\n<div>Following those first few days of ‘going away to college’ stress, Irfani came across the UCSB Mental Health Peers when the organization was tabling at the Arbor. She found out about a stress management workshop, a 24/7 counseling line offered by CAPS and a multitude of other services.</div>\n<div>According to Olson, CAPS offers crisis intervention programs, short-term individual therapy and a wide variety of group therapy and counseling. She said there is also the Mental Health Peer Program — the same resource Irfani utilized — which gives students peer-to-peer counseling. “Oftentimes, people don’t want to talk to a psychologist, but rather to somebody they can relate to, in a different way,” she said.</div>\n<div>After talking to Mental Health Peers and a psychologist, Irfani said her worries about dorm life and other living adjustments were lifted.</div>\n<div>“After that, the rest of my transition was totally fine because I knew that I had that support. If I ever needed anything, I could do drop-in, schedule an appointment to talk to Mental Health Peers or a psychologist or call the 24-hour line,” Irfani said. “I didn’t feel alone anymore.”</div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Alcohol and Drugs: A Quick Fix?</h4>\n<div>But for some students, the path to relieving stress is not always so straightforward. Back in January, Lauren Pierce, a third-year political science and global studies double major, regularly engaged in Greek life and sustained an active social and academic life typical for most college students. But in spite of her seemingly well put together front, Pierce had recently experienced the loss of her mother, who passed away on New Year’s Day.</div>\n<div>“I was there to see her at the hospital an hour before she passed,” she said. “Everything was fine and we were like, ‘Well, I’ll see you later.’ An hour after I left, she ended up passing away.”</div>\n<div>The experience left Pierce with a flurry of newfound emotional struggles, even as she attempted to continue her day-to-day life at the start of Winter Quarter.</div>\n<div>“I was more stressed on the simple question of, ‘What am I going to do now?’ My mom is gone.” Pierce said. “As soon as school started, I went into hyper-drive, thinking that I can’t let this bother me. But it was eating at me.”</div>\n<div>While Pierce received her worst GPA and faced other struggles that quarter, she said she continued to hide her pain from those around her. “I’m that kind of person who can literally put up a front that I’m fine. So, people around me didn’t know how to talk about it with me,” she said. “I didn’t want to take down anyone else’s day. I thought I had to remain composed, but it started to take a toll on me.”</div>\n<div>Eventually, Pierce began turning to alcohol to numb some of these negative emotions.</div>\n<div>“When you feel the urge to grieve, yeah it’s a shock, but if you hold it in, it’ll come out during really bad times,” Pierce said. “Like for me, for the first month of Winter Quarter or so, I was becoming best friends with alcohol. I knew it was wrong and I knew it wasn’t helping, but I tried to find something to fill that gap.”</div>\n<div>According to Lacey Johnson, a Drug &amp; Alcohol Program counselor, the unfilled gap that Pierce referred to is not uncommon for other students. Johnson said current trends indicate students have a hard time figuring out healthy ways to lower their anxiety levels and can sometimes resort to alcohol and drugs as an easy relief.</div>\n<div>“I see it all the time,” Johnson said. “It’s actually not so much a trend, as it is a constant.”</div>\n<div>The reason behind this constant, Johnson said, could be the discrepancy between the perceived and actual use of potentially addictive substances amongst college students. Citing data from a National College Health Assessment study in 2011, Johnson said that while about 76 percent of college students admitted to using alcohol in the past 30 days, the perceived use of alcohol was actually much higher — at 98 percent.</div>\n<div>The study also revealed that while about 40 percent of students admitted to using marijuana in the past 30 days, the perceived use of the drug was a surprising 96 percent. Additionally, while the actual use of drugs other than marijuana was only roughly 15 percent, the rate of perceived use of these substances came out to 82 percent.</div>\n<div>Johnson encouraged students to take a holistic approach to dealing with stress and explore different types coping mechanisms — such as exercise, yoga, artistic expression, socializing, watching movies or enjoying the outdoors.</div>\n<div>“Try not to use substances as a form of coping,” Johnson said. “Find other healthy ways. Maybe these things are being involved in a sport or a hobby that you can continue doing at UCSB, or maybe consider trying new things to deal with stress here.”</div>\n<div>The Alcohol &amp; Drug Program offers services like free and confidential counseling or support groups for anything from marijuana moderation to the development of healthy family relationships, Johnson said.</div>\n<div>“We are a nonjudgmental service, here to help students on campus make safe and healthy decisions,” Johnson said. “We really understand what’s going on at UCSB and at Isla Vista, so we’re here to meet students where they’re at and give them the support they need.”</div>\n<div>Navigating through Stigmas and Finding Campus Resources</div>\n<div>For Pierce, her healing did not begin until she opened up to a friend, who also happened to be her Bible study leader and urged Pierce to find solace in her religious faith. While Pierce said she understands why others would reach out to counseling or psychological programs, she chose to turn to her faith.</div>\n<div>“I kind of wish I could’ve went to therapy or something, but I don’t know,” she said. “When you come from my kind of family — with Dad being a military man — family problems are familyproblems, not therapist problems.”</div>\n<div>At CAPS, Olson said she noticed stigmas are a big reason for people to skip out on therapy or counseling aid during stressful situations, “Sometimes people think they go to therapy because they’re crazy, weak or something’s wrong with them. Okay, certainly people come in when they’re in crisis, but you don’t have to wait until you have a crisis, and all because you come to therapy does not mean you’re crazy or weak.”</div>\n<div>UCSB currently offers an array of programs serving these emotional needs and Jackie Kurta, clinical manager of the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, said one such program is ‘Gaucho FYI’ — a new service that provides 90-minute educational workshops for students in groups of 25 to 30.</div>\n<div>“There’s something good about being in a small group with your peers,” Kurta said of the program. “Plus, the students leading the workshops are from all different kinds of organizations on campus, like CAPS, Health &amp; Wellness, the Women’s Center and UC Police Department.”</div>\n<div>In addition, Health Educator at the Health &amp; Wellness Program Michael Takahara said programs like Gaucho FYI act as an innovative method to approach first-year and transfer students and introduce them to the wide variety of programs and departments on campus.</div>\n<div>For example, the Health &amp; Wellness Program uses research strategies to improve students’ well-being, offering weekly training courses and holding workshops on topics like communication skills and healthy eating, Takahara said.</div>\n<div>“Not only are we plugging the students to go to the Recreation Center and Student Health to work on their physical health, CAPs for mental health and Health &amp; Wellness for social health, but we’re also promoting the idea of working on your full being,” Takahara said. “This is about health from not just one part of your life, but as a whole — as a human being, a student, a worker and a community member.”</div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Stress That Can Build Toward Depression and Suicide …</h4>\n<div>According to CAPS statistics, Olson said suicide is the second leading cause of death amongst college students, “We’re doing a lot of campaigning and outreach efforts to let students know about warning signs of suicide, [like] how to be a bystander for intervention and help students recognize the signs, not only in themselves but also in a friend.”</div>\n<div>The same statistics, Olson noted, revealed that 50 percent of graduates and undergraduates report feeling depressed and at some point have trouble functioning, and she said social engagement can act as the best solution for these struggles, such as “talking to friend, family member, TA or RA.”</div>\n<div>For third-year pre-biology major Nathan Pinckard, his strong connection with his family, friends and faith helped him overcome a severe allergic reaction to a prescription acne drug, Accutane, and the brief sweep of suicidal thoughts that ensued.</div>\n<div>“What was hard, emotionally, was that my confidence was destroyed and broken down, and I couldn’t look people in the face anymore. I would avoid the mirror when I was in the bathroom,” Pinckard said. “Psychologically, I had never really contemplated suicide before, but during that time, the thoughts were kind of there. They weren’t at the forefront of my brain, but they were in the background: ‘You could end your suffering now.’”</div>\n<div>But Pinckard didn’t.</div>\n<div>With strong support from his family and friends, as well as staying connected to his Christian faith, Pinckard said he was able to come out of his depressive episode.</div>\n<div>“I was constantly on the phone with my mom and dad during that time,” Pinckard said. “A lot of it was family support and any support system. There was the Intervarsity [Christian Fellowship] community, full of prayers — that’s what got me through it.”</div>\n<div>Pinckard said he dispelled stress by taking long walks, reading other people’s similar stories on online forums and listening to Bob Marley, but most of the relief consisted of open communication.</div>\n<div>“When you’re stuck in your head and you’re thinking and thinking, you’re not getting rid of stress,” Pinckard said. “What helped was the communication with family and support groups. I then got in contact with my dermatologist again, and she prescribed me two different drugs, both of which really helped me get back on track.”</div>\n<div>Stress: the Conquerable Foe</div>\n<div>So maybe the first week of school isn’t so stress-free after all. But don’t fret, Gauchos. Stress is conquerable.</div>\n<div>Olson urges students to seek out support in any way they find comfortable, whether it is the utilization of a campus service, finding support in family and/or religion or just seeking out a simple conversation with a friend.</div>\n<div>“College is about discovering who you are, discovering yourself as a person and having healthy relationships,” Olson said. “We’re here not only to make people successful students, but also to make sure they become successful Gauchos and successful people in general.”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the September 26, 2013 print issue.</em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It’s like Thizz-neyland.</p>\n<p>As a school that prides itself in being environmentally conscious (#10 in the Sierra Ranking), we also generate a shit-ton of trash in the form of red cups, incinerated furniture and general waste.  We’ve consistently had the highest voter registration rate of any college in the nation, and we are the 22nd most socially conscious campus (Washington Monthly) and one of the top 25 LGBT-friendly campuses in the country (Campus Pride Index). Yet we still lack the socio-economic diversity of most other UC’s, with the highest average parental income of any UC and the smallest proportion of minority groups.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Demographics are shifting though, and this year’s freshmen are the most diverse and academically lauded of any class in the school’s history.

Congratulations on reaching UCSB — a top-ranking school with never-ending good times.</p>\n<p>UCSB: cutting-edge research, a thriving arts community and progressive social efforts, coupled with coastline scenery, Mediterranean climate, beautiful students and a whole lot of adventure.</p>\n<p>In this issue, you’ll find an extensive guide for navigating your way around this little paradise, with its incredible academic opportunities waiting around every corner (think Nobel Laureates and world-renowned science), as well as its offering of incredibly enjoyable, if not ever so occasionally sketchy, beachside activities. Work and play can so easily mesh into one nasty mess. And yes, we like to get rowdy. After all, we’re the only school in the US with its own beach.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Late nights spent partying/ booty popping on Del Playa balconies and countless hours spent studying at Davidson can create a blur that is only cleared by some sense of direction. But while we’re a giant public university with huge lecture halls and thousands of students, we have direction. We’re directed in our ability to act as a uniquely united student body, one that produces revolutionary research and holds serious organizing abilities unlike any other school.</p>\n<p>We’re also physically close — there’s 17,000 people living in the tiny (less than one square mile) tract that is Isla Vista. And when you’re living in close quarters like these, there’s bound to be sparks flying and maybe a little trouble brewing.</p>\n<p>But the times you spend on this campus, the people you meet, the passions you continue and create, and all of the work you do, have the power to impact your life in amazing and nearly unimaginable ways. Don’t be afraid to reach beyond your comfort zone. Find your niche on campus or in the community, whether through student groups or other networks. Do your absolute best in every class and every activity because this is your only chance to do so. Realize that these next few years come once in a lifetime. And above all else, enjoy it.</p>\n<p>On the cold, concrete walls of the Nexus office, in all its Storke Tower-trolling glory, you can see a mural of chalked quotes from the Nexus alumni of decades past. The smeared and scattered lines can look like a mirage of now-abandoned stories of forgotten glories, but they’re not. They’re the marks of generations who will always value the Nexus, and this timeless camaraderie is something I hope you find on this campus. But for now, just enjoy those first weeks of fall, put your best foot forward and don’t sweat the little things.</p>\n<p>Here at the Nexus, we will continue our tradition of serving the best — and only entirely student-run and independent — editorial content, featuring daily coverage of campus and community news, as well as a breakdown of sports, local arts and entertainment, science and technology news, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>During these next four years, you’re basically molding your entire future. So why squander this gift? Value it. Don’t just settle for a mediocre experience, or create shitty habits that will damage you in the long-run.</p>\n<p>Shout out to all the booty poppers worldwide.</p>\n<p><em>Marissa Wenzke is the editor in chief of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/letter-from-the-editor-welcome-to-paradise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/letter-from-the-editor-welcome-to-paradise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/letter-from-the-editor-welcome-to-paradise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/letter-from-the-editor-welcome-to-paradise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/letter-from-the-editor-welcome-to-paradise/","id":3482,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3481,3480,3479],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Work When you Need to, Play When you Want to","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/houses.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/houses.jpg?resize=960%2C588&ssl=1","description":"Balancing the pressures of school with the intensity of IV social life can be tough to get the hang of.

And the I.V. Foot Patrol station has deputy escorts available until 3 a.m. on weekends.<br>\nStay in lit areas<br>\nSome areas in I.V. are not that well lit, particularly ones further away from campus or farther from the coastline.While many students know DP is arguably already the best-lit area, Plastino said it is currently being retrofitted with new LED lighting “that will really brighten up the street.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t Hesitate to call 911 in an emergency</span></p>\n<p>Don’t put your concerns about getting busted in the way of others’ safety.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t Walk around in public with an open container of alcohol</span></p>\n<p>Most people know better than to walk down DP holding a red cup half-filled with beer, but this citation is one of the most common, if not the most. Carrying around a previously opened container of liquor will result in an open container violation that includes over $100 in fines. And doing this when you’re not yet 21 carries a much heftier penalty, including “a mandatory court appearance, as well as a mandatory suspension of your driver’s license for a year, up to $675 in fines, or proof of completion of the Youth Offender Program,”according to the IVFP site.</p>\n<p>Don’t sit on the curb</p>\n<p>Just don’t do it.</p>\n<p>Safe DrinkingTips</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t Drink too quickly</span></p>\n<p>Drinking quickly can cause your blood alcohol level to spike sharply and potentially lead to alcohol poisoning, so pace yourself.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Know your limits when drinking</span></p>\n<p>Jason Vego, a campus liaison for the Alcohol and Drug Program, recommends starting slow if you’re new to drinking. With many students drinking out of those ubiquitous red cups, some party-goers fail to consider the true volume of alcohol entering their bodies, Vego said. It’s also important to take note of the difference in alcohol content of hard liquor versus alcoholic beverages like beer and wine.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Eat before drinking</span></p>\n<p>The human body naturally wants to eat every three to four hours, so you’ll want to put some food in your stomach before going out, Vego said. Satisfying those alcohol-induced munchies by eating after (or during) drinking is not proven to help lower blood alcohol concentration, although it can lessen the intensity of a hangover.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Drink plenty of water</span></p>\n<p>Drink water between drinks, as well as before and after drinking. Dehydration is the leading cause of hangovers, and that’s that shit no one likes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6><em><span style=\"color: #000080; font-size: x-large;\">Cracking the Books</span></em></h6>\n<h6></h6>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Go to office hours</span></p>\n<p>Within their first quarter, most new students find themselves crammed in massive lecture halls, amongst a sea of hundreds of other students. Attending office hours and building relationships with professors can bring valuable opportunities like performing research or receiving much-coveted recommendation letters further down the road. “You don’t need to have anything profound to say when you talk to your professor. Just introducing yourself and saying hello will get it started,” according to Dr. Dorothy Mullin, communication professor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Use campus resources</span></p>\n<p>The piles of ‘free’ activities, food and services are never-ending at UCSB, and in some way or another, they’re always needed. CLAS tutoring can help with academic struggles, while Counseling and Psychological Services, Career Services and the Health and Wellness can help with other areas of life. Even Associated Students and the Office of Student Life sometimes hold fun and helpful events, while offering other services. There’s also a Gaucho Skills page on Tumblr that includes 500 study tips from experts at UCSB.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Prioritize your work</span></p>\n<p>Making fancy Snapchats or beating your friends at beer pong might seem like a pressing concern at the time, but procrastination bears an ugly head come Midterms or Finals Week. “There’s no such thing as catching up on the quarter system. You’re either half a step ahead, or blowing it,” Paul Rivas, academic skills coordinator for CLAS, said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t skip classes</span></p>\n<p>Some professors seem to, or actually do, just read out of the book. Why get out of bed when you can learn everything at home? Because you’re paying for the lecture, and chances are, the classes you skip will miraculously include specific material that will be on the test.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t View classes as worthless</span></p>\n<p>We all need to get those General Education Requirements out of the way, so we end up taking classes seemingly irrelevant to our major or interests. But the fact is that diverse knowledge is the key to a well-rounded education, and a positive attitude can turn a ‘worthless’ class into a passion or even change of major.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Join a campus club or activity</span></p>\n<p>Whether you like exercise, activism, religious worship or even journalism, don’t be afraid to take advantage of what UCSB has to offer. There are groups for all interests, cultures, sexual orientations political causes, and if there isn’t one that suits you, then start one!Gladys Koscak, mental health specialist at Counseling and Psychological Services, said extracurricular activities are vital in maintaining a stress-free lifestyle. Likewise, Vice Chancellor Michael Young said he encourages students to explore their usual interests, but also “take some risks.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Take advantage of the beach</span></p>\n<p>The only school nationwide with its own private beach, UCSB is just minutes away from the shore. Start the morning off right with a relaxing jog, or try out surfing. With our high-ranking surf team, we’ve been recognized by Surf Magazine and other outlets as a top competitor in the sport.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Explore the Santa Barbara area, get away from campus</span><br>\nCheck out the Santa Barbara Zoo, go shopping or out to dinner on State Street, hike the Santa Ynez mountains or organize a group to go bowling. With the bus system free for all students, there is no reason to be stuck!<br>\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"> Maintain healthy relationships</span><br>\nA solid support network of people you trust is essential in keeping stress at a minimum, Koscak said, noting that such bonds can alleviate stress and loneliness.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Remember to take care of yourself</span></p>\n<p>Try to incorporate stress-relieving strategies into your routine as early as possible. As Koscak explained, stress is not necessary to the student experience, “It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that college students have to be stressed to be considered legitimate students,” Koscak said. “The truth is that the sooner you can find ways to cope in healthy ways, the better time you will have in college.”</p>\n<h6><em><span style=\"color: #000080; font-size: x-large;\">Beyond I.V.</span></em></h6>\n<p>– Swim, surf and just soak up some sun at Goleta Beach, Sands, or Campus Point<br>\n– Take an adventurous hike through Lizard’s Mouth, Inspiration Point, or the Santa Ynez Mountains<br>\n– Go cliff diving at Red Rock and plunge into its gnarly swimming hole<br>\n– Hit up State Street for high-end shopping and dining (the 24X bus goes straight there from the dorms)<br>\n– Check out the West Wind Santa Barbara Drive-In Theater<br>\n– Get in some late night ‘glowbowling’ at Zodo’s Bowling and Beyond<br>\n– Check out live music at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Velvet Jones or SoHo downtown</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/","id":3483,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[3482,3481,3480],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A to Z Treasure Map of Art to Find at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/art1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/art1.jpg?resize=960%2C640&ssl=1","description":"Artsweek editors Demi Anter and Audrey Bacheldor present a map to all of the creative treasure Santa Barbara has to offer.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Hello fellow Gauchos!

One of the ways UCSB supports this cause is through Battle of the Bands, which takes place every winter quarter in The Hub. Five local bands compete for the coveted opening spot of UCSB’s Extravaganza (see: X,), the spring quarter music festival. The best part about Battle of the Bands is that all kinds of music get showcased — last year’s bands consisted of rock and punk, reggae and funk. It’s seriously cool to check out I.V.’s latest and greatest talent for a free, tune-filled night. Mosh pits are usually welcome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The</strong> <strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">C</span>atalyst</strong></p>\n<p>Back for the first time in 6 years, the Catalyst literary magazine is a place where student fiction, poetry, art, photography, lyrics, expository profiles and creative writing meet in print.

The best. We at Artsweek are huge fans of drag and have touted it before as possibly the highest form of art. At UCSB, you can experience drag at least twice a year during Pride Week. The campus’s queer advocacy organizations host a “Student Drag Night” as well as a night for professional performers. The events are free, fun and inspiring. Other drag events can sometimes be found at Wildcat downtown and at other clubs. We highly recommend going to all of them.<strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">D</span>rive-In Movie Theater<br>\n</strong></strong></strong>One of the littler known fun things to do in Goleta, the WestWind Santa Barbara Drive-In is probably the coziest date or cutest family hang out you could have. Movies start around 7 p.m., and you get to watch two features for seven bucks per person. Tuesday movie deals are $5. Just remember to bring some comfy blankets, a car with good speakers (sound comes through the radio) and maybe a pillow or two. Buttery popcorn and other goodies are sold in the lobby, and if you’re nice to the popcorn guy you could score a free blockbuster poster. He will also offer to jump your car just in case it dies in the middle of the movie, leaving you unable to witness anything but a mute screen. This has happened. Twice, actually.<strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51357\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51357\" data-attachment-id=\"51357\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/chilla-vista-2013-the-vibes-were-sweet/chillavista8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"chillavista8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-51357\" alt=\"chillavista8\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8-1024x683.jpeg?resize=610%2C406\" width=\"610\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-51357\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Earth Day Festival takes place at one of I.V.’s 25 parks every April.<br><em>Daily Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">E</span>arth Day Festival<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong>To commemorate Isla Vista’s commitment to a green community, Earth Day Festival takes place at one of I.V.’s 25 parks every April. Present are booths on energy conservation and calculating your carbon footprint, plus a sweet hunk of wood that transforms throughout the day as everyone paints on it. One of the coolest stations is the arts and crafts table, which is covered in hordes of neat recycled materials like buttons, bottle caps, corks and vintage postcards. Local bands perform all day for the hula-hoopers, slack-liners and girls wearing flower crowns. It’s a perfect way to spend a lazy afternoon.<strong><strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">F</span>OMO<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>FOMO: Fear Of Missing Out. You will experience this a lot in the next four years as most nights, there are more than a couple great options for how to spend your evening. There will be nights you will have to decide between going to your best friend’s art show, seeing Thom Yorke dance around a stage and sleeping. You will always have to decide between ____ and doing homework. Here’s my advice: If you can’t find someone to go with, see: G: Going to events by yourself. If you feel like you “should” go, you probably should. But if you haven’t slept in days and Cynthia will be so mad if I don’t show up to this thing and then she’s gonna make me take shots and then I’m gonna have to — JUST GO TO BED.

But it’s a haven for local artists and art lovers. The Funk Zone is located from about the end of State St. (where it goes under the freeway, nearing the water) to Garden St., between Montecito St. and Cabrillo Blvd. It’s an industrial area that has drawn artists to open studios and gallery spaces with the promise of cheap rent and local, like-minded people. It has gotten more gentrified in the last few years with the opening of some higher-end bars, eateries and wine tasting rooms (Seven, Red’s, Municipal Winemakers, Union Ale and Metropulos being just a few you should check out). But the heart of the Funk Zone remains utterly funky.<strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://funkzone.net/\">http://funkzone.net/</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">G</span>aucho Nights Calendar<br>\n</strong>2013 marks the new startup launch of the After Dark Gaucho Nights Calendar. After Dark is an organization that funds programs alternative to an I.V. party. As part of a commitment to safe and sober fun, the Gaucho Nights Calendar lists events ranging from recreational, entertainment, social and cultural, designed to cure every student’s after 5 o’clock boredom. Events are posted up every day on both the calendar and the GN Facebook page. Be sure to check out localendar.com/public/gaucho.<strong><br>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">G</span>oing to events by yourself<br>\n</strong></strong>Okay, everybody hates to do it. I hate to do it, to the point that I (Demi Anter, Artsweek Editor) missed entire meals freshman year because I wouldn’t go if I didn’t have someone to eat with. Listen, at some point you’re going to be like, Fuck it. WHO CARES? No one’s going to see you head-nodding to Yo Yo Ma by yourself and say, “Oh, that’s so sad … Look at that poor lonely person.” And if they do, that’s not someone you need to impress. Your self-confidence is impressive. Here — this is the key to going to stuff by yourself: Before or after the event, go outside in the common area, turn off your phone, and stand there. Wait. You will run into someone you know, or meet a new friend. Be open. Trust me. There’s too much cool stuff happening here to miss out every time you can’t convince a buddy to take the twenty-minute bike ride to Pollock Theater with you.</p>\n<p><strong>The </strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">H</span>ub</strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p>The Hub is a funny thing —during the day, it’s a spot to eat your Panda Express orange chicken bowl. By 6 o’clock on a Friday night, all the tables have been removed and it’s turned into a swanky, foggy night club. Flosstradamus has destroyed beats on The Hub stage (he came last year), and so has cool dudes The Dirty Heads (crowd surfed during this show two years ago) and SoCal groovy duo Best Coast (lead lady Bethany’s pseudo bitchy remarks about performing in front of The Panda Express were oddly refreshing, according to Natalie O’Brien).</p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">I</span>mprovability<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong>Improvability is the funniest place on Earth. It is the longest running comedy show in Santa Barbara, and is the premiere improv group in the city. Come for the free cocoa and stay for the laughs every Friday night at 8 at Embarcadero Hall.<strong><strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The </strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">J</span>ailhouse</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p>A little past the 68 block (those outback boonies of I.V.), you can walk the stairs, go down the beach towards Sands and the Goat Farm and you’ll see a cement structure called the Jailhouse. Covered in graffiti and sand, the Jailhouse bursts with the griminess that comes with being a college student. Guy friends come here to hang out, open up a bottle and a spray can and make art. Beer cans, glass and spray paint line the corners, but this garbage is almost beautiful. If you feel like exploring the ghosts of I.V.’s past, check out The Jailhouse and see the colorful remains of many a good time shared amongst friends. It’s a haven for bonding and inspiration, an elephant graveyard of many intoxicatingly happy nights on the beach.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">K</span>CSB<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>KCSB-91.1 FM, is UCSB’s radio station. Operated by student DJs and professionals, KCSB brings the Santa Barbara community quality programming all year long. It’s super easy to get involved: Watch out for news and fliers about orientation meetings and find out how to get your own show. Because it’s non-commercial, the range of music and other material the DJs explore through KCSB is always eclectic and unique.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">L</span>ocal Bands<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p>Although electronic dance music (EDM) is the more popular music genre in Isla Vista, it’s not too hard to find other styles and even live music. Just this past year, I.V.’s relatively small music scene featured a jazzy-funk and hip-hop band, a few reggae bands and a few punk bands. The best part? The shows are usually free and everyone is welcome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51244\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51244\" data-attachment-id=\"51244\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/ucsb-to-restore-self-sustaining-habitat/immigrants-william-zhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Immigrants-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1367951488\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"85\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Immigrants William Zhou\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Immigrants-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Immigrants-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-51244\" alt=\"Award-winning actress and playwright Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni performing her one-woman play, “One Drop of Love: A Daughter’s Search for Her Father’s Racial Approval” at the MCC.

Almost every night, the MCC Theater is home to an interesting screening, dance performance, reading, Q&amp;A, open mic … and the list goes on! It is also an invaluable presence on campus for students of color and other underrepresented groups, and for anyone hoping to expand his or her worldview.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">M</span>usic Library<br>\n</strong></strong></p>\n<p>The Music Library just might be the most underrated place at UCSB. It has musical scores, books, videos, CDs and vinyls. Students aren’t allowed to take the CDs and vinyl out of the building, but can listen to them in personal listening rooms. These listening rooms are also a great place to study, especially during finals when the Davidson Library is packed. The Music Library is located on the second floor of the Arts Library (across from the UCen).</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">N</span>ational Geographic Live! Series<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>You know how there’s that one person in your family who is always out in the Caribbean or swimming with elephants or something? That’s how Artsweek likes to think of the photographers and explorers in the National Geographic Live! Series brought to us by A&amp;L (see: A) — they’re the cool aunts and uncles who always have a good story to tell. This year, three photographers and one underwater explorer come to Campbell Hall to chit chat about surviving flesh-eating parasites and irritated grizzly bears, discovering the secret lives of birds of paradise in the New Guinea forest, hanging out with geishas in Japan and swimming in the ruins of the Titanic.<strong><br>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">O</span>pen Mic Nights</strong></strong></p>\n<p>Open mics are a great way to meet people and witness local talent in the Isla Vista and Santa Barbara community, and are an even greater way to broadcast your own! You can see comedians, singers, rappers, poets and all manner of musical instruments at these popular free events. Open mic dates and times often change quarter to quarter but keep an eye out for events put on by the MultiCultural Center (see: M), ASPB (see: A), and other groups and venues. College crowds are often receptive and full of energy, making performing fun. It’s also fun to just go and watch performances. Open mic nights at Gio’s (Giovanni’s) on Pardall get packed though, so be sure to come early!</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">P</span>rogram Board, Associated Students<br>\n</strong>This A.S.-funded crew puts together shows, movies and miscellaneous events constantly. Free movies are screened at I.V. Theater on Tuesdays, and every Wednesday some raw local band performs at Storke Plaza at noon. ASPB uses The Hub (see: H) as its club-like venue. Spring quarter you’ll probably find a giant bounce house looking thing inhabiting the lagoon lawn with a long line of people waiting to get in. This is the Luminarium sponsored by ASPB, and it’s worth the long line.

The festival plays host to actors, actresses and filmmakers contending for the Academy Awards, and is known to foreshadow the winners of Best Picture and Best Actor/Actress. Think of it as your passport to seeing celebrities like <b>Jennifer Lawrence</b>, <b>Quentin Tarantino</b> and <b>Amy Adams</b> (just a few of 2013’s guests), plus a neat ticket to a wide array of films shown at the oldest and most historic theaters on State Street. The best part? It’s pretty easy to get involved in the festival as an usher, merch seller or even a reporter on the red carpet if you think writing for Artsweek might be in your future ….</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">S</span><b>poken Word</b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Spoken word is a big deal on this campus. There is a strong community of performers ranging from comedians to poets who hit up open mics (see: <b>O</b>) and ASPB’s yearly poetry showcase. These performers are some of the best of any college campus. The biggest reason for this is Prof. Kip Fulbeck’s Art Studio class, “Art 137: Spoken Word.” The class’s quarterly shows at the MCC Theater are legendary, and always packed, but to truly understand why you’ll have to check them out for yourself. Prof. Fulbeck, ASPB, and the MCC also bring out a range of spectacular artists every year. <b>Beau Sia</b>, <b>Anis Mojgani</b>, <b>Saul Williams</b> and <b>Mayda del Valle</b> are just a few who have graced our campus in the last three years.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">T</span><b>heater/Theatre</b></strong></p>\n<p>There are many types of theater/theatres on campus and throughout Santa Barbara. There’s the <b>Theater &amp; Dance Department</b>, which puts on innovative plays and moving dance performances throughout the year with the help of our BFA acting and dance students. There’s the <b>Pollock Theater</b>, a beautiful building that plays host to ritzy film screenings, often followed by equally ritzy free wine and cheese. Off campus, there’s <b>I.V. Theater</b> (free or near-free film screenings) and the Arlington Theatre (host to A&amp;L and SBIFF events). There’s also the <b>Lobero Theatre</b>, one of the oldest, most haunted buildings in Santa Barbara (also currently under construction but it will open with its usual season of music and more in December). The <b>Granada Theater</b> is another beautiful old building on State St. in the heart of downtown, and is home to operas, orchestras and more. Finally, for lovers of “the Theater”, local writers and actors put on fantastic stage shows regularly at <b>Center Stage Theater</b>, as well as the <b>Garvin Theatre </b>and <b>Jurkowitz Theatre</b>, both which were reopened in 2012.</p>\n<p><strong>1st </strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">T</span><b>hursday, Downtown</b></strong></p>\n<p>On the first Thursday of every month, galleries and shops downtown from the Funk Zone (see: <b>F)</b> TO State St. open their doors and celebrate new art exhibitions and fantastic performances with free wine and cheese. Check out our calendar for listings or just wander downtown on the 1st Thursday of each month to see what you can find!</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">U</span><b>niversity</b><b> Art Museum</b></strong></p>\n<p>The Art, Design &amp; ArchitectureMuseum at UCSB is a great place to visit for art and art history lovers. Adjacent to the UniversityCenter, the museum is located in the heart of campus and is a free resource where students can stop by any time to view current exhibitions. Exhibits range from private donor collections to work done by artists from the Master of Fine Arts program on campus and are alternated every few months. Exhibits are curated by museum staff and student interns who are interested in pursuing a career in curation and museum management. The museum is open Wednesday through Sunday from 12 p.m.-5 p.m. and admission is free.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">V</span><b>agina Monologues</b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Every February, female students in the Theater and Dance Department put on the Vagina Monologues. The episodic play written by Eve Ensler brings empowerment to women in an open dialogue on topics such a sex, rape and menstruation. The play is both insightful and comical and is a fun way to support female clubs on campus!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51632\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51632\" data-attachment-id=\"51632\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/wordstock-hits-its-stride-in-second-year/img_4700/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_4700-e1369957195553.jpg?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.4\",\"credit\":\"Picasa\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SX50 HS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369483824\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"4.3\",\"iso\":\"80\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.001\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4700\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_4700-e1369957195553.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_4700-e1369957195553.jpg?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-51632\" alt=\"WORD\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_4700-1024x767.jpg?resize=610%2C456\" width=\"610\" height=\"456\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-51632\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">WORD is an IV arts and culture magazine.                                                                                <em>Daily Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">W</span><b>ord Magazine</b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To all you kids who ruled high school yearbook and don’t want to lose your InDesign/PhotoShop skills like the Spanish you tried mastering (Four years of Spanish and all I can say is gracias.

Every spring quarter A.S. Program Board works their tails off to make this event a smashing hello to summer. Last year <b>Kendrick Lamar, Dada Life, J-Boog, The Growlers</b>, and Battle of the Bands winners <b>Alpha Phunk</b> rocked the stage, while students took in interactive art installations, food vendors and an acrobat perched on a twenty foot high swing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">Y</span><b>oga </b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yeah, we know what you’re thinking — “yoga is recreational, not an art.” And I guess it’s not an art, strictly speaking. But here’s what you don’t know about yoga: It’s one of the best ways to unleash creative energy and make it pulsate out of your veins. Plus it makes you look good. And a bunch of artists who you wouldn’t guess did yoga utilize it for its magic creative energy/healthy powers. Among the list is <b>Eminem </b>(yep, Slim Shady does downward dog), <b>Chris Martin</b> (lead singer of <b>Coldplay </b>likes it too) and — wait for it — <b>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter</b> (yoga workouts are the reason for her body, apparently). If Beyoncé uses yoga for creative inspiration and her rockin’ booty, we suggest you jump on that bandwagon real quick.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">Z</span><b>aytoon</b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Not exactly an art thing either, but this Lebanese restaurant off State Street is a sweet hang-out spot when you get sick of DLG tacos. The restaurant itself very clearly used to be someone’s house, and the back patio has been transformed into this amazing secret garden-esque hideaway. Twinkly lights dangle from trees, fire pits with glowing blue coals are centered in tables and a nice man plays guitar on Sunday nights. Belly dancers show up on Saturdays, and a Spanish band named <b>Vientos del Sur</b> plays contemporary music on Wednesdays. Food is scrumptious (beef shawarma is highly recommended) and hookah is encouraged for dessert. Yelp it if you’re interested in fine dining, great ambience or late night waterpipe sessions with good friends.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Natalie O’Brien — banjo enthusiast, Cajé patron, assistant art

Speakers also called to question the clarity of the appointment process, particularly with regards to Committee on Committees and Elections Committee.</p>\n<p>University Owned Housing Senator for the 2012–2013 school year Miya Sommers addressed the Senate with concerns about the appointment process. Sommers took issue with the disqualification of Nicholas Dineen for Elections Committee on the grounds of party affiliation, as Dineen had been disqualified after he “liked” a Democratic Process Party Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel that going through someone’s Facebook and seeing something that they like on Facebook is grounds for neutrality,” Sommers said.</p>\n<p>Sommers also said the disqualification process was problematic as there had been inconsistencies for different positions. While Dineen had been originally recommended for the position through the interview process, he had later been disqualified, Sommers said.</p>\n<p>According to Sommers, the appointee for Attorney General Sawyeh Maghsoodloo should have been disqualified on the same grounds, as the attorney general position is also supposed to be a neutral position and Maghsoodloo was a chair of the Open People’s Party during A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“If he’s not being appointed, I have a problem with Sawyeh then being appointed,” Sommers said. “She has a clear party affiliation, and she’s not being docked on that.”</p>\n<p>After Sommers spoke, Maghsoodloo addressed the Senate to respond to some of Sommers’ claims. Maghsoodloo said she agreed the interview process needed improvement, but also said her own appointment had been legitimate.</p>\n<p>Outgoing Chair of Committee on Committees Asami Osato also came to public forum in order to answer senators’ questions regarding the application process. As chair, Osato was responsible for making the official appointment recommendations to the president.</p>\n<p>Osato said she felt the application process had been fair, with the interview process lasting approximately 15 hours every week for three weeks. She also said she felt party affiliation was not difficult to discern with candidates.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s pretty obvious whether or not you’re party affiliated,” Osato said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also decided to approve the appointments and during the meeting, the new executive officers delivered reports on their first weeks in office. Officers announced their decisions regarding their appointments for staff, while also discussing the progress of their respective offices.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore said he met with leaders of the queer community, who had expressed a desire to reach out to members of Greek life on campus.</p>\n<p>“They want to do some Greek outreach because they feel like there’s some problems coming from the fraternities especially,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Alex Choate said she is focusing on the question of online education in the UC system, for which there are currently two bills in front of the California Senate.</p>\n<p>“The bills are SB 520, which we really don’t like because it basically is going to allow for the privatization of our education, allowing for private entities to come in and profit,” Choate said. “Another one is SB 547, but it doesn’t have nearly as much support in the Senate, as of right now.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud discussed the addition of a new position on his staff — the deputy chief of staff — while Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet’s report focused on transitions to the new Senate, discussing projects that must be handed down to new senators, including a Sobering Center in Isla Vista and an LGBTQ General Education requirement.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker said he is working on a convention with the SAGs from colleges throughout Southern California, and that he has already begun working on his advocacy agenda.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/","id":3058,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3057,3056,3055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bike Safety Week Holds Workshop, Surveys on Campus Bicycle Paths","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The A.S.

A.S. Bike Committee will be holding bicycle safety-related events throughout the week.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The A.S. Bike Committee is hosting Bike Safety Week from now until Friday, encouraging students to practice caution while riding through the sometimes-risky bike paths on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee will be tabling at the Arbor all week as well as passing out bike lights and surveys for students to improve their knowledge of bike safety. On Friday, the committee will hold a bike fix-it workshop with a mechanic from the A.S. Bike Shop, allowing local cyclists to learn repair skills and other useful biking knowledge.</p>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee works all year to improve the biking climate of UCSB, with current plans to launch renovations to the bike racks at the Music Building, Humanities and Social Sciences Building and the University Center, in addition to a long-term plan to implement a new roundabout path near the tunnel located by the Recreation Center.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair Mac Kennedy, maintaining the quality of the bike culture at UCSB — which is ranked second only to Stanford as the most ‘bike-friendly’ university nationwide — is a top priority for students.</p>\n<p>“Bike culture is, in my opinion, one of the integral parts of the UCSB student experience,” Kennedy said. “Currently, UCSB is ranked as the second-most bike-friendly university … and we think we can be the best.”</p>\n<p>Bike Committee Chair Emily Littleworth said although she does not believe the biking climate at UCSB is particularly dangerous, it can be daunting for incoming students.</p>\n<p>“If you haven’t biked at UCSB, and you come here for the first time, and you see all the students, it can be overwhelming,” Littleworth said. “I think it takes some practice learning how to ride on the bike paths, learning regular traffic laws that people should abide to.”</p>\n<p>Littleworth said Bike Committee aims to reduce the danger by both improving cycling infrastructure and educating the community on safe biking tips.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Bike Committee is basically devoted to improving the bicycle system on campus at UCSB,” Littleworth said. “We do things ranging from basic improvements on bike paths, to putting in new racks, to putting in bike pumps around campus.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said he hopes to reach out to a larger number of students in the future, as a means of expanding and strengthening the committee.</p>\n<p>“One thing I’m working on for next year is trying to get more general members involved,” Kennedy said. “Because I think we need to democratize the whole process and expand the committee.”</p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 29th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/","id":3117,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3116,3115,3114],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Womyn’s Commission’s annual runway show will take place at the Corwin Pavilion this evening, as part of the group’s ongoing efforts to challenge societal beauty norms and represent the vast diversity of the campus.</p>\n<p>The ‘I Am Beautiful’ Runway Show, which will be held at 5:30 p.m., will include live student-run performances of spoken word, in addition to a runway show and other acts open to student participation. The runway aspect of the event aims to shine light on body image topics that individuals in contemporary society oftentimes struggle with. Students can volunteer to participate in the runway to share their input on body image issues or to provide their own personal testimony. A.S. Womyn’s Commission hosts several events each year, all of which deal with various issues affecting women both on campus and in local communities.</p>\n<p>Kristina Didero, Womyn’s Commisson member and third-year sociology major, said the event will replicate mainstream runway shows but will include other aspects intended to make participants feel more comfortable.</p>\n<p>“It will be made to be as much like a real fashion show — where the model will have their picture taken at the end of the catwalk,” Didero said in an email. “Models are allowed to walk with other people as well, so those who don’t want to walk alone can still feel more comfortable participating in that portion of the event.”</p>\n<p>Popular modern media frequently emphasizes body image standards to an extent that has caused many to become “nit-picky” and “obsessive” with their own bodies, according to Didero, who said these individuals sometimes said never reach total satisfaction with their appearances. Didero said such an unhealthy dynamic should change, as it sets norms that make individuals practice excessive self-criticism.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the phrase ‘great body’ is never associated with anything other than the ideal 36-24-36 type for females,” Didero said in an email. “I personally feel like I don’t go a day without hearing multiple comments from various people criticizing their image and essentially indulging in negative self-talk. The conversation needs to change in terms of this topic, and the focus on appearance should be diminished.”</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Co-Chair Mariam Agazaryan said the ‘I Am Beautiful’ Runway Show will highlight the problems with standardized beauty, while drawing focus to the many different ways one can be beautiful. Agazaryan said discussion of this topic is especially crucial since the vast number of unhealthy living conditions, such as eating disorders, occur as a result of unfair beauty standards.</p>\n<p>“There is no one ideal type of beauty and what the media constantly displays isn’t the only kind of beauty,” Agazaryan said in an email. “We put on this event every year to raise awareness about beauty stigmas and eating disorders that arise as a result of this. Everyone is beautiful. We want to use the show to allow everyone the opportunity to be models to demonstrate what they believe is beauty.”</p>\n<p>Agazaryan said she believes that society’s definition of beauty is flawed as a result of fashion magazines and advertisements that promote unrealistic, and sometimes unhealthy, ideals of beauty.</p>\n<p>“Those ‘beautiful’ people we see are artificially created through Photoshop and digital media,” Agazaryan said in a email. “They don’t exist. I think that beauty is skin deep. I have met so many beautiful people that don’t necessary fit into the ‘standard’ of ‘beauty’ whom I believe are a hundred times more beautiful than what I see in magazines.”</p>\n<p>However, the examples set by these media outlets and advertisements can lead one to practice a sense of self-doubt and self-criticism that is difficult to escape, according to Agazaryan.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to ignore the issue of body image since it’s so internalized,” Agazaryan said. “Everyone at one point or another in their lives has questioned their body image. I, personally, still have issues with my body and it’s been so internalized that it’s difficult to shut it off sometimes.”</p>\n<p>Students can participate in the runway or sit in the audience members, and those interested in modeling can email Womyn’s Commission.</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Historian Olivia Jaffe-Pachuilo, second-year french major, said the campus organization is aiming to encourage self-confidence and appreciation for one’s body.</p>\n<p>“We want to promote body positivity and self-love,” Jaffe-Pachuilo said in an email. “Everyone deserves the right to feel beautiful in their own skin and their own bodies. Ideally, I hope that people would go away feeling empowered and more at peace with their bodies.”</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the May 29th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/","id":3119,"author":{"id":197,"name":"Shannon Ham"},"related":[3118,3117,3116],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":144,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
