Nakamura began studying LEDs when researching and publishing papers on the scarcely studied compound GaN for his Ph.D. and eventually invented the blue LED and white LED in 1993. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Nakamura the Nobel Prize in physics in 2014 alongside Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano, who contributed to his findings.</p>\n<blockquote><p>He has opened the door to affordable energy efficient lighting for every person in every nation — a monumental contribution to all of humankind. – Chancellor Henry T. Yang</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang began the talk by introducing Nakamura, praising his achievements and contributions to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“He was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics not just for inventing the best blue laser, but for being the first to create the brightest blue light, using indium gallium nitride,” Yang said. “Fast-forward to the year 2000, UC Santa Barbara was incredibly fortunate to have Shuji join our campus. His hire was like mounting the jewel in the semiconductor crown at UC Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Yang said he thinks Nakamura’s LED will one day replace Thomas Edison’s lightbulb.</p>\n<p>“We are all here to witness first-hand the brilliance of professor Shuji Nakamura and his blue LED,” Yang said. “He has opened the door to affordable energy efficient lighting for every person in every nation — a monumental contribution to all of humankind.”</p>\n<p>Nakamura began his talk with the history of LED lighting, from growing high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) crystals in 1991, to developing blue LEDs in 1994 and up to the present. The revolution in generating white light, achieved by combining blue light with a yellow phosphor, enables energy-efficient lighting, displays, medicine and the next generation of Blu-ray optical storage, according to Nakamura.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62888\" style=\"width: 264px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62888\" data-attachment-id=\"62888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/shujinakamura_mclane-brown-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL SL1\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430250533\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ShujiNakamura_McLane Brown-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62888\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2-167x250.jpg?resize=254%2C380\" alt=\"McLane Brown/Daily Nexus\" width=\"254\" height=\"380\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“To make the white color, you get the blue color and the yellow color and they make white. This is only two colors so it is cheaper,” Nakamura said, “I invented the blue LED 23 years ago, so since that time many people have told me ‘oh you will get the Nobel Prize,’ but it took 23 years.”</p>\n<p>According to Nakamura, his inventions will allow the world to generate 185,000 fewer tons of carbon dioxide by 2030.</p>\n<p>“Lighting accounts for 35 percent of energy consumption in California,” Nakamura said. “By 2030, 46 percent of electricity is saved.”</p>\n<p>Yang quoted 2000 physics Nobel Prize laureate and UCSB professor Emeritus Herbert Kroemer, who was not in attendance, to describe Nakamura’s impact.</p>\n<p>“Nakamura was the one who made the breakthrough, period,” Yang said. “End of the statement. And no one else was near that breakthrough. Shuji would win the Nobel when LED lightbulbs had replaced Thomas Edison’s incandescent bulbs at Costco.”</p>\n<p>Haruna Morohoshi, a representative from Soraa, the LED manufacturer founded by UCSB professors Nakamura, Steven DenBaars and James Speck, said it took time for the world time recognize the potential in LED lighting.</p>\n<p>“Most consumers don’t understand the energy saving aspect … how much you save every month,” Morohoshi said. “It takes a lot longer for consumers to realize the value of LEDs. I think that’s why 20 years after he invented it, he finally got the Nobel Prize. The world is finally recognizing the value of LED lighting.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting major Hajime Okamoto said he was intrigued by Nakamura’s research and speech.</p>\n<p>“It was great and he was funny,” Okamoto said. “I had to come here because I was really interested.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/","id":2792,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2791,2790,2789],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Meeting Discusses Term Lengths","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stakeholder_Alexander-Payne-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stakeholder_Alexander-Payne-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, county representatives and UC Santa Barbara Associated Students met Tuesday night in the I.V.

Clinic Building for the weekly self-governance meeting held by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office to discuss plans to develop I.V. into a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Stakeholders discussed whether CSD governing board members would serve two-year or four-year terms. According to the language in Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 to establish I.V. as a CSD, all board members would serve four-year terms. With an informal hand vote Tuesday, attendees voted to have one two-year and four four-year board member positions.</p>\n<p>Discussions at previous meetings suggested one of the five elected board members should be appointed by UCSB and another by Santa Barbara County. Stakeholders also continued the discussion from previous weeks on how to set official boundaries for I.V. as a CSD and several attendees expressed preference for including UCSB buildings, such as university-owned apartments and residence halls, within the boundaries of the proposal.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator and second-year history of public policy Paola Dela Cruz said setting a two-year term candidacy for board members would allow more students to run for a position on the board.</p>\n<p>“Just looking at the students who have run for Park District, I think most of them are not first years,” Dela Cruz said.  “Generally it’s second years or third years so that by the time they graduate they have either two or three years on the board. Personally, I think having a two-year position makes it easier.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez said he agrees a two-year term would be suitable, and board members who wish to serve longer could run for consecutive terms.</p>\n<p>“I would probably not run for something that was four years if I was only planning on staying in for two years,” Lopez said. “Couldn’t you just run again for re-election if you wanted to stay another two years?”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk, the two-year position was suggested to address the concern that student board members lack dedication and knowledge.</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve been pretty clear that the goal of that position is to avoid student transiency,” Schunk said. “Let’s address the elephant in the room: we’re worried students won’t be educated enough and informed enough to make decisions on the board.”</p>\n<p>While Schunk said one potential way to develop board members’ experience would be to establish a year-long trial period, during which time their votes will not count towards decisions being made by the board, the proposal was voted down by attendees.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how this works as far as constitutionality or whether it’s legal,” Schunk said. “We could say you have a year where you can’t vote but you are still expected to show up because you are a member of the board.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, including UCSB in the official boundaries of the proposed CSD would pressure the university to make a decision regarding their involvement in I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“To me, including them in the boundaries makes it really clear,” Schunk said. “They can either say they don’t want to be in these boundaries and we can ask them why they don’t want to, or they can say they do and we can come back as a group and ask if we want to let them in.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said she does not feel comfortable allowing short-term residents living in UCSB-owned properties to have representation in I.V. governance.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want people who have not lived in Isla Vista to be making decisions about things that happen out here that they don’t have first-hand knowledge of yet,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p>Because of time constraints, stakeholders made no decision concerning CSD boundaries and chose to continue the discussion at a later meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

IVFP deputies and UCPD officers were informed one combatant likely had a weapon and another may have been thrown off of a balcony. The two male subjects fled the scene as officers arrived. An IVFP deputy caught one suspect, Omar Flores, who had a large laceration to his left arm. The other suspect described as a black adult male wearing shorts and no shirt escaped. IVFP conducted an in-field lineup, and witnesses identified Flores as a combatant in the fight. Deputies transported Flores to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for treatment of his arm.</p>\n<p>Later on Thursday night, witnesses reported seeing the other escaped subject enter an apartment near the scene of the fight. Deputies searched the apartment with consent from the residents and found suspect Darris Lee Cotton hiding in a back room. In another in-field lineup, a witness identified Cotton as the second combatant. Cotton reportedly hit Flores in the head repeatedly with a broomstick, causing injury. Deputies arrested Cotton and transported him to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for possible alcohol poisoning. Both Flores and Cotton were later transported to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Saturday morning, an I.V. resident entered the IVFP station just before 7 a.m. to report suspicious activity from two subjects entering backyards on Del Playa Drive and possibly stealing bicycles. Deputies found suspects 21-year-old Jack Vanantwerp and 18-year-old Dillinger Douglas with two bicycles at 7-Eleven on Trigo Road. The suspects admitted to stealing the bicycles and were brought into custody by deputies. The bicycles did not match any reports.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, deputies found SBCC students Joshua Powell and Keaton Jensen attempting to enter an apartment through a window.

Senators look on as they hear funding requests from campus organizations. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met in the State Street Room of the University Center on Friday to address funding requests regarding reallocation and cultural events.</p>\n<p>Prior to the meeting, the Office of Student Life (OSL) budget responsible for funding campus clubs stood at $0, the Senate Unallocated Budget used mainly for A.S. financial matters stood at $2,872 and the Graduation and Culture week budget stood at $8,831. Of the three clubs requesting funding, the Black Student Union (BSU) received the full request for $4,300 from the Culture and Graduation budget. The Queer People of Color Collective and Active Minds did not receive funding. The committee also granted a request to reallocate funding for an upcoming Sigma Pi Epsilon fraternity fundraiser.</p>\n<p>Black Culture Week co-chair and second-year black studies major Mikayla Williams said BSU’s Black Culture Week event will kick-off with a barbeque May 18 and include several cultural activities, including a film screening, spoken word night and candlelight vigil to remember Malcolm X and Yuri Kochiyama, a Japanese-American human rights activist and a member of Malcolm X’s Organization of Afro-American Unity.</p>\n<p>“Tuesday [May 19] is actually the birthday of Malcolm X so we will be holding an event commemorating his birthday as well Yuri Kochiyama’s, with a candlelight vigil to honor them,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A.S President Ali Guthy also presented the President’s Agenda and said the Academic Affairs Board budget has been cut due to its recent merge with the Office of the Internal Vice President.</p>\n<p>In assessing the allocation of funds for Queer People of Color Conference and Active Minds, A.S. Finance and Business Committee advisor Cindy Lopez reminded senators the OSL budget is at $0 and that senate unallocated fees should be kept primarily for A.S. expenses.</p><div

of Malware” in the Pacific View Room tonight at 4 p.m. as part of the Davidson Library’s Pacific Views: Library Speaker Series.</p>\n<p>Vigna is the co-founder and CTO of Lastline, co-director of the Security Lab and director of the Center for CyberSecurity at UCSB. Vigna’s talk on malware, short for malicious software, will discuss research being developed to fight cybercriminals who quickly adapt to countermeasures being deployed in cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, the lecture will focus on four key questions: “What is malware?,” “How does it operate?,” “How does it affect us?” and “How can the average person protect themselves?”</p>\n<p>“Everyone is susceptible to malware,” Vigna said. “If you’re on the Internet you will be attacked one way or another and it’s important to know how it works.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said the damage caused by malware varies in strength but can create major repercussions, especially for students.</p>\n<p>“Malware can steal personal information, like your bank info, and sell it in the underground market for money,” Vigna said. “They could encrypt your files and ask for a ransom. If you do not have a backup you will not be able to get your files back, which can be especially troublesome for students who may have a project or a big paper due the next day.”</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, writing malware is as difficult as coding any other computer program, varying in strength and complexity depending on the developer’s experience.</p>\n<p>“It takes skill when you want do something very sophisticated that hides its presence very well,” Vigna said. “There is very simple malware … and there is other sophisticated malware that goes deep into the operating system.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said that protecting against malware is a competition between defense and attacker because the superior program comes out on top.</p>\n<p>“You’re against another person trying to make your stuff work against his; it is a battle against one another,” Vigna said. “It’s an arms race.”</p>\n<p>Vigna also said malware changes at a rapid rate because it, and the products developed to detect it, is continuously evolving.</p>\n<p>“We come out with new techniques to detect malware and they’ll come out with new techniques from our techniques, and we have to come out with new way to find theirs,” Vigna said. “It’s continued evolution.”</p>\n<p>First-year film and media studies major Andrew Okeh said students should take cybersecurity classes in high school because they depend on computers now more than generations before them.</p>\n<p>“With this increase in computer use it would be wise to implement basic ‘safe online behavior classes,’ like how we learn about having safe sex,” Okeh said. “I mean it is 2015! Practices like installing anti-malware software, updating computers, not using random networks or downloading stuff from sketchy websites.”</p>\n<p>Second-year computer science major Dylan Lynch said he is interested in attending Vigna’s talk because cyber security is relevant to anyone who uses the Internet.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited to attend the talk because I think computer security is growing to be a really lucrative field,” Lynch said. “It’s very relevant because of all the companies people trust with their personal information.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/","id":2804,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2803,2802,2801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Brimer also said people should view the environment the same way they see their homes and not allow littler to accumulate.</p>\n<p>“If your house is filled with trash, you would not enjoy it,” Brimer said. “The earth is my home so it does make me uncomfortable to see things like littering.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Andrea Renteria said she tabled with her sociology class, Topics in Sexuality, to inform Earth Day attendees that overpopulation is threatening the environment.</p>\n<p>“We are tabling because, if we can control the increase in size of the population, we can lessen problems that directly affect our environment,” Renteria said. “It is through actions where we will see change.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year mathematics major Jose Lombera said students should lead by example to initiate change in the environment.</p>\n<p>“If we recycle more and keep our community clean, more people will follow this positive model which is good to our earth,” Lombera said. “Future generations can better the environment, but it is up to us to make it as great as we can.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_62799\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62799\" data-attachment-id=\"62799\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/i-v-earth-day-highlights-environmental-issues/iv-earth-day-festival-anisqoyo-park-april-25th-2015-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,429\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D600&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1429985213&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.001&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IV Earth Day Festival\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62799\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?resize=600%2C429\" alt=\"80's Alumni band The Tearwayas performed during the Earth Day festival.

Recently, Jackson and Williams have both introduced legislation geared toward ending sexual violence on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Event coordinator Gregory Jarrett said the Capps Center does not endorse specific politicians or legislation but denounces sexual assault as an ethical issue.</p>\n<p>“We are decidedly not neutral on ethics and we do not feign indifference to the fact that this is a profoundly neglected problem not just for the survivors of sexual assault, but for all women and their Title IX right to an equal education and equal protection under the law,” Jarrett said.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson it is currently unsafe for women to walk alone around college campuses, the very environments which are supposed to foster the education of the “future leaders of our state.”</p>\n<p>“According to the Department of Justice, 1 in 5 college women experience rape or attempted rape during their time as a student, and we know that less than five percent of all rapes and attempted rapes are reported,” Jackson said. “I believe we have a duty to continue to transform the culture on our campuses and make them safer environments for our students.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62754\" style=\"width: 332px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62754\" data-attachment-id=\"62754\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/representatives-discuss-sexual-assault-policy-culture/hbj-and-dw_christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429821915\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"HBJ and DW_Christina DeMarzo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62754\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2-250x166.jpg?resize=322%2C214\" alt=\"Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus\" width=\"322\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Jackson, who joint-authored Senate Bill 967 — popularly known as the “Yes Means Yes” law — last year, said the now-passed legislation can affect change if the language in the bill is appropriately enforced.</p>\n<p>“Only ‘yes’ means ‘yes,’ and it requires college campuses to educate students about consent and sexual assault,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said various types of media, such as YouTube videos, trivialize sexual assault and rape and schools need to counter this message with education.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, university disciplinary codes should be strong enough to adequately penalize perpetrators of sexual assault, because survivors often do not want to involve law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“This is criminal conduct and if we cannot find you guilty of a crime;

It’s always fun; it’s always a little nerve wracking during the election period but just now I’m ready to start going to work.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and current EVPSA Melvin Singh said he is apprehensive about the UC tuition hikes and expressed his willingness to aid Mirza and Lopez in their continued work with A.S.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern is seeing how tuition increase and all that will go next year, and making sure both of them are prepped for it, and of course I’m going to be there to prep them before I term out,” Singh said. “I mean I was pretty comfortable being in that room and seeing whatever happened so at this point I’m just making sure both of them are set for their path from now on.”</p>\n<p>Incoming IVP and third-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian said while she is looking forward to taking office, she was disappointed her fellow Open People’s Party EVPSA candidate Lopez lost the campaign.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62781\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"444391965\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62764\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62781\" data-attachment-id=\"62781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/a-s-elections-end-with-near-sweep/elections-will-tran-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429817311\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elections Will Tran-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62781 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Elections Will Tran-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former executives came by to see the election results. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“As a party it’s like we don’t win until we all win, so we were very nervous about the EVPSA position and once his is announced it was kinda like the mood kinda went down,” Hashemian said. “So when mine was announced I was excited but at the same time, you know, in my mind there was still the fact that our EVPSA did not win so it’s not as joyous as I wish it were.”</p>\n<p>Current Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said she is satisfied with her accomplishments during her term in office and is looking forward to the continued improvements to be made by Hashemian.</p>\n<p>“What I hope that she can improve from what I did last year is just to really transition better and do a better orientation for the entire association,” Lau said. “I thought I did a really good job with the senators and the senators I felt like were really equipped with all the different resources and things they needed to know to be in office.

night.</p>\n<p>Three TEDxManhattan videos were presented at the talk, including “Why is Organic Food so *#@! Expensive?,” “How Ugly, Unloved Food Can Change the World” and “Cultivating Equality in the Food System.” Local guest speakers from I.V. were also featured and attendees received free coupons, cookbooks and snacks at the event.</p>\n<p>According to Food Co-op Outreach &amp; Education Coordinator Ashley Audycki, the event was held to prompt local discussion among university students and I.V. residents on sustainable food solutions and to allow individuals working on solutions to meet and exchange ideas.</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major and representative for the Merton cooperative house on Camino Pescadero Doan Ngo said she has a passion for food justice and for purchasing local, organic foods and has identified a way to do it.</p>\n<p>“It all comes down to my conviction that eating organic and locally can have a prominent impact on our environment and economy,” Ngo said. “Before joining SB housing co-op and working at I.V. Food Co-op, I was aware of many food justice issues but failed to eat locally and organically with my very tight budget. I now believe that living cooperatively is the solution to make organic, local food financially sustainable.”</p>\n<p>According to Ngo, as a shopper for Merton, she hopes to change her housemates’ routine of shopping for groceries based on price.</p>\n<p>“I’m attending this talk is because I am currently a food shopper for our house, Merton Co-op, and I would like to deepen my understanding of the issue so that I can educate my housemates,” Ngo said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62635\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62635\" data-attachment-id=\"62635\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/tedx_paris-cullen-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429641325\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"27\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TEDx_Paris Cullen-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62635 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62635\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Ngo said she provides 18 people at the Merton House with organic foods for $100 per month to benefit the local economy as well as the environment which, according to her, is advantageous for multiple reasons.</p>\n<p>“Sharing food with 18 other college students provide us the buying capital to support our local farmers and businesses while reducing food waste and carbon foot print,” Ngo said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Nancy Yang, representing the university’s proposed Food Cart Working Group, discussed a program seeking to launch food carts on campus serving produce from local farmers and vendors.</p>\n<p>“The seeds for this project were really planted about five years ago by a group of students who saw that there was definitely an option for an alternative meal on campus that sought to launch a food cart that was student run,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, students have voiced a need for more healthy and organic options on campus.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to really show both campus leaders and administrators — as well as other orgs — we could partner with that this is something students want,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>EAB Community Food Impact Coordinator Biby Landaverde discussed a sustainable cooking competition hosted by EAB weekly to encourage cooking creatively using simple ingredients. According to Landeverde, participants upload recipes on to Facebook, where the winner is chosen weekly.</p>\n<p>“Every week we have an ingredient … the competition has been going on for two weeks already. The first week our secret ingredient was oranges and then last week our secret ingredient was carrots.” Landaverde said. “Whoever has the most votes at the end of the week is the winner,” Landeverde said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62634\" style=\"width: 315px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62634\" data-attachment-id=\"62634\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/tedx_paris-cullen-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429640983\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TEDx_Paris Cullen-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62634\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1-250x167.jpg?resize=305%2C204\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"305\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Youth Projects representative Maya Topitzer said I.V.

We are actually doing community outreach, providing educational resources to students as well as food to try and help them become self-sufficient in the future.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62769\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62769\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/","id":2802,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2801,2800,2799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Talk To Discuss Sexual Assault","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-DW-Web-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-DW-Web-2.jpg?resize=508%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblyman Das Williams will give a talk titled “Sexual Assault on College Campuses” in Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall today at 8 p.m.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Santa Barbara Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblyman Das Williams will give a talk titled “Sexual Assault on College Campuses” in Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall today at 8 p.m.</p>\n<p>The talk, hosted by Walter H. Capps Center’s forum on Ethics and Public Policy, will focus on how legislation can address sexual assault and how institutions of higher learning use disciplinary codes to penalize perpetrators of sexual assault without holding them criminally liable. Jackson and Williams have both introduced legislation this year focusing on college administrations’ mechanisms for enforcing sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>Williams recently introduced several bills to the state assembly to combat sexual assault, including AB 967, which would extend perpetrator sentences to at least two years of suspension up to expulsion; AB 968, which would require academic transcripts to indicate if a student is ineligible to re-enroll; and AB 969, which would allow community colleges to suspend or expel perpetrators as well as require them to disclose information regarding their history of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, California universities are not doing enough to address sexual assault on campus.</p>\n<p>“More needs to be done to provide a safe and secure environment for our students at our higher education institutions,” Williams said in an email. “We must ensure that our campuses are investigating crimes, prosecuting perpetrators, and providing support and resources to victims.”</p>\n<p>Williams said there is a very low conviction rate for sexual assault cases because they require evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>“This [amount of hard evidence] is very difficult to achieve given the nature of the crime,” Williams said in an email. “There needs to be some consequences for committing sexual assault and my bills are attempting to make that easier to achieve.”</p>\n<p>Jackson recently introduced a bill titled SB-695, which would require high school health courses to include instruction on affirmative consent, sexual harassment, assault, violence and healthy relationships. According to Jackson, proactive sexual assault prevention starts with early education about healthy relationships and consent for both male and female students.</p>\n<p>“If we want to prevent sexual assault, it’s important that we start early,” Jackson stated in a press release. “This bill will ensure that discussions about healthy relationships and consent are taking place in high school.”</p>\n<p>Hannah Bartlebaugh, undergraduate assistant at the Capps Center and fourth-year political science and psychology double major, said she helped with media outreach for the event and hopes it will shed light on the public policy conversation in progress at a statewide level about sexual assault on campus.</p>\n<p>“I hope it brings greater light, not only to the issue … but also to what policy work is being done to address it,” Bartlebaugh said.</p>\n<p>Williams said he is speaking at Lotte Lehmann in order to help spark discussion about sexual assault on add campus and get students to advocate for policies that will combat and end sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“I hope we’ll have a productive conversation about how to change campus policies to make it easier for survivors of sexual assault to get justice and not have to continue going to school with their assailants,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>Gregory Jarrett from Walter H. Capps for the Study of Ethics, Religion, and Public Life and coordinator of the Sexual Assault on College Campuses event said that sexual violence on college campuses is not a new issue, but the public is paying attention to the issue now largely because of new acknowledgements made by political entities regarding sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“Campus Sexual violence is a very old problem, but only occasionally is it discussed outside of a few classrooms. It is currently back in the public eye, in part because the Department of Education and the Obama Administration have recognized the argument that this is not just a problem of isolated individuals,” Jarrett stated in an email. “It is also an assault on women, depriving women of an equal right to education under Title IX.”</p>\n<p>Jarrett also said college campuses have been unsuccessful in changing the situation of sexual violence on campus and the community has the opportunity to come together during this event with Williams and Jackson to create productive discourse surrounding the subject.<br>\n“The level of sexual violence against women on campus is a moral outrage. Universities appear to be unable to change the situation without outside support,” Jarrett said in an email. “This is an opportunity for all of us to come together in the spirit of community and openly discuss these issues, and hopefully come to a consensus to actually do something about it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/","id":2796,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[2795,2794,2793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVFP Reports Suicide Attempts, Theft, Prank Calls","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Last weekend yielded not too many occurrences thanks in part to Coachella, but included probation violations","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to a series of calls last weekend including theft, probation violation, three suicide attempts and a prank telephone call.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, a 46-year-old homeless man was stopped at Keg-N-Bottle just as he was about to step out of the store with a $40 bottle of Ketel One vodka under his jacket; he was arrested for shoplifting. His 22-page criminal history includes seven convictions for theft related offenses, including four cases of petty theft with a prior offense. All seven offenses involved time in custody and two were prison commitments.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies stopped a car because the occupants were not wearing their seatbelts while driving. During a consent search of the vehicle, deputies discovered hashish and a Vicodin pill in the car and a used hypodermic needle in the passenger’s pocket. The passenger is a self-admitted heroin addict and the driver, who was arrested for possession of the illegal substances, was on an “own recognizance release,” a written promise to appear at all court hearings, and on probation for burglary. Both were also charged with being under the influence of illegal substances.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, a subject threw themselves from the second story of their apartment building on the 800 block of Camino Lindo in an attempt to commit suicide. The subject, a UCSB student, was transported to a hospital and remains there in stable condition.</p>\n<p>According to law enforcement, Saturday night was relatively quiet, which officers credit to the popular Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival which draws many students out of town for the weekend.</p>\n<p>However, law enforcement dealt with another suicide scare this Saturday. IVFP received a call from a friend of the subject. The reporting party called from Ventura, stating that her friend, a Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student, was reportedly in the I.V. area and was distraught. The caller reported the friend having said, “I am going to take the ultimate sleep,” after which she immediately telephoned law enforcement. Deputies were dispatched to check the local beaches, ultimately unsuccessfully and an attempt was made to locate the subject’s iPhone. Shortly after, a GPS located the phone in Los Alamos. Further investigation found that the subject lived in Nipomo and, according to the caller, could have possibly been driving home. The subject’s parents were contacted and some 30 minutes later the subject arrived home. The parents stated their son seemed fine and were advised to call 9-1-1 if they suspected he needed any mental health or emergency assistance.</p>\n<p>On Sunday night, a student called to report his girlfriend had said she was going to kill herself. After confirming that threat was potentially plausible, units responded to her residence at 6600 block of Trigo to check on her welfare. However, they were unable to make contact, even after entry was made through an unsecured door. Further investigation and GPS cell phone locating revealed the woman was in the area of Veronica Springs Road near Elings Park in Santa Barbara, where one of her friends lives, according to the caller. Responding officers requested Goleta units check the area, along with the last known location of the phone; they were also provided with the subject’s vehicle description. All searches yielded negative results.</p>\n<p>Later on Sunday, a student called to say she and her sister received prank phone calls within an hour of each other. The student said her call was a partially pre-recorded computer voice intermixed with a live caller that was antagonistic. When she told the caller she was bored and was going to hang up, the caller became angry and cursed at her, calling her by name.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, the sister of the student said she was not threatened at all by the call and hung up after just a few seconds. It is suspected that the calls were related but no solid suspect could be determined and an investigation is ongoing.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Storke Plaza as a final event for their Armenian Genocide Centennial Commemoration Week.</p>\n<p>ASA held a weeklong event beginning this past Monday to educate students and the campus community about the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians beginning April 24, 1915, as well as the struggle for the Armenian community to receive United Nations recognition of the genocide years after the massacres occurred. During the Candlelight Vigil at Storke Plaza there will be a moment of silence to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe the fact that Obama is not accepting the Armenian genocide for what it was, which is a genocide, is honestly political cowardice. – Vice President of the Armenian Student Association Alexander Atamian</p></blockquote>\n<p>Vice President of the Armenian Student Association and third-year biology major Alexander Atamian described the event as a week of remembrance for the genocide, which he said occurred under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for eight years during the start of World War I.</p>\n<p>“Every year we have an Armenian Genocide commemoration week and it’s in order to remember the 1.5 million Armenians that were massacred in 1915 to 1923 by the Ottoman regime at the time,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>Atamian said U.S. Senators oftentimes only say they will acknowledge the 1915 massacres as a genocide in order to gain political support from the Armenian community, and then often do not completely follow through.</p>\n<p>“At this point I believe it’s just a political and strategic tactic that senators are using in order to get all of the Armenian votes because they know how strongly Armenians feel about the situation,” Atamian said. “I believe the fact that Obama is not accepting the Armenian genocide for what it was, which is a genocide, is honestly political cowardice.”</p>\n<p>According to Atamian, in order to prevent future genocides it is necessary for the global community to recognize all past genocides that have occurred, particularly the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“There are other genocides in the world that are happening every day and we need to step up morally and defend those who are being massacred,” Atamian said. “In order for there to not be future genocides we need to acknowledge and accept the ones that have occurred — the first one of the 20th century being the Armenian Genocide.”</p>\n<p>Atamian said ASA integrated other ethnic groups in their commemoration this year in acknowledgement that other groups were also massacred during the time of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“This year we did something different where we had a Assyrian individual approach us and asked us if we would also share their story as well in our commemoration, which we did … because during that time others were annihilated,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>According to Atamian, as a part of the Armenian Genocide commemoration week, ASA put up a miniature version of the Armenian Genocide Memorial across from Storke to represent the 12 provinces that belonged to Armenia before the genocide occurred.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The consensus of historians who study genocide say that what happened … in 1915, where a million-and-a-half people probably died, fits anybody’s definition of genocide. – Professor Paul Spickard</p></blockquote>\n<p>“[What] we started to do last year was put up the silver memorial along with the 12 slabs … it’s basically a miniature of the Armenian Genocide memorial that is in Yerevan, which is the capital of Armenia … the 12 slabs representing the 12 provinces that belonged to historical Armenia,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>Paul Spickard, a professor who focuses on 20th-century U.S. social and cultural history, said although some historians disagree, most historians have come to a consensus that admits the Armenian Genocide fits the definition of a “genocide.”</p>\n<p>“The consensus of historians who study genocide say that what happened … in 1915, where a million-and-a-half people probably died, fits anybody’s definition of genocide,” Spickard said. “That’s the consensus of historians but there are historians who disagree with that.”</p>\n<p>Spickard also said the Armenian Genocide fits the United Nations’ definition of genocide because it was a direct attempt to annihilate the Armenian population.</p>\n<p>“It was clearly ethnically directed and that’s one of the criteria for genocide,” Spickard said. “When the United Nations was founded they came up with a definition for genocide as an attack or attempt to destroy an entire ethnic group and it clearly was that.”</p>\n<p>According to Spickard, because the U.S. is an ally to Turkey and Turkey refuses to admit its past aggressions, the U.S. is in a difficult political situation in regard to identifying the 1915 massacre as a genocide.</p>\n<p>“Turkey is part of NATO, Turkey is one of the major players in Middle-Eastern politics and … of those players they are the only one with a democracy. So they are an ally,” Spickard said. “The United States really needs Turkey to be a strong counterbalance to Iran … [and] Turkey doesn’t want to face their reality.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year cultural anthropology major and member of cultural sorority Alpha Gamma Alpha Vicki Deirboghossian said many people outside of the Armenian community participated in the event “Handprint Against Genocide” on this past Tuesday to show their support for students advocated for Armenian genocide recognition.</p>\n<p>“At Handprints Against Genocide … from what I observed a lot of people that weren’t Armenian or weren’t associated [with ASA] actually did participate,” Deirboghossian said.</p>\n<p>Deirboghossian said it is rewarding to see others at the university care about the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“It’s cool to see, being at a primarily white multicultural university and finding that people actually do care, it’s very rewarding,” Deirboghossian said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Katrine Lalaian said it is important for students to be aware of the Armenian Genocide because after a century many people do not know it even occurred.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really important thing … since it’s our centennial and a lot of people don’t even know what it is,” Lalaian said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-62679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista and university stakeholders are exploring new methods to cope with current drought conditions given California Governor Jerry Brown’s state-mandated water restrictions issued earlier this month.</p>\n<p>State regulators discussed Brown’s water reduction rules this past Saturday, which cut urban potable water use by 25 percent statewide. According to a California State Water Boards press release, on March 17 the State Water Resources Control Board adopted emergency regulations that apply to all California residents, prohibiting runoff irrigation to non-irrigated areas, driveway and sidewalk washing and hose use without shutoff nozzles to wash vehicles. In addition, restaurants and other food service establishments have been mandated to only serve water to customers on request.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sustainability Recycling and Water Efficiency manager Matthew O’Carroll said the Goleta Water District has robust water conservation programs and relatively low per-capita water use in comparison to other water districts. According to O’Carroll, further water reductions at the university will require higher expenditures.</p>\n<p>“UCSB’s biggest challenge is achieving further potable water reductions,” O’Carroll said in an email. “Just last year, we reduced our potable water consumption 21% compared to the previous year and we are at a point now where we have picked a lot of the ‘low-hanging fruit.’ So future strategies that yield significant potable water savings will also have large upfront costs.”</p>\n<p>According to O’Carroll, while reduction in potable water consumption is a top priority, water conservation for landscape maintenance is less of a priority due to the university’s use of recycled water.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is fortunate enough to have recycled water, a source of water that is of lesser quality than potable/drinking water, but which can be used for certain applications such as irrigation,” O’Carroll said. “Ninety percent of our campus is irrigated with recycled water, and to be honest, if we didn’t have this source, landscape and irrigation could possibly be our largest area of potable water consumption.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks Department (IVRPD) general manager Rodney Gould said that while recycled water is beneficial to the university in water conservation, it is inaccessible in Isla Vista due to lack of funds.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately the distribution lines for recycled water stop at UCSB and don’t reach Isla Vista,” Gould said. “We asked Goleta Water District if they would extend the pipes but they indicated they don’t have the funds to do so. If we can find the funding for the infrastructure, they would provide the water.”</p>\n<p>According to Gould, while IVRPD has made significant cuts in water consumption in the past few years, more conservation efforts will be necessary with potentially increasing rates based on a Stage 3 surcharge.</p>\n<p>“With proposed changes in Goleta Water District’s billing structure, the District could potentially experience a $38,000 annual rate increase,” Gould said. “We’ve been watching our water usage very carefully and on average have cut back by 25 percent as compared to the 2012-2013 fiscal year. We’re also in the process of auditing the irrigation in all of our parks looking for leaks, and calculating usage in specific areas.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Food Co-op produce manager Rebekah Miles said local produce suppliers have been hit the hardest, while the Co-op itself has not been greatly affected by the water shortages.<br>\n“For example, we usually have a constant supply of local avocados, but this is the first time in the four-and-a-half years I’ve been here that we’ve had a three month gap in avocado supply,” Miles said.</p>\n<p>Miles also said in addition to water shortage, farmers have been dealing with various pests that are especially prevalent during droughts, such as the bagrada bug that feasts on brassica, a certain leafy green produce.</p>\n<p>“Brassicas include cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower and various other leafy greens, all of which we carry at the Co-op,” Miles said. “Organics do not use pesticides, so these bugs are really causing problems especially in dry conditions.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said members of the UCSB Bren School formed the Water Action Plan in 2013 after the university surpassed the 20 percent potable water use reduction goal by 2020 mandated by UC Office of the President. According to O’Carroll, developing the Water Action Plan helped identify the major consumers of potable water on campus, which are bathrooms and labs, primarily in academic buildings and residence halls.</p>\n<p>“The majority of our potable water consumption is in academic buildings and in residential housing,” O’Carroll said. “In academic buildings we are looking at more efficient water fixtures in both bathrooms and the lab setting.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said in addition to short-term modifications to conserve water, such as bathroom retrofitting, educational campaigns are also a part of Housing and Residential Services water conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>“Housing and Residential Services has continued their commitment to conserving water and has continued to outfit the residence halls with efficient fixtures and also have a very robust education and outreach program,” O’Carroll said.</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) co-chairs third-year biology major Heather Vest and third-year environmental studies major Jennifer Suh said in a joint statement that changing personal eating habits is one of the most difficult parts about conserving water.</p>\n<p>“One method to reduce is cutting down on water-intensive food choices such as almonds, meat and walnuts, which use a hearty supply of water to produce,” Vest and Suh said in an email. “So much of California’s water usage is agricultural, so it’s important to consume less.”</p>\n<p>According to Vest and Suh, water conservation is most significant at the individual level.</p>\n<p>“As students at UCSB, we often find it difficult to see any effects on our lives personally because with the ways we live, we don’t pay for our water sources within campus and/or Isla Vista housing, so many students do not see the need to decrease our water usage,” Vest and Suh said. “But we need to make choices every day that show we are conscious of the situation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/","id":4724,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[4723,4722,4721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Covers Deltopia Stats, Food Bank, UCen","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Paris-Cullen-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Paris-Cullen-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Associated Students Senate met last night in the UCen’s Flying “A” Room to discuss Deltopia crime statistics, A.S.

Food Bank funding and events to commemorate the anniversary of the May 23rd tragedy.</p>\n<p>During yesterday’s meeting Senators passed a “Bill to Re-Envision the Role of the Internal Vice President” and sent “A Resolution to Support the Mental Health Services Act,” “A Bill to Update Policy 37 Media and Publicity,” “A Bill to Define the Special Elections Process for Spring 2015,” “A Resolution in Support of A.S. Food Bank as a Food Center” and “A Bill to Update the Eligibility of EOP Grants” for review by the University Affairs Committee.  The senators also introduced several administrative bills and resolutions regarding A.S. Legal Code, sending them to committee for review.</p>\n<p>UCPD Lt. Mark Signa updated the senators on Deltopia crime statistics and said there were 206 citations issued and 145 arrests made during the festivities. Thirty-five of those arrested were UCSB students, 15 were SBCC students and 95 were unaffiliated with either school.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, although the number of arrests was “moderately high,” a reduction in medical emergencies and violence proved to be a positive change from last year’s Deltopia. Signa said the success of this year’s Deltopia occurred due to the concerted effort of students and community members to host alternative events and keep it local.</p>\n<p>“The only thing I contribute success to is actually not law enforcement, but student efforts and the community and people coming together to make this a successful event,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa also said UCPD aims to reduce the number of officers deployed during Deltopia in the future, but that any reduction would be based on circumstances.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s the general goal of all of this: to reduce the number of officers,” Signa said. “This year we had about 220 officers throughout the day … I think that’s definitely something we can look into reducing.”</p>\n<p>Zach Goulhiane, UCen Governance Board member, Senator and third-year chemistry and political science double major, told the Senate that Kaplan Inc.’s lease on their space in the UCen is ending soon and UCen administrators are weighing their options for how to use the space.</p>\n<p>“Their contract ends in October 2016 so they’re trying to decide whether to use that space as still Kaplan or have someone else rent that spot,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank Student Chair Katie Freeze, Vice Chair Erick Lankey and Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen  gave a presentation to the Senate to encourage the Senate to pass “A Resolution in Support of the AS Food Bank as a Food Center,” which seeks funding to expand the Food Bank’s services.</p>\n<p>“The idea we came up with is expansion of educational programs, such as conference outreach,” Freeze said. “And ideally we want a community food center and a demonstrations kitchen where students can go if they don’t have access to a kitchen.”</p>\n<p>According to Lankey, the campus’ grant of $75,000 for the A.S. Food Bank from UC Global Food Initiative and UC Office of the President (UCOP) ends in 2016, and the organization’s fee initiative ends in 2017. Thus, to continue servicing the volume of students that use the Food Bank, the organization will need additional funding, Lankey said.</p>\n<p>“We are going to need additional funding, ideally from the campus, to give us a base of $150,000,” Lankey said. “The idea is that we have $75,000 from lock-in and then a match of $75,000 to be provided.”</p>\n<p>Lankey said the food bank currently services about 2,500 students and is projected to serve 3,000 students by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>According to Freeze, receiving additional funding will help the food bank improve their services and thus work toward their goal to reduce the number of food bank-reliant students.</p>\n<p>“We’ll be able to provide higher quality food for our students in the long run,” Freeze said. “More culturally-appropriate food at our bank as well.”</p>\n<p>Freeze also said the A.S. Food Bank is collaborating with other campus organizations for the Edible Campus Project, an endeavor started by alumnus and musician Jack Johnson and his wife Kim that aims to eliminate local food insecurity, co-led by the Food Bank, the A.S. Department of Public Worms and UCSB Sustainability.</p>\n<p>“Another thing we’re looking to do is to increase food production,” Freeze said. “We are in partnership with the Department of Worms and UC Sustainability to start on-campus gardens.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Community Adviser Diana Collins Puente discussed the upcoming two-week campaign for the anniversary of the May 23rd Isla Vista tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Many efforts are underway at UCSB and Isla Vista to commemorate the anniversary and give the community the spaces in which to come together in healing,” Puente said.</p>\n<p>Events will include a candle light vigil, a march to Del Playa, a paddle out held by the Surf Club, the opening of Isla Vista’s Love and Remembrance Garden and the lighting project, amongst others.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/","id":2800,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2799,2798,2797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

According to Weiss, approximately $32,000 has been committed by community organizations to support these costs.</p>\n<p>“There are a number of commitments that have been made either in writing or verbally for paying for the study,” Weiss said. “That includes individuals and some major entities like UCSB and City College.”</p>\n<p>Even with enough money, the financial feasibility study would still require several months of collecting and analyzing information to complete, according to Weiss.</p>\n<p>“By the time we press go, sign a contract and have it start, what I understand is two to three months will then be needed to gather all this data and crunch it,” Weiss said. “At this point I don’t even know when a start date will be.”</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, Community Organizer from the Office of Das Williams, said her existing relationships with local agencies can speed the data collection process.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the time it takes for the study is gathering information and reaching out to agencies and all that stuff to get numbers,” Elliott said. “Since I already have relationships with all those agencies, I have a lot of that information that I can send to them that will help speed it along.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud, online crowdfunding is another source of revenue that could help pay for the feasibility study.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said fundraising can be done through the I.V. Community Relations Committee as well.</p>\n<p>“We would probably be open to it,” Schunk said. “We could do micro-donations.”</p>\n<p>Participants plan to discuss the boundaries that could potentially be under the administration of a local government in I.V. at next week’s stakeholders’ meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/","id":4723,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4722,4721,4720],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":120,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
