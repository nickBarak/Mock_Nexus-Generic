Bearman also held a Q&amp;A session and signed copies of his most recent book, Drugs Are NOT the Devil’s Tools.  Bearman was a key founder of the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic in 1970 and Director of Medical Services for the Santa Barbara Regional Health Authority (SBRHA) for 17 years.</p>\n<p>Bearman began with a 45-minute lecture on the history of  drug consumption,  beginning with Zoroastrian rituals and ending with GW Pharmaceuticals’ 2014 medical trials of Epidiolex, a liquid form of Cannabidiol used to treat epilepsy.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the history of cannabis use can help people understand modern policy and culture surrounding the drug.</p>\n<p>“The reason that history is important is it helps explain why we have this peculiar attitude towards this substance that has a tremendous amount of healing potential,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>According to Bearman, drug policy in the past has discriminated against African-American, Latino, Chinese, Native American and Irish minority groups, as well as many others.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the word “witch-hunt” stems from Pope Innocent VIII’s Summis desiderantes affectibus in 1484. According to Bearman, the issuance sought to punish midwives (witches) for their use of cannabis to dull childbirth pains, since Church doctrine viewed this practice as heretical.</p>\n<p>“One of the first groups that was discriminated against was where we get the word ‘witch-hunt’ from,” Bearman said. “Witches were midwives and used cannabis to ease the pain of childbirth.”</p>\n<p>Bearman later said hemp was the “oil of the 16th century” due to its use in trans-Atlantic ships’ “sails and rigging,” including those used in the slave trade.<br>\n“Those boats were used for the triangular trade, both sugar, rum and slavery,” said Bearman.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the Founding Fathers, including George Washington, were especially fond of hemp and grew the plant.</p>\n<p>“Washington wrote in his diary that he so hoped he’d get home in time for the hemp harvest since he so particularly enjoyed being there for the burning of the slag,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>After providing a broad history of drug use, Bearman shifted his focus to the history of cannabis in Western medicine, crediting Dr. Brooke O’Shaughnessy with first reintroducing cannabis to the Western world.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Brooke O’Shaughnessy had been in India, where they’d been using cannabis for at least 3,000 years,” Bearman said. “They’re still using cannabis in India, at least by the poor, as a medicine.”</p>\n<p>After O’Shaughnessy reintroduced cannabis to western medicine, it quickly gained broad popularity with almost 2.5 million doctor’s prescriptions filled in 1928.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the wide use of cannabis as a legal medicine quickly changed due to policies enacted in 1930 by commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics Harry J. Anslinger, serving cotton and nylon corporations’ interests.</p>\n<p>“He was the greatest bureaucrat of all time because he created a problem where it didn’t exist and thus increased his bureaucracy,” Bearman said. “The effort had really nothing to do with marginalizing marijuana — they were aimed at marginalizing hemp.”</p>\n<p>Bearman ended by discussing contemporary medical studies on cannabis and the endocannabinoid system as well as discussing what he calls the “New Paradigm” — the viewpoint that substance abuse should be treated as a medical condition instead of through the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>“The first modern research on cannabis was having to do with seizures in 1949,” Bearman said. “Cannabis is immensely helpful for cancer patients and in fact it may kill cancer cells.”</p>\n<p>Bearman answered a range of questions, including how cannabis affects driving, “big tobacco’s” possible future role in cannabis production and how a change in drug scheduling would affect cannabis research.</p>\n<p>“What the Department of Transportation says is there’s no relationship between impairment and the level of THC,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the role of “big tobacco” in marijuana legalization would have a negative effect.</p>\n<p>“I think the odds are 100 percent and it’s bad,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Jarryd Wafer said he enjoyed the talk and was very interested in cannabis’s potential to treat his type I diabetes.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was great learning about the histories associated, where we’re at today and where we’re going with cannabis,” Wafer said.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Tara Cseresynyac, who works as Dr. Bearman’s personal assistant, said she was happy about the turnout and is looking forward to future lectures.</p>\n<p>“I was impressed by the turn out; I thought there was a great variety of people,” Cseresynyac said. “There were students, professionals — a huge variety of people.”</p>\n<p>In an interview following the lecture, Bearman said he would be open to giving another talk on campus and said he would like to see broader teaching of the endocannabinoid system at universities.</p>\n<p>“I was very pleased with the turnout. I think people were interested — people stuck around, asked good questions and were interested in the information,” Bearman said. “I’d like to see UCSB have a course on the endocannabinoid system.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/","id":2633,"author":{"id":133,"name":"Duncan Calvert"},"related":[2632,2631,2630],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic Building to discuss what public safety services an I.V. Community Service District (CSD) could provide if created in the November 2016 county election.</p>\n<p>Discussion focused on Halloween and options for local law enforcement under a CSD. Tuesday’s meeting was the third in a series of 11 weekly meetings the Initiative has organized for I.V. stakeholders to discuss the specific framework of an I.V. CSD. As stipulated in Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3, an I.V. CSD would have the ability to contract additional law enforcement from the County of Santa Barbara, and the University of California could supplement current law enforcement.</p>\n<p>This Halloween weekend, I.V. Foot Patrol and the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) used the same tactics as in past Halloween and Deltopia events, focusing on increased law enforcement, medics, first aid, fire and search and rescue, according to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino.</p>\n<p>Plastino said most of these services were used minimally or not at all due to small crowds, and said the same amount of resources may not be necessary for future Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>“As things mellow out in Isla Vista, we can continue to reduce our presence during major events like that because they’re not so major any longer,” Plastino said. “There certainly isn’t a threat to the public, so you can scale back law enforcement when that occurs.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he was worried about the large police presence intimidating some people, but the overall response from I.V. residents was positive.</p>\n<p>“I was concerned that up-staffing of law enforcement might be negative to some people,” Plastino said. “I was very mindful of that, but that wasn’t what we heard out on the street. It was a good feeling.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Police Department Lieutenant Mark Signa said law enforcement was “toned down” this year and campus events such as Delirium helped to make this year safer than past Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>“All these things came together,” Signa said.  “Our biggest issue of the weekend was trying to get students into the concert. You really couldn’t ask for a better problem than that.”</p>\n<p>Signa said the UCIV, a program coordinating volunteers to mediate between law enforcement and I.V. partygoers, was successful during Halloween weekend and should operate more often.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’ll be into further talks about extending UCIV into a yearlong program that’s not for just major events,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa said although he supports the program, he is concerned about a partnership with UCIV and the local law enforcement creating a “stigma” against UCIV volunteers.</p>\n<p>“My major issue with being too involved with law enforcement in the program is attaching that vibe to it — and then you start losing some of the effectiveness with students,” Signa said. “I want us to be involved as much as possible in the training and the encouragement and support, but at the same time still have that independence.”</p>\n<p>According to vice president of the I.V. Downtown Business Association Jay Freeman, the lack of visitors on Halloween hurt local businesses by detracting from their usual crowds.</p>\n<p>“There needs to be some way of thinking about the problem of the events in the area that’s not ‘let’s just totally shut down the existence of events,’” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said some I.V. residents are interested in a sobering center where I.V. partygoers can go as an alternative to jail. The center would include an alcohol and drug education program.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and third year public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said I.V.

Halloweens, during which videos of rowdy street parties, car wrecks and police riots emerged on social media. UC Berkeley students and administrators attribute the rowdy crowds to both Halloween and the UC Berkeley vs. University of Southern California (USC) football game at Memorial Stadium on Saturday.</p>\n<p>With the absence of signature Halloween festivities in I.V., which were replaced by university-sponsored concerts and events and the emergence of Berkeley as a new hotspot, students are questioning if UCSB lives up to its status as a Halloween destination and its Princeton Review ranking of sixth best party school in the nation.</p>\n<p>Communications Manager for Student Affairs at UC Berkeley Adam Michael Ratliff said campus law enforcement is still investigating the cause of the parties and rioting.</p>\n<p>“Student Affairs leaders are planning to gather the facts about this weekend’s incident to better understand what occurred, who was involved,” Ratliff said in an email. “They will continue to work with all of our various student organizations to promote safe events for the Berkeley community.”</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley Police Department Lieutenant Marc DeCoulode said the presence of USC students at the football game and tailgating may have contributed to the rowdy crowds in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>“I think what contributed to it was that Halloween fell on a Saturday, which doesn’t happen really often and the fact that we had the USC football game so there was some extra people along fraternity row,” DeCoulode said. “Both some of our people and USC people [were] outside, so it was a little more crowded than usual.”</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley student and second-year environmental economics and public policy major Alyssa Nguyen said last year’s Halloween weekend ended early in the evening due to stricter law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“This year I think [police] were more lenient; this year it seems that the parties were shut down later than last year,” Nguyen said. “Last year, there were a lot of incidents of college student deaths in parties. The parties were dead silent at 10 p.m. to 11p.m., and all the parties were not big. It wasn’t like anything where everyone was allowed in and having fun.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said party-goers on Channing Way playing loud music and vandalizing cars were later constrained by Berkeley police department at the scene.</p>\n<p>“I heard that there was an individual’s party so crazy they brought it out to the streets. Everyone was jumping on a car, and dancing on the car,” Nguyen said. “Apparently a guy dressed up as Jesus was also dancing on the car and everyone was yelling ‘Jesus! Jesus!’ But the windows cracked and everything. The police pretty much blockaded everyone inside on the street.”</p>\n<p>Berkeley resident Nina Krishnan said the weekend was an outlier compared to what typically happens in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>“The last Halloween at Cal was on a Friday, and it was quite disappointing. I can definitely say compared to last year, there were far more people on the streets at Berkeley — especially Frat Row,” Krishnan said “More people, bigger crowds — it was lit. It was definitely lit on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Krishnan said she witnessed a street party that escalated into car vandalism and then chaotic running from the center of the party. Krishnan said she did not witness any police or security at the scene and didn’t know what motivated people to run.</p>\n<p>“It was more of a general party on the street at first. It wasn’t dangerous or violent — it wasn’t a riot — that’s not what I would call the first part. But then something snapped — in a flash, things got very messy as people started smashing cars and jumping on cars,” Krishnan said. “They definitely cracked the window and windshield and then in a few minutes, there was straight-out mayhem. People started running in all directions.”</p>\n<p>The unprecedented Halloween party scene in Berkeley drew a sharp contrast to the quieter-than-ever weekend in I.V.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Sheriff Department Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said based on low turnout this Halloween, UCSB students are beginning to realize the danger of inviting out-of-towners and having open-door policies for parties.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had huge crowds for Halloween especially, on a weekend. We were prepared for a large turnout; however, the last several years we’ve noticed a significant decrease every year in turnout for Halloween,” Hoover said. “The fact that there is heavy law enforcement, there was no music, parking was very strict and the students aren’t inviting out-of-towners — we are seeing it reflect in the number.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies and Chican@ studies double-major Carmen Mares said her freshman year Halloween weekend was surrounded by “negative vibes” due to many out-of-towner-induced safety concerns.</p>\n<p>“DP was filled with people. Everybody dressed up, some people getting a little too crazy. We’d walk a block, and in the next block, there are, like, cops having to get people on the sidewalk because they were too drunk,” Mares said. “It was intense because it was a playground for a lot of people to come.”</p>\n<p>Mares said she enjoyed her Halloween weekend this year because of the safety and the lack of worry over out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>“Halloween in I.V. was really exciting in the sense that we’re all dressed up, we all have fun and we don’t have to worry about school for a couple of days. Even if you’re not partying and you’re just walking down the streets in I.V., everybody’s just happy,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President and fourth-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian also said Halloween this year was significantly different from her freshman year.</p>\n<p>“The first year there was crazy amounts of people, and I think it is the last year before there was super enforcement of police,” Hashemian said. “[This year] there were more volunteers out there than actual people, which shows, like, how great of a job to keep this a local event.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Jorge Escobar said due to I.V.’s party reputation, many police and security resources are assigned to I.V. during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“Every UC sends a certain amount of allocation of cops to Santa Barbara because they know a certain percentage of their school population will come to Santa Barbara,” Escobar said “That’s why you would see things like ‘UCLA Campus Police’ here in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said she hopes I.V. can reduce police presence in the future if Halloween continues to be a local event.</p>\n<p>“I loved what happened, and I guess it’s one year but if it happens in four or five years, then it becomes a trend,” Hashemian said. “Hopefully we can spend less money on cops coming here and also changing the culture, which is what we really need.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said she noticed fewer out-of-towners and more community bonding despite heavy law enforcement within the area.</p>\n<p>“I was walking on Del Playa and I saw the police playing Frisbee with students; I saw students taking pictures with the police, chatting with the police,” Armistead said. “But you can tell they were from the area because they weren’t looking to trash the place, they were just looking to be with their community.”<br>\nAccording to Krishnan, this Halloween weekend doesn’t reflect the culture and reputation of UC Berkeley as a university and the community of Berkeley.</p>\n<p>“I personally don’t think you would go to Berkeley for the parties,” Krishnan said. “There are other things that were far more memorable at Berkeley than the parties, such as the food, culture [and] people. That’s the vibe you get from the city.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said this weekend doesn’t change or increase Berkeley’s party reputation because they typically experience the same amount of parties as other colleges in the nation.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we’re known to be work hard, play really hard. I think for [party] reputation, we don’t really have a matter of say in it,” Nguyen said. “I think for us we don’t care about the reputation — I have a feeling that it’s just Berkeley always has something going on every weekend where we really enjoy ourselves.”<br>\nHashemian said she is glad UCSB is losing its party school reputation.</p>\n<p>“It’s unfortunate that Berkeley had an insane [Halloween weekend], but insane as in having 3,000 people when, like, we have 16,000. I’m glad that we’re losing that reputation because it’s a reputation that doesn’t really represent us.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said UCSB’s party reputation is irrelevant compared to the university’s quality of education and on-campus diversity.</p>\n<p>“I think, ultimately, our reputation defines the quality of our degree,” Armistead said. “I think bringing Halloween down to a manageable fun time is the best thing for our community and education.”</p>\n<p>Mares said UCSB’s party reputation will not change just because this year’s Halloween was safer and more local.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it has that big of an impact in our SB party scene or reputation because people still party. It’s just for that specific event nobody wants that to happen. Nobody wants riots or [to feel] unsafe,” Mares said. “I think it was a community agreement — ‘Okay, we’re a party school — we party all the time. But hey, this is our school. A lot of the locals want to feel safe. We still party but we’ll party in a different way.’”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang said the university’s efforts to preserve I.V. have been effectual.</p>\n<p>“As evidenced by the calm Halloween weekend, our combined efforts are making a cultural change in Isla Vista and helping to create a surrounding community that complements the preeminent academic stature of our university,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 and 4 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66162\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66162\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/","id":3603,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[3602,3601,3600],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LGBTQ Studies To Revitalize its Minor","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Department of Feminist Studies plans to expand the LGBTQ Minor by adding three new classes; two in Winter quarter and one during Spring New Director of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>The Department of Feminist Studies plans to expand the LGBTQ Minor by adding three new classes; two in Winter quarter and one during Spring</h2>\n<p>New Director of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) studies minor and assistant professor Jennifer Tyburczy plans to revitalize the Department of Feminist Studies’ LGBTQ minor, which has been offered since 2004.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy aims to offer students a comprehensive background in new LGBTQ theories as well as the global history of LGBTQ studies. The minor currently provides an interdisciplinary examination of the lives, experiences, identities and representations of LGBTQ individuals. Students seeking the LGBTQ studies minor will take feminist studies courses in addition to a variety of interdisciplinary courses.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy said she wants the minor to connect with social issues from around the world and focus on LGBTQ developments within the UCSB student population.</p>\n<p>“Top priorities will include strengthening the intersections of gender and sexuality studies with race, ethnicity, class, and disability studies from a national and transnational lens, forging new social justice and scholarly ties across disciplines,” Tyburczy said in an email.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy said the minor is expanding with two new courses being offered during next Winter quarter and one new course during Spring quarter.</p>\n<p>“I will offer two new courses this winter: an upper-division undergraduate course called ‘Trans-Art’ that will explore transgender, genderqueer, and gender fluid artists and artworks across genres and geographies in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and a queer theory graduate course,” Tyburczy said in email. “In the spring, I will offer an undergraduate version of queer theory.”</p>\n<p>According to Tyburczy, the minor will be tailored to better prepare the student body for future careers in a variety of fields.</p>\n<p>“Students will gain broad knowledge in a growing segment of the national and global population that remains little understood by mainstream institutions,” Tyburczy said in email. “This knowledge can be employed in a variety of arenas: from activism and public advocacy work, to the law and the health sciences, to the arts and educational environments.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication major Ciara Baker, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, said the LGBTQ studies minor educates students on global issues concerning sexuality, gender and identities and understanding systematic marginalization through critical thinking.</p>\n<p>“I think the minor is important because it produces well-rounded students because of the intersectionality it covers and it also makes students more aware, so that they can be more inclusive and successful in any career that they choose,” Baker said in an email. “The LGBTQ minor allows UCSB students to broaden their field of study and understand race, gender, and other identities.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Madeline Stefani said she is pursuing the minor because it focuses on viewing “gender rigidity” as one of the main causes of inequality.</p>\n<p>“I think that it covers important movements in our history as humans that are not covered anywhere else and gives students the opportunity to explore social issues, especially ones relating to the LGBTQ community,” Stefani said in an email. “It’s another area of marginalization that is not really discussed in the history courses. I think it should be just as important as an ethnicity requirement.”</p>\n<p>Feminist studies professor Leila Rupp said many students pursue the minor to better understand the identities of their loved ones.</p>\n<p>“Some students do the minor for personal reasons, either because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer or have family members who are and want to understand the place of sexuality, in combination with other factors, in shaping life experiences,” Rupp said in an email.</p>\n<p>Rupp said students also enter the program to better recognize the problems of LGBTQ members in intellectual and career-oriented domains.</p>\n<p>“Some students pursue the minor for professional reasons, so that in their chosen careers they understand the lives, experiences, and identities of LGBTQ people,” Rupp said in an email. “And still others do the minor for primarily intellectual reasons, because they find the subject matter compelling.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story

of Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), an international organization advocating an end to the “war on drugs” approach to substance control.</p>\n<p>Garcia, a second-year biology major, and Minoiefar, a third-year history of public policy major, aim to educate students on the war on drugs, explore alternative approaches and promote smart decisions regarding drug use. A group of students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst led by Shea Gunther founded SSDP in 1998, and the organization has grown to include thousands of members from hundreds of campuses worldwide.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s SSDP chapter is currently going through the campus organization registration process with the Office of Student life and seeking a faculty advisor, but has already been active on campus and has a club constitution. For a chapter to be officially recognized by the organization, it must have at least three students and actively organize on campus.</p>\n<p>Pacific outreach coordinator for SSDP Frances Fu said she can help connect SSDP efforts across campuses.</p>\n<p>“For example, the UC Davis chapter is currently spearheading a Good Samaritan policy at their school and would like to make it a statewide effort,” Fu said in an email. “Part of my job is facilitating those relationships and partnerships.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said he hopes to help install a local Good Samaritan policy, which would grant legal immunity to someone who calls the police or medical personnel for an injured person.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times a person’s friends or peers are scared of law enforcement and the repercussions that would come with calling an ambulance and getting the authorities involved,” Garcia said. “We’d like to make it easier for people who need help with drugs and alcohol to seek help for something like an overdose.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said he hopes to convey to students the many effects of national and local drug policy.</p>\n<p>“I’d like for SSDP to educate students on how drug policy is related to a variety of other social issues, like unemployment and the economy, education, health care and racial injustice,” Garcia said. “If students understand how reforming drug policy will improve society in these other areas, then they will understand how necessary drug policy reform actually is.”</p>\n<p>To publicize the new chapter, members have been tabling and handing out information around campus. Garcia plans to eventually hold documentary screenings and invite guest speakers to campus to discuss drug policy.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Catherine Lee says that SSDP will be a good addition to UCSB’s campus organizations because many students do not understand the implications of drug policy and the effects of drug use.</p>\n<p>“It sounds similar to what we learned in AlcoholEdu online over the summer, but I think this program will be more successful in communicating messages to students if they do everything in person through things like guest speakers and events,” Lee said. “Unfortunately, I don’t think most students registered most of the information presented to them online in AlcoholEdu.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said he decided to create the UCSB chapter of SSDP because he felt not having a local Good Samaritan policy discourages students from aiding others in in dangerous situations to avoid legal repercussions.</p>\n<p>Like Garcia, Minoiefar said he would like to change local policy to encourage students to intervene in potentially dangerous situations.</p>\n<p>“A big thing the chapter can do is push a policy like the Good Samaritan policy at the university,” Minoiefar said. “The school can put in its policy that if you get help for someone in need … and if it is decided that a person did it in good faith, they won’t be in trouble.”</p>\n<p>As the new chapter of SSDP grows at UCSB, Minoiefar said he hopes to amass a big enough following to continue running the program once both co-founders graduate.</p>\n<p>“These types of initiatives, like the Good Samaritan policy, tend to die out when a student like me leaves because then all the information and things I’ve learned leave with me,” Minoiefar said. “By building this chapter, we hope to be able to create new student leaders who can continue this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66175\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66175\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/","id":2637,"author":{"id":140,"name":"Olivia Pla"},"related":[2636,2635,2634],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Board Considers Solution to I.V.

The IVMP mandates regular street parking surveys and stipulates that if the survey finds a parking vacancy rate below 15 percent for three consecutive UCSB academic quarters, the county will implement a permit parking program to bring parking vacancy rates back above the 15 percent mark. Many I.V. residents take issue with the 2013 survey findings, claiming I.V. parking is more impacted than the survey suggested and requires a more immediate solution. The Commission ultimately voted to recommend IVMP’s existing decision to continue surveys before implementing a permit program.</p>\n<p>Deputy Director of Long Range Planning Division Matt Schneider said parking surveys, conducted by Fehr and Peers Transportation Consultants, help monitor parking vacancy rates.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The purpose of the parking survey … is to monitor the vacancy rate, with 15 percent vacancy rate being the tipping point,” Schneider said. “Based on the current data we have available, we are below that threshold. There certainly will be a need once we cross that to develop a more robust parking program.”</p>\n<p>Planning Commission member Daniel Blough said a parking survey is not necessary, as parking in I.V. is clearly impacted.</p>\n<p>“On that one issue I just can’t see wasting the money or the time,” Blough said. “I don’t need a survey to tell me there is a problem.”</p>\n<p>Planning Commission member Joan Hartmann said parking surveys should monitor parking until results “trigger” a program.</p>\n<p>“It may be that we already have a strong sense that there is not enough parking, that it has already met the trigger since that survey was done in 2013, but I think we need ongoing surveys to see if there is change,” Hartmann said. “It is mrely a monitoring program and if we have other strategies to deal with parking, then we would like to see those changes on the ground.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said UCSB faculty and staff parking may be impacting I.V. due to insufficient on-campus parking, meaning improved UCSB parking could help I.V.</p>\n<p>“Maybe there are other things in addition to the parking permit program that we can be working on,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees member and UCSB alum Jonathan Abboud said I.V. should have a way to locally oversee the proposed permit program.<br>\n“I personally would support moving the plan forward now, but we should have an Area Planning Commission in Isla Vista in the future to oversee the implementation of the plan to make it more community-reflective and more community-based,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students College of Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said I.V. needs an effective parking solution because many students depend on cars for transportation.</p>\n<p>“Oftentimes, it is dismissed that students need cars, but oftentimes it is very vital that they have them, so adequate parking really needs to be considered,” Minoiefar said. “The landlords’ use of high parking fees for their parking spots is an issue.”</p>\n<p>The Commission will send its recommendations to the Board of Supervisors, which will consider the revised IVMP this winter. If the Board adopts the updates, it will submit the IVMP to the California Coastal Commission in Santa Barbara County in Spring 2016.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/","id":4626,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4625,4624,4623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Award-Winning Writer Graces Campbell Hall to Speak on Chilean Mining Accident","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tobar_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tobar_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Héctor Tobar lectured on his recent book, Deep Down Dark, Monday night at Campbell Hall in an event hosted by UCSB Arts & Lectures.

Tobar was the only journalist the miners granted permission to record the story.</p>\n<p>In an interview preceding the lecture, Tobar said coming from an immigrant, Latino family, he felt like an “outsider” in higher education, which he believes ultimately “served him well” as a journalist and author.</p>\n<p>“I always felt like I didn’t get a great education and I was with all these people who had been really well educated,” Tobar said. “It turned out that those qualities that you have as someone who is an outsider and someone who is maybe more humble, those are great qualities to have when you’re a journalist, because it breaks down the barrier between you and the person you’re interviewing.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said one miner he interviewed said he reflected back on pivotal moments of his life in the moments leading up to his ultimate rescue.</p>\n<p>“One of the men told me ‘As I was going up [the capsule], I saw my life flash before my eyes. I remembered things that happened since I was young; I remembered when I met my wife; I remembered when our kids were born; I remembered when I got married,’” Tobar said.</p>\n<p>According to Tobar, the experience of longing to return home and ultimately escaping the mine was like “rebirth” for the 33 miners.</p>\n<p>“What it became for me was a story about men who want to return home,” Tobar said. “They want to be reborn into the lives they had before, they want to go back home to the routines of family.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said interviewing the miners and understanding what they valued amid the mine cave-in caused him to reflect on his own life.</p>\n<p>“In being trapped, in seeing their own deaths, in that time they have to think, they realize that the best thing about them was all the love they brought into the world and all the love that surrounded them,” Tobar said. “That’s what I’ve learned, and as a result of this project I think I value even more my own life.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said despite his accomplishments as a journalist and author, his greatest pride comes from his family.</p>\n<p>“I have many great things that have happened in my life, but the thing that I am most proud of, the best thing about me is that I’ve been married for 22 years and am a father of three kids.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said family is an “extremely powerful force” during challenges times such as the months the 33 miners spent trapped below ground.</p>\n<p>“The miners are back at home and they are fathers, husbands and providers once again,” Tobar said. “They now have the experience of living through an adventure that has taught them the value of the simple things.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Maria Garcia said she found Tobar’s lecture interesting because she did not previously understand the intensity of what the miners underwent.</p>\n<p>“I felt like I got a personal perspective on what they went through, how they suffered and what they had to go through after they came out. It was a really good lecture and I’m really glad I got to see it,” Garcia said. “And now I’m looking forward to buying the book because of everything he said, it was really interesting.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Itzel Cruz said Tobar’s lecture gave her an “inside perspective” on the miners’ story.</p>\n<p>“Seeing it on television is a completely different version than it being told by the writer itself, who personally interviewed these people, stayed with them and got to know each one of them on a personal level,” Cruz said. “You can identify yourself with the Chilean miners and the writer.”</p>\n<p>First-year journalism major at Santa Barbara City College Logan Keaton said Tobar is a “great speaker,” and the lecture made him consider the miners’ experiences in a more personal way.</p>\n<p>“I was amazed at how he got so close with all the miners,” Keaton said. “The different testimonies and experiences that all the miners had, those were inspiring and sad at times. It puts you into perspective looking at the world and everything. You can’t take anything for granted.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66071\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66071\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/","id":2632,"author":{"id":136,"name":"Jessica Aguilar"},"related":[2631,2630,2629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CeCe McDonald Answers Student Questions for Trans Revolution Series","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Resource Center for Sexual & Gender Diversity hosted a discussion with LGBTQ activist CeCe McDonald on Thursday, Oct. 22 in The Hub as part of its Trans Revolution Series.

McDonald stabbed and killed the man in self-defense, but was sent to a male prison for 19 months, leading to the “Free CeCe” movement. After she was released from prison, McDonald began advocating for LGBTQ rights on a national scale. A documentary film about her prison experience and activist work is scheduled to be released in 2016 and will star Laverne Cox from Orange is the New Black.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Sue Aldaram interviewed McDonald, addressing the moment McDonald was forced to defend herself as well as the overall issues of transphobia and racism.

She is a voice that enlightens minds of the revolutionary youth.”</p>\n<p>When asked about her feelings on prison reconstruction, McDonald said “there is no reconstruction.” According to McDonald, America takes ideology and turns it into a law then “deems it criminal.”</p>\n<p>“I’d just destroy the shit,” McDonald said. “I’m definitely an abolitionist.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Ph.D. student in feminist studies Chelsea Jones said McDonald’s lecture thoroughly addressed the topic of the prison industrial complex.</p>\n<p>“She covered all the bases beautifully, connecting the prison industrial complex to capitalism, racism, to transphobia, to basically all of us,” Jones said. “She’s a prison abolitionist and not a reformist, and that distinction is super important because you can’t fix something that is inherently fucked up.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article said the discussion took place on Thursday, October 29 instead of Thursday October 22.

Gutierrez called the abuse of detained LGBTQ undocumented immigrants to Obama’s attention, demanding an end to their deportation. On Thursday, Gutierrez will speak on her continued work campaigning for LGBTQ rights and her role as a founding member of Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ and Latin@ communities.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Ricardo Uribe said students should attend Gutierrez’s talk because the LGBTQ community is often poorly represented by the media.</p>\n<p>“I figured that it is kind of important to hear the stories and learn the other side about people who are not being spoken about or not being represented in the media in order to learn more about their struggles,” Uribe said.</p>\n<p>First-year computer engineering major Melanie Flandes said Gutierrez is an empowering leader who, by sharing her story and experiences, can motivate others to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“There are not a lot of people I feel would stand up to the president like that, and for her to have the courage and the ability to do that really does make a difference because now people are going to feel like their voices are being heard,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>Flandes said Gutierrez coming to UCSB will empower underrepresented communities on campus.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing and learning about her story and how these issues [have] impacted her life gives hope that a difference can be made,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Eriko Spurlock said she will attend Gutierrez’s talk in part because she of how much she learned from hearing LGBTQ activist CeCe McDonald speak in October as part of the Trans Revolution Series.</p>\n<p>“I found that these events were helpful in increasing my understanding for the experiences other marginalized women go through, especially since we all have different struggles that we each face based on different factors,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said she thinks students should attend Gutierrez’s lecture to learn more about the issues the LGBTQ community face.</p>\n<p>“I feel this event is important for students to come out to in order to open their eyes and gain more understanding for the society, the constructs we live in, and how the current power dynamics are made to marginalize so many people in collectively various ways,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said although the topics of immigration and LGBTQ rights are often discussed separately, it is important to see the connection between the two.</p>\n<p>“Immigration and LGBTQAP+ issues on their own are very important to learn more about and understand, but a lot of people think that these two topics are mutually exclusive when the reality is that everything is connected a lot more than we think they are,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Gabriela Flores said she is looking forward to hearing Gutierrez speak, especially after seeing Shane Ortega, the first openly transgender soldier in the United States military, speak in October, also a part of the Trans Revolution series.</p>\n<p>“I recently attended the one where Shane Ortega came out to speak about his experience as the first openly trans man in the U.S. military, and since I learned a lot from that event, I decided to attend the next one,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>Flores said students should learn more about marginalized communities and support their fight for equality.</p>\n<p>“People need to start paying attention to things like this because these discrimination crimes are only increasing,” Flores said. “We are hurting people in our community by not fighting by their side or hearing them out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

smaller crowds and resulting in fewer misdemeanor arrests and medical evacuations compared to previous years.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), crowds on the streets in I.V. numbered approximately 500 people, largely UCSB students and other local residents, compared to several thousand in 2014 and 12,000 to 15,000 in 2013, a large portion of which were out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>SBSO reports an estimated 28 misdemeanor arrests were made on Friday and Saturday compared to the 40 made in 2014 and 200 over a three-day period in 2013. There were seven medical transports, also significantly lower than in previous years, according to the SBSO.</p>\n<p>SBSO attributed the quiet weekend to alternative, campus-based events, which drew crowds away from house parties and limited Halloween festivities to UCSB students. The Associated Students Program Board drew many students off the streets of I.V. and into the Thunderdome with musical performances by Fitz and the Tantrums on Friday and Snoop Dogg on Saturday.</p>\n<p>SBSO Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said the Sherriff’s Office “credits the students” for the decrease in visitors from out of town coming to I.V. to celebrate Halloween.</p>\n<p>“[The] community has been through a lot, and the students no longer wanted to risk inviting out-of-towners,” Hoover said. “We believe the students have a lot of pride in our community and had a huge hand in keeping the event local.”</p>\n<p>Hoover also said student organizations like UCIV working alongside law enforcement contributed to the relative quietness of Halloween this year.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing like students helping enforce the rules, and they were passing out safety tips and passing out water,” Hoover said. “They were reminding students to move their cars and keep in accordance with the ordinance. It was really great working with students this weekend.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair and second-year global studies and political science double-major Dwayne Mosbey said the relationship between students and police officers was more positive than in previous years.</p>\n<p>“You could walk down the street and see officers playing Frisbee with some of the people walking about,” Mosbey said. “There was a record low number of [citations] handed out this year.”</p>\n<p>Mosbey also said the two concerts hosted by A.S. Program Board were “incredibly effective” at preventing crowds in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The only time I saw traffic while walking I.V. was students going to the concerts,” Mosbey said. “I applaud and am so appreciative of Program Board for putting on such a great program this year with artists that the students just really wanted to hear.”</p>\n<p>Mosbey also said the UCIV efforts received “incredibly positive feedback” throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>“Even when our volunteers went to warn people about the noise ordinance, their warnings were received in a very positive manner and they really appreciated what we were doing,” Mosbey said.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said organizations like UCIV help “shift the culture” in I.V. toward community policing.</p>\n<p>“These students were giving out warnings about noise ordinances and citations,” Dela Cruz said. “I’m just really glad to have seen Isla Vista safe and local.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said community events like Haunt-a-Loop, which invited local children to trick-or-treat on Pardall Road Saturday afternoon and early evening, were “really successful” in making Halloween weekend a more positive and community-based event.</p>\n<p>“That event to me signified a shift in culture — of students taking a stance and saying we want to make sure that the families and the children in our community know that they can also trick-or-treat in Isla Vista, that it’s not just a place where students are just going to get drunk,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said I.V. businesses helped collaborate with A.S. to promote a safe Halloween by providing T-shirts and giveaway items for a Scavenger Hunt.</p>\n<p>“Our local businesses came together and gave us free stuff and helped us enjoy ourselves,” Dela Cruz said. “It was a collaborative effort and students enjoyed it.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Andrea Cisneros said over the past few years the police presence has changed the Halloween culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The Halloween from my first year was very different from this year,” Cisneros said. “My first year, Halloween was a big deal. There were still some of the same regulations — like in the residence halls we weren’t allowed to have visitors — but there weren’t that many police.”</p>\n<p>Cisneros said the alternative events UCSB planned were effective in deterring students from partying on Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>“Having Snoop Dogg and filling the Thunderdome on the weekend was a great success,” Cisneros said. “I think people took initiative to plan alternative events because they understand that not everyone wants to party this weekend, which was really nice.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Lydia Gil said the alternative, student-only events helped decrease the crowds in I.V. and kept out-of-towners from visiting I.V. over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“They helped discourage the idea that it gets super crowded here during Halloween because most people were busy with the activities,” Gil said in an email. “I think this will also discourage more people from coming next year.”</p>\n<p>Gil said this year the Halloween celebration in I.V. was safer and more enjoyable than years past.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was better because there were more options, like having two concerts and the roller skating at the Rec. Cen.,” Gil said in an email. “Also, there wasn’t too many people walking the streets, so it wasn’t that crazy.”</p>\n<p>First-year biopsychology major John Nguyen said although the police presence in I.V. over the weekend was alarming at first, he felt safer throughout the weekend with a visible law enforcement present.</p>\n<p>“I think students were shocked by the amount of police presence,” Nguyen said. “But I think the ultimate consensus was that the police presence made us feel safer.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-65963\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) hosted the second Pizza with Police event of the year Thursday which allowed I.V. residents and UCSB students to speak directly with local police about ordinances for Halloween.</p>\n<p>Pizza with Police provides an opportunity for students and residents to meet officers and deputies from both departments to ask questions about local law enforcement in the community. Law enforcement officers addressed concerns about police barricades, amnesty legislation, noise ordinance and Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p>UCPD Sergeant Matt Bowman said the festival ordinance on loud music, which began Oct. 26, will be in place until Nov. 4.</p>\n<p>“The ordinance is if it’s able to be heard from the street, so that means the property line, so police walk out to the street to listen,” Bowman said. “If they can hear it, it’s too loud.”</p>\n<p>According to Bowman, streets will be cleared of cars and police barricades will be in place from 5 p.m. until 3 a.m. on the days surrounding Halloween.</p>\n<p>“At about 3 p.m., they’re going to start towing cars off the street, and, again, that’s to benefit the entire community, because it gets so compacted with people walking up and down the street that those extra cars on the street make it unpassable, and we need to open it up,” Bowman said.</p>\n<p>Bowman said the barricades will not completely block off the roads because some vehicles may need to pass in an emergency.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want you to, but if it’s an emergency situation, you may — but, goodness, be careful; there’s a lot of people out there,” Bowman said.</p>\n<p>Bowman said it is important to understand amnesty legislation, which protects any individual from being charged for possession if they call emergency services for someone in need of help.</p>\n<p>“Amnesty is legislation … that says police officers will not make arrests in cases where people call to get people medical aid,” Bowman said. “So remove that fear, get that person the help that they need, because the last thing any of us want, I’m sure, certainly all the officers, is for somebody to not get the help they need when they’re intoxicated or overdosing or something like that.”</p>\n<p>Bowman also said UCSB’s costume policy bans students from wearing masks on campus, and wearing them in I.V. may make things more difficult for officers.</p>\n<p>“If you are detained by an officer, they do have the right to identify you if they have reasonable suspicion or probable cause, so you may be asked to remove it to verify who it is under the mask,” Bowman said.</p>\n<p>IVFP Deputy Julio Gutierrez said he expects Halloween this year to be tamer than in past years.</p>\n<p>“I think that after the riots, the community has done a very good job of keeping it low-key, keeping it a more localized event,” Gutierrez said. “I know a lot more students this year are against having outsiders come in. For the most part, they’re doing their part.”</p>\n<p>According to Gutierrez, starting the music ordinance at 6 p.m. will help prevent problems as the night progresses.</p>\n<p>“Because the Halloween event is one that is known to attract a lot of outsiders, what a lot of people do is they tend to party during the day and come out to the streets at night,” Gutierrez said. “If you party during the day, drink alcohol during the day, by the time night time comes around, people are intoxicated, they make poor decisions, inhibitions are thrown to the wind, then we have the problems in the latter part of the night.”</p>\n<p>Gutierrez said law enforcement officers are present to ensure safety, and Halloween is no different from any other night.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to ensure that if someone is intoxicated to the point where they can’t care for themselves, that they’ll have someone watch out for them,” Gutierrez said. “Unfortunately, watching out for them in that state means taking them to the hospital or to jail. People drink; sometimes they go overboard. As long as everybody’s safe and no one gets hurt or injured, then, for us, that’s a good night.”</p>\n<p>Deputy Kim Fryslie said the best way for students to make sure they are not breaking laws is to understand them. Fryslie recommends students to Google “SB County ordinances” and look on the county page at the following link: <em><a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/lawsregulations.sbc\">countyofsb.org/lawsregulations.sbc</a></em></p>\n<p>“I think a lot of the problem in Isla Vista is that the information is presented to the students in such a way that some find it not very comprehensive, and this site will be helpful to those who want to know exactly … how they can safely follow the rules,” Fryslie said.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez said law enforcement and students have the same goal for Halloween celebrations.</p>\n<p>“I think a perfect night for us is we come out here, we patrol and we don’t have to arrest anybody or write any tickets,” Gutierrez said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

(SACC) to form one housing student government titled the “UCSB Housing Association.”</p>\n<p>RHA aims to better connect students living on and off campus through collaborative events. If approved by students, the UCSB Housing Association will begin functioning in about five years. It is possible the Graduate Student Apartments Community Council (GSACC) will join as well.</p>\n<p>RHA Vice President of Finance Jacob Johnson said residents could benefit from “stronger” organization and programming services.</p>\n<p>“Week of Welcome could become a lot stronger and more inclusive for those who live in undergrad apartments,” Johnson said in an email. “This change allows greater communication and collaboration with the multiple areas of campus, such as the undergraduate apartments, and I.V.”</p>\n<p>RHA president and third-year psychology major Matilda Mead said the future UCSB Housing Association could provide more leadership opportunities by refining the housing experience for transfer students who tend to be “neglected” on campus.</p>\n<p>“We would be giving them the opportunities for developing leadership experience that come with our title as an association, such as conference opportunities, summer Student Leadership Development training (currently RA and RHA training), additional positions within the RHA Coordinating Board and RHA Councils, and myriad networking connections ranging from within our campus to across our nation,” Mead said in an email.</p>\n<p>Former San Rafael Hall Resident Assistant and fourth-year Asian American studies major Myra Cheah said she favors the change in hopes it will make the transition for transfer students easier.</p>\n<p>“I think programming more heavier, wishing apartments would be great for transfers,” Cheah said.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Renee Zapata said living on campus has been a positive experience and she wants to see housing-related student government grow.</p>\n<p>“That’s great to see that RHA is able to improve the living experience for students,” Zapata said. “The fact that it is able to get better than it is, is awesome. I don’t see why students would vote against this change.”</p>\n<p>Johnson said RHA wants “everyone’s input” about the potential change.</p>\n<p>“Our organization runs hand in hand with the student voice,” Johnson said.<br>\n“We are proposing this to the students and are depending on their voice on how and if we should proceed.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/","id":2629,"author":{"id":145,"name":"Anna Yoo"},"related":[2628,2627,2626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate voted 13 to 8 on Wednesday to table a bill that would require student political parties to register as Office of Student Life (OSL) groups and abide by judicial procedures for claims of hazing or discrimination.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double-major Nawar Nemeh presented the bill, titled, “A Bill to Update Article XVII Section 5, 7, &amp; 8,” in response to alleged hazing of candidates within the Open People’s Party (OPP) and low student turnout for past elections. Under the bill, an OSL advisor would be assigned to each political party to monitor the group for any misconduct.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and second-year Asian-American studies and political science double-major Akshaya Natarajan said she supports the bill because of her prior experience campaigning with OPP.</p>\n<p>“As a senator that ran with OPP this past election cycle, I felt tokenized, and I felt whitewashed as a woman of color, flat out,” Natarajan said. “When I saw [my] picture, I literally laughed out loud. I was like what the fuck? I am three shades lighter than I actually am … and I was terrified.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year history of public policy and political science double-major Jerel Constantino said that political parties can be monitored internally rather than through OSL.</p>\n<p>“[A.S. staff members] are employed because they’re to not have conflicts of interest — it’s how they are employed,” Constantino said. “Their job is to be impartial and to work for the students. I have no concern of giving them authority.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik said he supports the bill, recalling a time he felt pressured by members of his party.</p>\n<p>“I had two papers due, I was on academic probation in my classes and I told one of the party leaders specifically … if I don’t finish these papers, I will be ineligible to run because I will get Fs in my classes,” Abdalmalik said. “Their response was, ‘you’re really letting everyone down; you have to fucking go or else.’”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said requiring parties to register as OSL groups would not lead to OSL governing the A.S. program as a whole.</p>\n<p>“Parties … are not A.S, it’s that simple,” Abdalmalik said. “A party is a political faction that runs in order to get a place in A.S. This bill would not be regulating A.S as an organization, it would be regulating an unregulated, unchecked power that has the potential — and has in the past — to harm students in it.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year political science major Austin Hechler said an OSL advisor might be ineffective, suggesting that A.S. staff members regulate the parties because they are more familiar with the process and accessible to senators.</p>\n<p>“The fact that having parties join as an OSL group will make hazing stop, that is completely false,” Hechler said. “I feel like someone who’s in A.S. that you see on a daily basis . . . [members] would be more comfortable to report hazing to them because they are an accessible advisor than someone who is in OSL that comes around once a year.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza said groups form a hierarchy within A.S.</p>\n<p>“We’re being blind to the fact that O.P.P. runs year round. Let’s be honest; if you’re not in that little clique of OPP, if you’re not connected to A.S., you’re not going to know that you can run for an exec. position or senator because that option is not publicized everywhere,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan said that having political parties exist year-round would increase tension and further divide party lines within A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, I think it’s going to create more of a bubble than we already have,” Jordan said. “I think if we put a political party to our name year round, we get this tunnel vision of ‘oh I must align with my party’s ideals.’”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he proposed the bill to shed light on the culture of hazing within A.S., adding that members can treat each other in the “most toxic of ways” and very few victims feel comfortable coming forward.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of cases of students feeling victimized for their sexualities, feeling victimized about their work ethic, their relationships,” Nemeh said. “People don’t talk about how we treat each other and how we behave. I think it’s about damn time we do.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said even though A.S. voted to table the bill indefinitely, starting a conversation about hazing within A.S. is also important.</p>\n<p>“My bill intended to bring that to the forefront, and in that sense, I do think it was successful regardless of the fact that it was tabled indefinitely,” Nemeh said. “It opened up a conversation about something that no one has talked about before, which is student conduct within the association.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal declined comment until he can review Wednesday’s senate minutes.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65969\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65969\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/","id":3976,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3975,3974,3973],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The meeting focused on incorporating a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and an Area Planning Commission (APC) with the CSD.</p>\n<p>According to Community Organizer from Das Williams’s office Darcel Elliott, the Initiative’s weekly meetings serve as forums for residents to discuss local government options within the framework of a CSD.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The goal of these meetings is to talk about the services that the CSD can provide and discuss how we would want these provided under that structure, and also create some community priorities,” Elliot said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City Council member Gregg Hart was a member of the previous I.V. Community Council (IVCC), a MAC, during the 1980s, which dissolved after the county and UC cut funding. According to Hart, the county stopped funding the MAC because the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors felt IVCC was not solving I.V.’s issues and was therefore not “serving the function” that was intended.</p>\n<p>“Issues remained contentious and difficult and didn’t always get resolved,” Hart said. “They were looking for more finality, more cohesion and consensus coming from Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Hart said a CSD through Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) will provide I.V. the autonomy and structure needed to solve issues.<br>\n“I thought AB 3 was a great step forward,” Hart said. “I supported it — sent letters to the governor. It’s time. Isla Vista deserves this kind of representation.”</p>\n<p>According to Glenn Russell, Director of Planning and Development for the County of Santa Barbara, APCs review development projects in their designated community and advise the Board of Supervisors on these projects.</p>\n<p>“For certain development projects, they are the final decision maker, unless it is appealed to the Board of Supervisors,” Russell said. “For other projects, they make a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors.”</p>\n<p>Russell said the current APCs in Santa Barbara County, including the Montecito APC and the Santa Barbara APC, review the Board of Supervisors’ projects but cannot “initiate policy.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65925\" style=\"width: 692px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2100988285\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65928\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65925\" data-attachment-id=\"65925\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/meeting-attendees-listen-attentively-as-others-voice-their-opinions/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Meeting attendees listen attentively as others voice their opinions.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445923127\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"Meeting attendees listen attentively as others voice their opinions.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-65925 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1-682x1024.jpg?resize=682%2C1024\" alt=\"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65925\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“They do not advise the Board on issues they feel are important,” Russell said. “They simply review projects and review policy initiatives and community plans that are ordinances initiated by the Board.”</p>\n<p>According to Russell, the cost per meeting for the Montecito APC is around $3,000, which he said would be similar for I.V. Elliott, however, said the cost could be reduced to $2,000 per meeting.</p>\n<p>Longtime resident Sue Dixon said local issues “generate” from poor planning and development, therefore she supports the establishment of an APC.</p>\n<p>“The density is because of how it was zoned in the first place, and as we continue to make variances as we build more buildings, it increases the parking problem and crime and everything else,” Dixon said. “I think it’s really fundamental to have that power here.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) chairperson and longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said a MAC would address issues such as parking and policing more effectively and extensively than the Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p>“I see it as being really beneficial because you can do much more engagement here in the community with a series of meetings here than one or two meetings downtown,” Soutar said. “The more that we coalesce and the more we show up with similar ideas and concerns, the more we will be listened to.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats president and fourth-year chemistry major Krishna Hammond said the same representatives should govern a MAC and CSD to eliminate the ambiguity of what each entity is able to discuss.</p>\n<p>“I think there should be as much overlap as possible because it neatly avoids the question of what we’re allowed to talk about,” Hammond said. “It’s a sort of conservation of bureaucracy. There’s one less conversation that needs to come up.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while the CSD leadership should have a presence in a MAC, some seats should be open to stakeholders that cannot be elected or appointed to a CSD governing board, such as nonprofit organization representatives.</p>\n<p>“I think we should have the MAC and the CSD have some overlap, but not a great deal,” Abboud said. “My personal opinion is that all five elected CSD members should also be on the MAC but the MAC should be, say, six additional stakeholder groups and organizations.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, October 29 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65928\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65928\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/i-v-stakeholders-talk-framework-options-for-self-governance/","id":4620,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[4619,4618,4617],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":107,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
