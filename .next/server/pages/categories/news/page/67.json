Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to the resolution, numerous students have been removed from housing due to their mental disabilities. The resolution reads that disability discrimination is “an issue that constantly looms over UCSB students” and calls for the alteration or removal of the “Personal Care” clause in the UCSB housing contract.</p>\n<p>The “Personal Care Clause,” located under the Personal Care section of the housing contract, states that “residents are responsible for their own self-care and personal needs.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB Residential and Community living claims to ‘value diversity and inclusivity,’ but actively removes/refuses students who are neuroatypical without alternative housing options, contributing to disability discrimination within housing, student housing insecurity, and poor mental health,” the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>The resolution was authored by Senator Alison Sir and Senator Anthony Pimentel and was developed and finalized on Jan. 23, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>“I felt a resolution was the most efficient solution to make a plan of action by creating a committee and working on this issue head on,” Sir said.</p>\n<p>She added that the students who brought the issue to her attention would like to remain anonymous due to the “extremity and sensitivity of this particular issue.”</p>\n<p>Pimentel said that the issue was first brought to Sir and she asked him to be the co-author. Students with a mental disability are part of a community that is oftentimes “overlooked,” Pimentel said.</p>\n<p>“When this type of mistreatment to a community occurs, I find it necessary and critical that, as a student leader, I do all that I can to hold the people responsible for their mistreatment to a community of students who need the most support,” he said.</p>\n<p>The resolution states that the “personal care” clause should be eliminated and a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities should be created.</p>\n<p>The Senate demands that UCSB Housing include a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities because “citing C.A.P.S. is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB Housing contract states that Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through 805-893-4411.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the contract states that C.A.P.S. offers a large range of services, including crisis intervention, individual and group counseling, psychological assessment, stress management and referrals to outside agencies.</p>\n<p>The Senate resolution, however, states that C.A.P.S. is prevented from “being an adequate source of relief for students with short- and long-term mental illnesses” because only a limited number of appointments can be provided for each student.</p>\n<p>The resolution adds that C.A.P.S. is “severely understaffed.”</p>\n<p>Sir said she and Pimentel are currently planning to have a meeting with C.A.P.S. to discuss the program and the concerns outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The clause “provides much gray area for Housing and Residential Services to work with in illegally excluding mentally ill students from UCSB Housing,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Currently, it is “considered reasonable” for UCSB Housing to remove or reject individuals who have a history of mental instability and who are not currently being treated to “mitigate the mental instability,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>On-campus housing is held to different standards than other landlord-tenant relationships as a government community-based housing entity.</p>\n<p>Pimentel and Sir will be holding a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee Feb. 2 in the Nati conference room from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. to discuss a plan combatting the Personal Care Clause, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Interested students and the general public are invited to attend to share their own experiences or voice their opinions on this issue, Pimentel said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Congress has until Feb. 8 to agree on government spending, and until then will abide by short-term bill H.R. 195 to fund the government without coming to a resolution for the children of undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump formally ended DACA on Sept. 5, 2017 and expects to fully end the program by March 5.</p>\n<p>It is uncertain where DACA will leave its 800,000 recipients at a federal level, but California legislators and the University of California (UC) have stated they will continue to provide support for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“If there’s a federal restriction, then there will be a restriction for federal resources for undocumented students in accessing them; however, for most resources they don’t need DACA to access, for example, The California Dream Act,” said Diana Valdivia, coordinator of Dream Scholars/Undocumented Students Services at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Valdivia said the California Dream Act, which allows undocumented individuals who have AB 540 status to apply for financial aid at the state and institutional level, will not be affected by DACA ending. Educational aid in California will not be affected regardless of DACA status.</p>\n<p>The UC Immigrant Legal Services Center will continue to provide legal services to undocumented students with or without DACA, according to Valdivia.</p>\n<p>In 2013, the UC Office of the President allocated $5 million across the 10 UC campuses for undocumented student support and later earmarked $8.4 million a year through the 2018-19 academic year to be divided among the UC’s DREAM Loan Program, Undocumented Legal Services and targeted undergraduate and graduate fellowships.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano also released a <a href=\"http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC-Community-DACA-FINAL.pdf\">statement</a> on Sept. 12, 2017, expressing support for undocumented students and prohibited UC campus police from contacting, detaining and arresting individuals based on suspected undocumented status.</p>\n<p>In September, Gov. Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">signed</a> Senate Bill 54, which declared California a sanctuary state, prohibiting local and state law enforcement agencies from collaborating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal received local <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/no-daca-no-deal-dont-take-your-students-for-granted/\">backlash</a> on his decision to vote for H.R. 195, since the government shutdown was later seen as a Democratic tactic to demand legal protection for undocumented students. His campaign platform was largely based on supporting undocumented students.</p>\n<p>At an open forum, Carbajal representative Elijah Ettenger said that Carbajal voted for H.R. 195 to maintain private assistance for mudslide victims in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>According to a Congressional Affairs Advisory document, certain requests for individual disaster assistance will no longer be possible during a government shutdown. These include requests for case management and crisis counseling, which would require review or approval from a furloughed employee.</p>\n<p>Trump has expressed openness to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/24/white-house-promises-new-immigration-framework-amid-stalled-negotiations-on-dreamers/?utm_term=.de1df0750fa9\">deal</a> that would create a path to citizenship for DACA recipients in exchange for funding of his promised wall at the border of the United States and Mexico. Valdivia did not offer an opinion on the possibility.</p>\n<p>“If you were to ask me and then you ask someone else, then their notion would be different,” she said. “It would be a political guess.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80742\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/uc-california-to-support-undocumented-students-despite-daca-repeal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80742\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/uc-california-to-support-undocumented-students-despite-daca-repeal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/uc-california-to-support-undocumented-students-despite-daca-repeal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/uc-california-to-support-undocumented-students-despite-daca-repeal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/uc-california-to-support-undocumented-students-despite-daca-repeal/","id":3612,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[3611,3610,3609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Lieutenant to Head Up Isla Vista Foot Patrol","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/camarena.jpg?resize=233%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/camarena.jpg?resize=233%2C300&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) is now led by a new station lieutenant, who took over the position this week after the departure of Lt.

Juan Camarena. <em>Courtesy of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div>\n<p>Lt. Juan Camarena will transfer from the Human Resources Bureau of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), where he has worked for 19 years, including service in the Major Crimes Division.</p>\n<p>Cintron was transferred to the Criminal Investigations Bureau, where he intends to ride out a nearly 28-year career into retirement. His transfer was part of a regular SBSO rotational schedule, under which officers serve for about two years in a division before rotating to another job.</p>\n<p>This won’t be the first time Camarena will serve in I.V., as he worked brief stints with the IVFP while he was a sheriff’s deputy in the late 2000s. He noted that I.V. today has a far less populous weekend party scene, crediting his predecessors for “making things safer” for the community.</p>\n<p>Born in Mexico to migrant field workers, Camarena is a first-language Spanish speaker, reader and writer. He joined the Marines out of high school before starting at the SBSO.</p>\n<p>Camarena said he will open his doors to both UC Santa Barbara students and I.V.’s robust Spanish-speaking population. While he’s getting settled into the job and familiarizing himself with the neighborhood, he said he will work to police by the “golden rule.”</p>\n<p>“Using just the simple values I learned from my parents will open the doors for me to address the community and build that trust,” he said.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents in the past year have reacted strongly to reports of burglaries and sexual assaults.</p>\n<p>In May, Cintron attended an I.V. Community Services District Town Hall to address resident concerns directly. Camarena emphasized his own commitment to preventing assaults from occurring. While law enforcement won’t have all the answers, he said, a unified I.V. might be a step toward solution.</p>\n<p>“Little by little, I’m trying to introduce myself to the different communities so we can see what we in law enforcement and the community need to do to find that fair balance, so I.V. will be a safe place to live, to work in and visit,” Camarena said.</p>\n<p><strong>Cintron, by the numbers </strong></p>\n<p>Since Cintron came onto the IVFP in March 2016, crime rates have roughly improved in the neighborhood over a two-year period, according to statistics provided by SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover.</p>\n<p>There were 190 burglaries in I.V in 2015, 196 in 2016 and 106 in 2017 through Nov. 29.</p>\n<p>When it comes to simple and aggravated assault, the numbers fluctuated.</p>\n<p>Between July 2015 and June 2016 there were 181 simple assaults, while between July 2016 and June 2017 there were 149.</p>\n<p>There were 35 aggravated assaults between July 2015 and June 2016 and 37 between July 2016 and June 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Cintron reflects on achievements, challenges</strong></p>\n<p>Cintron, who took up the post of station lieutenant in March 2016, said he believes he helped I.V. continue a “trajectory toward the better” during his time.</p>\n<p>“I fully embraced and engaged with the community,” he said. His proudest efforts were put toward preserving community safety and reducing police presence during Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement presence decreased under Cintron’s watch, alongside a decline in crime. During the four-day period through Halloween 2016, the IVFP stationed nearly 300 officers. Less than 100 IVFP officers patrolled the streets during the same period in 2017.</p>\n<p>Cintron’s tenure didn’t go without controversy. A proposed noise ordinance in Oct. 2016 threatened to scale existing “no-loud-music” restrictions from midnight back to 10 p.m. on weekend nights. A sizable community response, comprised mostly of UCSB students, railed against the proposition. The IVFP promptly <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-17/foot-patrol-postpones-noise-ordinance-change-in-response-to-community-pushback/\">delayed</a> and later nixed the plan.<br>\nCintron maintains that the noise ordinance was never his idea; before he’d arrived, the IVFP was “constantly” receiving noise complaints and Cintron was told to finish the job, he said.</p>\n<p>For the most part, though, the community has made things easier for him, he said, which will, in turn, make things easier for Camarena, whom he called “very open-minded.”</p>\n<p>Nearing 30 years on the job at the SBSO, Cintron’s stint in I.V. will likely be the penultimate leg of his career.</p>\n<p>“It was a challenge, but I learned a lot,” he said. “A lot of different ideas from different people. It was a good time. A good two years.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 4 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Wang</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice came to speak at the Arlington Theatre last Thursday, discussing domestic politics, Donald Trump and modern rights movements.</p>\n<p>Rice is a controversial figure due to her role in the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq while working under the Bush administration. Critics accuse her of advocating for the war, despite doubts about the credibility of the intelligence regarding the building of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein.</p>\n<p>This dissension caused the debut of a protest group called the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective.<br>\nMembers of the newly formed organization greeted attendees with chants such as “Lock her up” and “Arrest the war criminal.”</p>\n<p>While Rice avoided the topic of the demonstrators, she made an effort to justify her decisions in the 2003 invasion.</p>\n<p>Rice explained that Iraq was difficult to predict. As the National Security Advisor at the time, she believed that data concluded that Saddam Hussein was working toward weapons of mass destruction.<br>\nThough the invasion showed this presumption was incorrect, Rice felt she had reacted appropriately under the precarious circumstances.</p>\n<p>Despite this argument, demonstrators continued to voice their disapproval.</p>\n<p>“I’m upset that they’re bringing in Condi Rice to speak at UCSB as if she was a legitimate authority on anything,” Howard Winant, UCSB professor of sociology, said. “She used her academic credentials to manipulate and murder and torture and commit war crimes.”</p>\n<p>Cara Yoshizumi, one of the founders of the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective, protested due to a more general anti-war sentiment.</p>\n<p>“So much of our country’s resources go into war and killing and environmental destruction,” Yoshizumi said. “The U.S. is an advanced and rich country, and yet we don’t have things like free education and free health care, like most advanced countries do. All of that is because of misplaced priorities, like the war in Iraq.”</p>\n<p>Some of the audience attended not in support, but instead to critique and gain perspective on Rice.<br>\n“We are not here in support of her, we just want an abstract of what she’s about,” audience member Jeff Smith said.</p>\n<p>“She was definitely a part of it… she’s guilty,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Inside, Rice talked identity politics, criticizing Donald Trump’s “America First” slogan.<br>\nShe contested that a “confident country” is focused on an international level of “larger good,” not just the success of Americans. Rice defined this as spreading democracy and balancing trade.</p>\n<p>In her Q&amp;A session, Rice voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movement, but referred to kneeling for the National Anthem as divisive symbolism.</p>\n<p>The self-proclaimed feminist also criticized the #MeToo movement. She said that though she overall supported and praised the purpose it served, she warned against oversensitivity of followers.</p>\n<p>Rice voiced concern that young women wouldn’t be equipped for the real world, stating she hoped the movement didn’t teach that “women can’t take care of themselves, because they can.”</p>\n<p>On immigration policy, Rice took a positive approach, stating, “immigration has been the lifeblood of this country.”</p>\n<p>Rice reproached Trump’s decision to build a wall between the Mexico and United States border, stating that “a wall doesn’t have to be a physical thing.”</p>\n<p>She backed this argument by claiming that net immigration from Mexico is zero. Rice said that Central America is the source of criminal immigrants, making the wall ineffective.</p>\n<p>Though Rice called the past year’s number of 40,000 refugees under the Trump administration lacking, she did suggest capping the number at 70,000.</p>\n<p>She broke down the modern system for integrating immigrants through private charities. She explained that a number above 70,000 would be too strenuous on the system, potentially causing it to collapse.</p>\n<p>Despite protests and critics, a large number of attendees showed support for Rice by reflecting on her accomplishments.</p>\n<p>“Her education, she was a pianist, she was considered to be a position in the football commission, and she’s a woman… this shows she’s a well-rounded leadership type,” Santa Barbara resident Grace Johnson said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

as the new ED for IVYP,” Goodman said in an email. “I strongly believe that investing in children, providing them with all [they] need to learn, to be emotionally secure and to be successful is the best investment we can make as a society.”</p>\n<p>Goodman’s assignment will begin Jan. 28, following the retirement of Executive Director LuAnn Miller after 30 years of work. The organization itself was founded in 1971 by community members after riotous protests that resulted in the burning of the Bank of America in I.V.</p>\n<p>Goodman said that she wants to expand on Miller’s legacy. She described Miller as an “authentic, caring and competent leader” who grew the IVYP “from a small child care center to the diverse and impactful organization it is today.”</p>\n<p>Goodman’s optimism reflects her passion for the program. She said that her main goal currently is to learn everything about the IVYP, from her duties to the people, programs and partners that surround the agency.</p>\n<p>She explained that one of the major challenges she expects to face during her first few months is funding, as with many nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p>“Most of IVYP’s budget comes through the California State Department of Education,” she said. “I have a lot to learn about how that funding works, but my experience with governmental funding is that it rarely pays enough to provide the salary and benefits that teachers deserve.”</p>\n<p>She also described IVYP’s relationship to UCSB as “unique” especially as an increase in UCSB admission rates will affect housing in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As UCSB moves forward in its plan to enroll more students, that will likely impact housing and services in Isla Vista. Anticipating those changes and ensuring that children and families are not forgotten will be part of my agenda,” she said.</p>\n<p>In the future, she wants to focus on spreading awareness about IVYP and its comprehensive role both in and out of the community.</p>\n<p>“More people should know what we’re doing. We serve children and families in I.V. and Goleta, but our leadership can and should be recognized far and wide,” she said.</p>\n<p>As Miller prepares to conclude her long career at IVYP, she remains grateful for the ability to have genuinely enjoyed every day of work over a span of 33 years. She began at IVYP as a teacher and assumed the role of executive director a year later.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been blessed with the perfect intersection of education, skill set, passion and faith: the ability to do meaningful work to make a difference in our community,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>The next stages in Miller’s life include plans for traveling, cooking, focusing on her health and enjoying time with her husband.</p>\n<p>“I hope I will be remembered as someone who led with heart and head,” she said. “Someone who believed that all the children and families deserve equal access to education, safety, health and respect… someone who truly enjoyed the energy, vibrancy and goodness in Isla Vista that is often missed up those outside the community.”</p>\n<p>Miller hopes that Goodman will fall in love with IVYP.</p>\n<p>“At IVYP, we are working to address the root causes of so many societal problems. When we have strong, whole children and families, our community thrives. What could be more important than that?” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>Goodman is also no stranger to community service.

the Nov. 17 meeting. <em>Will Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Several students and faculty members attended Thursday’s meeting in the Graduate Student Lounge in the MultiCultural Center to learn more about the future of the center and share their own goals and concerns.</p>\n<p>“The town hall is an opportunity to share with students what has been going on at the RCSGD as well as to ask for input on what our plans for the future might be,” said Justice Dumlao, the RCSGD diversity education facilitator during an interactive group discussion.</p>\n<p>During a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-17/resource-center-for-sexual-and-gender-diversity-receives-approval-for-new-building-doubled-budget-after-university-signs-demands/\">previous meeting</a> on Nov. 17, RCSGD staff presented a list of demands to the administration and claimed that the WGSE did not treat them fairly. The staff referenced a Nov. 14 incident when the center’s associate director was fired and removed from the Student Resource Building without warning.</p>\n<p>The RCSGD was immediately removed from underneath its umbrella organization and the university administration agreed to a freestanding building that would house the new RCSGD, as well as several other demands that included a doubling of the program’s budget.</p>\n<p>The organization’s current name will be changed later this year.</p>\n<p>“The RCSGD title had previously fit the student body but may no longer accommodate the communities’ needs,” said Hikaru Ezra Mernin, the Transforce task coordinator.</p>\n<p>Mernin explained that it may be difficult for students to tell their friends or family members “I work at the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity,” which is why a slightly more ambiguous or “non-outing” title should be established.</p>\n<p>They also said that the lack of adequate assistance has made tasks “more complex” and has been “hindering the RCGSD’s progress.”</p>\n<p>Students also expressed concern about the graduate student hiring process. Many felt that undergraduates should be able to work with the administration to determine which candidates may be a good fit.</p>\n<p>RCSGD office manager Ogui Gonzalez said the “student voices are currently not centered and students should be able to put in their input and be involved in the interview process.”</p>\n<p>In addition to increased participation in the hiring process, students requested upperclassmen housing for queer and transgender students.</p>\n<p>Diversity Programs Director Carlos Nash said that this may be implemented in the future because the housing faculty members are already planning to incorporate Living Learning Communities into upperclassmen housing.</p>\n<p>“The Newman Housing Queer and Trans Cooperative in Isla Vista is currently taking applications, and interested students should apply as soon as they can,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Newman House provides LGBTQ students with the chance to live in an inclusive environment and to meet other people from the community.</p>\n<p>RCGD staff member Johari Hunt also introduced the RCGSD’s new mentorship program. Any interested student can apply to be a mentee, and faculty members are encouraged to volunteer as mentors. Students can find more information on the RCSGD website or Facebook page.</p>\n<p>All students are also welcome to stop by the RCSGD centers or contact Ogui Gonzalez at <em>ogui.gonzalezvila@sa.ucsb.edu</em> for more information about upcoming opportunities.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Mernin’s full name is Hikaru Erza Mernin, not Erza Mernin as previously stated. </em></p>\n<p><i>Correction: Dumlao is the RCSGD diversity education facilitator, not the RCSGD office manager as previously stated. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Some lost friends and others were stranded south of the freeway closure, forced to rely on alternate forms of transportation to reach campus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TRAPPED</strong></p>\n<p>While many students fled the fires by going back to their hometowns, most faculty and staff did not have that option.</p>\n<p>“I went stir crazy,” said Janet Mizrahi, a professor in the writing department, in an email. “I continued to meet my goal of 10,000 steps daily by listening to an audiobook while I walked in circles in my small house! My dog thought I was nuts!”</p>\n<p>For Nomi Morris, another professor in the writing department who lives in Upper Ojai, the fire originated near Ojai and blazed through her neighborhood, giving her only a half an hour to gather her belongings. While her own street was spared, many houses in her neighborhood were destroyed.</p>\n<p>She first evacuated her home and came to Goleta with her family, until the unhealthy air quality pushed them to move further north and stay with a family friend.</p>\n<p>Some professors living in voluntary evacuation zones also had to leave their homes just before finals week. Many made their exams optional or changed them to take-home finals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TRANSPORTATION DIFFICULTIES</strong></p>\n<p>The mudslides in January also made it difficult for many faculty and staff to get to campus.</p>\n<p>Writing professor Ilene Miele was forced to drive through Ventura during the Thomas Fire until she ultimately decided to cancel class for a day because of the fire’s proximity to Route 101. For the past week, she has been taking the ferry to Santa Barbara, initially relying on a colleague to drive her to campus before learning about a UCSB shuttle service at the Santa Barbara Harbor.</p>\n<p>“What caused the most anxiety for me, at first, was not knowing how I would get there and make it to the first day of class,” Miele said in an email. “The first day they warned us to expect a rocky ride, but it was a fairly gentle roll … Overall, I was fortunate that we had good weather and the rides were fairly quick (an hour and a half each way).”</p>\n<p>Morris stayed in Santa Barbara for the first week of the quarter due to closed roads and classes that end too late for her to take a train back.</p>\n<p>According to Mary Ferris, executive director of Student Health Service, staff at Student Health also faced exceptional difficulty ensuring coverage with blocked roads and the recent flu outbreaks. Understaffing, combined with increased demand stretched the staff thin, resulting in longer hours.</p>\n<p>She said that because of the staff’s commitment to health, they went to extreme lengths to reach campus, with some staff staying overnight in Santa Barbara for the week. One pharmacist even flew to Santa Barbara from Oxnard in the morning.</p>\n<p>“Every day was a new challenge,” Ferris said. “When you’re in healthcare you can’t just close.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>EMOTIONAL IMPACT</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond physical losses, the constant evacuations and impacted schedules have taken an emotional toll on staff and faculty.</p>\n<p>“I managed to stay calm from day to day, but never quite sure when and if I would freak out,” Paul Sonnino, a professor in the history department, said in an email. “Haven’t yet, but the sense of uncertainty is taking its toll.”</p>\n<p>Mizrahi lost a close personal friend who was swept away by the mudslide.</p>\n<p>“Losing a contemporary is a devastating kind of loss — after all, it so easily could have been me,” she said in an email. “It’s emotionally devastating.”</p>\n<p>For Miele, her experiences being blocked from campus and driving through the fire have left her uncertain.</p>\n<p>“These days when I get on the 101, I think of it as the highway of doubt. Depending on the conditions, you’re never quite sure whether you’ll get there or if you’ll get home,” she said. “Much as I know we need the rain in Southern California, I’ll be glad when winter is over this year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>RETURNING TO CAMPUS</strong></p>\n<p>Some professors also faced backlash from students over the cancellation of classes and office hours.</p>\n<p>“Some insensitive students — just a couple — got very upset because I did not give them automatic ‘A’s as compensation for my having had to cancel some office hours since the fire was approaching my house,” Sonnino said in an email.</p>\n<p>Other professors greatly enjoyed returning to campus, with students expressing concern for their well-being.</p>\n<p>“It was a relief to see young people, you know, hear the regular questions, and I’m enjoying my students immensely,” Mizrahi said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UNIVERSITY RESPONSE</strong></p>\n<p>Under the difficult circumstances, many praised the university for offering financial assistance through a special fund for faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Some, however, have raised concerns about the speed at which UCSB made decisions.</p>\n<p>“As a faculty member I had the flexibility to cancel classes when I thought it was unsafe, but I know that staff members did not necessarily have that same flexibility,” Miele said. “So, while I understand that there are many complexities involved, I have concerns about the university’s ability to respond more quickly.”</p>\n<p>Despite the financial assistance, the experience has been challenging for those who were blocked by the roads.</p>\n<p>“The university has been terrific, but it is draining, it is stressful [and] it is harder to work. We’re all doing our best,” Morris said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>LOOKING BACK</strong></p>\n<p>Overwhelmingly, faculty and staff echoed the same sentiment — things could have been worse.</p>\n<p>“I just continually have this feeling that I got off easy,” said Morris, grateful that she still has her home, despite the lingering smell of smoke. “I just really want to make this clear that compared to what the people in Montecito are going through, I went through nothing.”</p>\n<p>Sonnino echoed similar sentiments, saying that compared to tragedies around the world, losing utilities at his house or a nearby bridge shattering are insignificant.</p>\n<p>“It only made me aware of how much worse off are people in Aleppo, Israel, Palestine, Puerto Rico, Seoul and other places who live under imminent threat day in and day out,” he said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>MOVING FORWARD</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone copes with tragedy in different ways.</p>\n<p>Assistant professor Leah Stokes was pushed into action after a frustrated tweet about climate change garnered positive responses.</p>\n<p>Her op-ed in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, titled “Climate Change in my Backyard,” addresses the impact of climate change on recent climate disruptions, and acts as a “call to action,” urging people to focus more on environmental policy.</p>\n<p>“You just need one degree of separation to meet someone affected by this,” Stokes said. “My op-ed is about changing people’s minds, about how we talk about these events.”</p>\n<p>She hopes that people will speak out and influence others to understand that blaming Montecito residents for not evacuating is simple. Instead, she said, people need to understand the greater causes behind the devastation.</p>\n<p>Others focused on philanthropy and helping their community. Morris personally raised over $3,000 for two people who she knew were in need.</p>\n<p>For Mizrahi, the loss of her friend has pushed her to embrace the present.</p>\n<p>“For me, it just made me focus on right now and living,” she said. “It’s like I got a fire built under my butt … I’m not waiting, I’m not waiting, I’m just doing it now — because who knows what tomorrow will bring?”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

A county permit calls for the disposal of some 300,000 cubic yards, which is the equivalent of 30,000 dump truck loads.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident that the vast majority of the material is just sand and sediment from the mountains and creeks,” said Santa Barbara Channelkeeper (SBCK) Watershed and Marine Program Director Ben Pitterle. “In Montecito, certainly there was structural debris and some hazardous waste that was mixed into that.”</p>\n<p>The mud disposed of at Goleta Beach is currently being analyzed in a local laboratory for heavy metals, organic compounds that are byproducts of wildfires and aquatic toxicity that can harm ecology.  Results of those tests will not be available until later this week.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the impacts, obviously if it wasn’t for retention basins, bridges, creeks, etc., much of the sediment would’ve found its way to the beach in Montecito, under natural circumstances,” Gira said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Flood Control conducted an initial screening of the debris and the contaminated soil is being bypassed by the central landfills.</p>\n<p>Gira said local beaches were heavily eroded by the 2015-2016 El Niño season, so the sediment can be seen as a “real treasure,” because white sand beaches are naturally formed from catastrophic flows, floods and fires, along with the sediments they produce.</p>\n<p>This is a chance for a counterpoint the mud effects, Gira said, since the sediment offsets the ongoing erosion.</p>\n<p>“The county is doing its best to get as much of the sediment as possible into a littoral cell,” he continued. “And when put on Goleta Beach, it’ll work its way down the coast, feeding all the beaches from Santa Barbara to Ventura.”</p>\n<p>Littoral cells are natural compartments on a coastline that complete cycles of sedimentation. These cycles sort through finer material like ash, which is carried away and deposited at the bottom of the ocean, while sand is retained on the beach.</p>\n<p>“So, it’s a tradeoff,” Gira said. “So far, we don’t know about any obvious water quality impacts. Every measure in an emergency has been taken to prevent them. My understanding is that S.B. County Flood Control is also going to implement sediment quality monitoring of some type.”</p>\n<p>The SBCK has done daily tests for fecal indicators of waters in disposal sites as well as local beaches like Campus Point at UCSB and Rincon Beach in Carpinteria. Santa Barbara County has conducted its own testing as well.</p>\n<p>Pitterle said that as of last week, the county was no longer testing for contaminants. The testing was limited to visual monitoring for larger debris like wood or structural material, which is then deposited at different locations, including Ventura County.</p>\n<p>Wildfires can affect the soil and water chemistry by decreasing nutrient concentrations, such as nitrogen.</p>\n<p>“So you can end up with algae blooms in subsequent years and we may see some of that,” said Pitterle, referring to how the recent Thomas Fire triggered the mudslides by altering the landscape.</p>\n<p>“I think what people are really worried about right now is the mud and toxicity — we just don’t have any answers yet,” Pitterle said, “Certainly, there are bacteria tests showing positive results for contamination, so we [SBCK] and county city officials are recommending that people stay out of the water at those beaches.”</p>\n<p>Pitterle said the bacteria results are improving near Campus Point and the water quality has met standards in the last couple of days.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking now for officials to address the muds being deposited on shore in other watersheds along roads or on other properties,” said Pitterle. “We definitely want to make sure that agencies are implementing what they call ‘best-management practices.’”</p>\n<p>The SBCK is ensuring containment of mud runoff. That way, during the next storm, new creeks and waterways will not be contaminated with that material.</p>\n<p>“A lot of it’s getting transported — I’ve heard as far west as Buellton. It’s in new areas that weren’t even impacted by the fire. We want to make sure those areas stay unimpacted,” Pitterle said.</p>\n<p>Limited resources and testing expenses have been obstacles for SBCK when sampling beach disposal sites. Road closures have also made certain areas inaccessible.</p>\n<p>“We are trying our best to balance our environmental concerns, many of which are valid with also the status of rescue efforts and emergency response that were necessary at the time,”  Pitterle said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article was corrected to clarify that heavy metals are not organic compounds, as the article previously stated due to an editing error.

All water activities such as swimming and surfing and are highly discouraged.</p>\n<p>Eight beaches in Santa Barbara County were closed. Bacteria levels are lower than they were when tested last week and six more beaches have been opened, including Sands Beach at Coal Oil Point. Goleta, Carpinteria and Hope Ranch beaches remain closed.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Public Health Department is unsure of how much untreated sewage and chemical contamination is in the water because of the devastating effects of the Thomas Fire and significant amounts of rain, according to a press release on Wednesday. The agency is urging the public to avoid contact with any sand or water that looks or smells unusual.</p>\n<p>In an “abundance of caution” and to help with recovery, the department is also urging the public to stay out of the 400-foot buffer zone on each side of the beach where sediment from the mudflows is being deposited . The buffer zone is clearly marked with orange fencing.</p>\n<p>Ocean water will continue to be tested for microbial contaminants until the beaches are determined to be safe. While there has been significant improvement since last week, it is still unclear when the beaches will be reopened.</p>\n<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, coliforms are bacteria generally not considered harmful towards humans. However, increased amounts of coliforms can be indicators of other bacteria, viruses and parasites generally known as pathogens that can cause illness.</p>\n<p>Susan Klein-Rothschild, deputy director of the Santa Barbara Public Health Department, said that this bacteria is generally filtered out through the soil, but that their presence in the water could indicate the presence of sewage waste or feces.</p>\n<p>Beaches in Goleta, Carpinteria and Hammond had more than double the state health standard of coliform, with the rest of the beaches coming in under the standard.</p>\n<p>According to Klein-Rothschild, the amount of coliform was too high to be counted, which was a cause for “serious concern.”</p>\n<p>According to the Center for Disease Control, enterococci are generally found in the bowel and can be collected from water and vegetation generally as a result of contamination from untreated sewage.</p>\n<p>While the standard for enterococcus contamination is 104 MPN, water tests at Goleta Beach show over 24,000 MPN. This is more than 200 times the acceptable limits. In Carpinteria, enterococcus is lower, but still 10 times the acceptable limit.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t go in that water, and I wouldn’t want anyone I care about to go in that water either,” Klein-Rothschild said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Many experienced lung problems from the smoke and ash in the air. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was horrific,” said Darren Schmitt, a 46-year-old homeless local. Schmitt regularly sleeps on a cushion behind Embarcadero Hall, tucked in a corner out of sight of the students passing by.</p>\n<p>When the air quality in I.V. plummeted in the wake of the Thomas Fire, most students fled the neighborhood for their permanent residences. Schmitt stayed on the streets.</p>\n<p>“I watched ash drop all night here,” he said. “Everyone else was wearing [the masks], but I didn’t, so I felt like puking.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, a group of good Samaritans handed him a mask. But Schmitt, uninformed of just how bad the air had gotten, didn’t feel like wearing the mask all day. Believing his mask to not be fully effective, he discarded it.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, volunteer chaplain at the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office, said events like these are far more than unfortunate for the “house-less” of I.V. — they’re life-threatening.</p>\n<p>“You take someone who’s got respiratory problems to begin with — many of them are smokers — and it’s desperation,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>Some of those seeking shelter experienced asthma attacks, coughing and hacking as they finally arrived to an environment with cleaner air.</p>\n<p>Others suffer from lung-related ailments like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or emphysema. Hedges himself felt pain in his lungs, he said, though he had a home to return to.</p>\n<p>Homeless locals are allowed entry to a Warming Center at the University United Methodist Church on Camino Del Sur. Those straying in can receive dinner and blankets.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been doing this for 10 years, serving our community and making sure our friends without a home have a place to go to when it’s cold and wet outside,” said Ed Wesson, operational manager for the Freedom Warming Centers of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Warming Center opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 6:00 a.m. the next day. At that time, Schmitt said, those who stayed overnight are told to leave, regardless of the weather outside.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s pouring rain,” Schmitt said. “We’re sent out onto the street.”</p>\n<p>In the case of last week’s rainfall, Schmitt escaped to an underground garage in Goleta and hid until the storm cleared.</p>\n<p>“When rain like that comes, we get wet, and all our stuff gets wet,” added another local, who would identify himself only as Jeffrey.</p>\n<p>For decades of living in I.V., Jeffrey has made money by fishing at Goleta Beach and collecting recyclables. Days of heavy rain get in the way of his ability to fish, leaving him with little recourse for money.</p>\n<p>Not all the homeless despaired under the conditions. Another local, who gave his name only as Danny, scoffed at the idea that he was under distress.</p>\n<p>“We live our lives outdoors and fight through everything,” Danny said. “Rain and fire don’t scare me.”</p>\n<p>Each spring, the Central Coast Collaborative on Homeless (C3H) releases an annual census on nationwide homelessness. The 2017 account, published in March, found a population of 26 homeless I.V. locals, the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/\">reported</a>. Multiple homeless people said they were suspicious of the figure, agreeing that it felt too low. Hedges refuted the number altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe what happened with that,” Hedges said. “I know the numbers, and the count was just wrong.”</p>\n<p>If census-takers wanted to get an accurate homelessness count, Hedges said, they could attend free dinners served by local churches. When the 2010 census was taken, he rallied homeless people to sign up. If people were to stand up and be counted, Hedges said, it would make for a telling political statement.</p>\n<p>“If you stand up for a census,” he said, “it says, ‘Here I am — you’ve got to count me, I exist. Now deal with me.’”</p>\n<p>If the “powerful” were to know the extent of the problem, he said, there could one day be a difference.</p>\n<p>With the weather cleared, the homeless are free to go about their days on the I.V. streets. Some roam on their bicycles, others hang out at a stone bench on Pardall Road that they’ve dubbed “the bedrock.” Schmitt and Jeffrey sit on the ground at Anisq’Oyo Park and share a jar of peaches. When he reflects on the past month’s trying conditions, Jeffrey is animated but maintains that it doesn’t faze him.</p>\n<p>“We do have a home,” he said, lying horizontally on the ground and tucking his backpack beneath his head. “All of us out here depend on each other.”</p>\n<p>He travels light, but does carry a cardboard sign he likes to show I.V. residents walking by. It boldly reads, “Refuse to have a bad day.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 18 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/","id":4334,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4333,4332,4331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sexual Assault Reported in UCSB Student Housing","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-01-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/campus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/campus.jpg?resize=740%2C325&ssl=1","description":"A UC Santa Barbara student reported an attempted sexual assault on Monday in her room at on-campus student housing, according to a university alert sent out Thursday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A UC Santa Barbara student reported an attempted sexual assault on Monday in her room at on-campus student housing, according to a university alert sent out Thursday evening.</p>\n<p>The suspect allegedly “refused to leave the victim’s room,” the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) said in the alert.

contained to I.V. He hopes to later open a permanent location, but for now frequents street corners in Isla Vista. Stephan Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Camacho needs to provide proof of insurance to resume selling on campus, according to the Office of Student Life (OSL). OSL has recommended an insurance provider and has contacted Camacho to ask about his progress towards meeting the school’s requirements.</p>\n<p>The insurance required by the university needs to cover up to $2 million in liability, which is a monthly payment Camacho says he cannot afford.</p>\n<p>Days before Fall Quarter began, Camacho learned that he and other off-campus vendors would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/\">no longer be allowed</a> to sell on campus because the vendors’ sales violate Environmental Health and Safety policies regarding vendors unaffiliated with the university.</p>\n<p>OSL<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/elotero-could-return-to-srb-soon-pending-permits/\"> later clarified</a> the requirements needed for off-campus vendors to sell on campus. Camacho explained, however, that he would not be returning to the campus because the costs of the required permits and insurance would outweigh the benefits of selling one day of the month or even one day out of the week.</p>\n<p>Camacho sold in Isla Vista throughout Fall Quarter, even while Santa Barbara was under “hazardous” air quality due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a> during December.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cuando tengo contracto con los estudiantes tengo que venir, sea lluvia o calor.</em>”</p>\n<p>“When I have a contract with the students, I have an obligation to come, rain or shine,” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>Camacho situates his canopy on Pardall Road and alternates between Isla Vista street corners, where the traffic provides more opportunity for sales.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80412\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"977929887\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80442\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80412\" data-attachment-id=\"80412\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/high-insurance-costs-prevent-el-elotero-from-selling-on-campus/hijinio-by-stephan-manga-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1274&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1274\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hijinio by Stephan Manga ONLINE-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C565&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-80412\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1-1024x652.jpg?resize=888%2C565\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C652&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephan Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Camacho’s business is currently registered as a business within California, and he is in the process of finalizing the permits that would allow him to sell on Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>County regulations require temporary food facilities to provide a cleaning station, use only prepackaged foods and clearly display permits and other paperwork.
