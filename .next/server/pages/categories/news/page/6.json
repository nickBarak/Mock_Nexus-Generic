When the campus was still open, another group of researchers in the Materials Department made batches of hand sanitizer for community use. And presently, professors across campus are developing a coronavirus test that would be simpler and faster than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coronavirus test.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Face Shield Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in the CNSI lab, Magnuson and David Bothman, the organizer behind the face shield production, work opposite shifts to keep the 3D printer running to produce as many parts as possible for the face shields. The shields, which are meant to go over medical goggles and face masks, consist of a transparent shield, headband and strap, all based off a </span><a href=\"https://budmen.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">design created by a 3D printer manufacturer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By early April, the team had created and delivered 40 face shields to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and had 40 more ready for delivery. But the hospital’s needs are “tremendous,” said Bothman, who normally lectures on mechanical engineering at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hospital needs 10,000 shields of the style we’re making. We can make, you know, 20 or 30 a day … but it’s clear that a lot of other people and people with a lot more manufacturing capability are going to need to be involved,” Bothman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other groups on campus have joined in the production of face shields, including Roger Green, manager at the chemistry and biochemistry machine shop. He and Andy Weinberg, the machine shop superintendent, obtained enough materials to make 3,000 face shields. The two had finished cutting the clear plastic covers for 200 shields with a 3D printer in early April and with the help of a couple more people in the production process, Green said his team would likely soon be able to produce about 200 clear plastic covers a day.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hand Sanitizer Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over in the Materials Department, Assistant Professor Angela Pitenis had been worrying about the coronavirus pandemic early on. Before </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB canceled in-person classes on March 10</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, she cut the normal lesson plans she had for her graduate class, Colloids and Interfaces,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and instead presented on the colloidal formation and stability properties of hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking notice of the rising anxiety over coronavirus among the students in her class, she decided to dedicate a lecture to demonstrate how to make basic hand sanitizer. Then she had the idea to produce hand sanitizer for the entire campus community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This whole project really began as a truly class exercise to demonstrate basic principles, but it also links back to the work that we do every day in materials science,” Pitenis said. “I think it was a very good lesson for the students to be able to see how lessons in the classroom can translate to practical engineering solutions, especially in response to COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining forces with colleagues Rachel Segalman, Raphaële Clément, Craig Hawker, Christopher Bates and Michael Chabinyc, all professors in the UCSB Materials Department, the group pooled together their reagents to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in their labs for community usage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basically, any kinds of solutions we could find, we would put them together,” Pitenis recalled. She said she isn’t sure how much hand sanitizer they made altogether, but she estimates “gallons.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Segalman’s lab members, chemical engineering doctoral student Audra Destefano, came up with the creative idea to design a label and call their hand sanitizer “Universal Corona Sanitizing Balm.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The name], which was very clever … really encapsulated the efforts we were trying to do here, which was to support our community,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scientists distributed their hand sanitizer around campus, including among their shared facilities, the Materials Research Lab and the CNSI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the hand sanitizer went directly to those shared facilities to support students and staff at the time who were still having to use those shared facilities to maintain their critical research, and also to support our staff, who might not have time in between experiments to wash their hands,” Pitenis described.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Pitenis emphasized handwashing over hand sanitizer, noting that it is more effective and a practice that the CDC </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/pdf/hand-sanitizer-factsheet.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommends</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since campus operations, including most research labs, have shut down, Pitenis and her colleagues have ceased their hand sanitizer production, for now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’ve made enough to support the needs of our community,” she remarked, adding that if there was a need for more, her team could always produce additional hand sanitizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’re all trying to help out as much as we can; I think this is a total team effort right now. And I’m just incredibly amazed and I’m just humbled by the efforts of my colleagues,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><b>Coronavirus Test Development </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across campus, four professors from the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) are working tirelessly to develop a coronavirus test that would be faster and easier to use and would not “rely on the common reagents that the rest of the world is scrambling to get,” said Max Wilson, an assistant professor in the MCDB department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson, Carolina Arias, Diego Acosta-Alvear and Kenneth Kosik all know each other from teaching and working together in the MCDB department, but as the coronavirus pandemic tore through U.S. communities and the lack of available testing became more obvious, the group stepped up to help fill the gap in resources and information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw that there was a massive need for testing and we decided that we would use our labs and our skills as molecular biologists to help,” Wilson said. “We were all scientists studying other things before this. We dedicated funds from [other projects] to develop this because we saw how important it was.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the CDC’s test as a benchmark for accuracy, the team created a test for coronavirus that uses an enzyme similar to the family of enzymes used in a CRISPR test, a method that </span><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/coronavirus-test-crispr-mammoth-biosciences/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scientists around the nation have already begun to tap into</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that targets repetitive DNA sequences. This test uses the enzyme to recognize the presence of the coronavirus viral genome and indicates a positive or negative result on a lateral flow dipstick, a testing device similar to those used for pregnancy tests, according to Wilson.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the beginning of April, the group was tinkering with adjustments to the test to make it cheaper and easier to use. The professors also began looking into the process of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, which is currently being fast tracked for coronavirus tests but could still likely take months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s gonna be a long way, unfortunately,” Arias said. “We are still far. I don’t want to give anybody false expectations or false hope </span>that we’re going to have something that can be deployed tomorrow. It is a process [that requires] approval.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to developing a new coronavirus test, the professors </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also donated enough critical reagents, an essential component in the current CDC coronavirus test, for 600 tests to the Cottage Health laboratory, the Santa Barbara Independent </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/04/02/ucsb-molecular-biologists-to-the-rescue/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arias’ role in the project has been to coordinate approval processes and navigate protocols for the research to take place. Besides that, she also teaches general animal virology to a class of 185 students remotely –– a task faced by UCSB’s entire teaching faculty and one they had a mere </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-24/pandemic-pedagogy-faculty-prepares-for-first-quarter-of-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two weeks to prepare for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> –– and serves on UCSB’s COVID-19 Response Working Group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And we have families so we don’t stop. If it’s not one thing, it’s another one,” Arias said. “I cannot even tell you at what time [the day] begins or what time it ends.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the researchers are propelled by an extreme sense of urgency to find solutions and provide information to the public, a collective effort they “hope is going to be significant” in the community’s fight against coronavirus, Arias said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the team is discussing the possibility of using their coronavirus test in a research project that would focus on the prevalence of coronavirus in asymptomatic patients. The project could reveal information about how the virus spreads, but until the test is FDA approved, patients involved in the project would not be able to know the results of the testing, Wilson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While much remains uncertain about the timeline of their projects and the future in general, Wilson, Arias, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acosta-Alvear and Kosik are steadfast in their mission to help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people might feel helpless and I just want to reassure them that many of the best scientists I know are working as hard as they possibly can to come up with solutions that will ease the pain on this pandemic,” Wilson said. “There are things coming.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

He did not specify how much the IVTU expects to receive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EVPLA Christian Ornelas said in an email that his office has “set aside about $3-4k should [IVTU] need more money,” and that “The uncertainty of this whole situation has put people in a tough spot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside the IVTU, institutions throughout I.V. and the UCSB community have worked to abate the economic blow that the coronavirus crisis has dealt to students. The UCSB Graduate Student Association created a coronavirus relief </span><a href=\"https://gsa.ucsb.edu/covid19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the A.S. Senate recently allocated </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$80,000</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to student financial relief groups, including the Financial Crisis Response Team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While IVTU’s emergency fund does not cover lease payments, the financial burden for many students comes from monthly rent payments to which they are </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contractually bound</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even if they left I.V. to return to their hometowns.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said that although he no longer lives in I.V., he still has to pay $800 a month in rent for a four-bedroom home with eight other people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students signed leases in January for housing in I.V., but IVTU lawyer Robin Unander said she is concerned that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a UCSB remote fall quarter, which would “not leave great options” for the students who have already signed their 2020-21 housing contracts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, for those without leases going that far ahead, Unander said that it could lead to a housing crunch where rental prices increase due to the massive, immediate demand for housing.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During [fall], there’s not very many rentals left. And there’s a lot of students; if we’ve got a lot of people [securing housing in the fall], this could get really, really complicated,” Unander said.</span></p><div

For most, a year with that level of responsibility and amidst the party politics of A.S. is enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one year later, Beasley shows no signs of slowing down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Beasley ran for the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position, the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">endorsed his opponent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Alexandra Leal Silva, largely due to her three years of experience working in the office in comparison to Beasley, who was an outsider to A.S. at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as we noted in our endorsement of Leal Silva at the time, both she and Beasley were confident, charismatic and genuine leaders who seemed to sincerely care about the well-being of UC Santa Barbara students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley is facing two opponents in this year’s election: third-year sociology major Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who is running with the Isla Vista Party, and second-year cell and developmental biology major Austin Foreman, who is running as an independent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Foreman is not suited for the position of president. It became clear in speaking to him that while he is passionate about what he does, he lacks the tangible experience needed to serve as a representative for the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, he seems to lack a wider understanding of university and any tangible experience outside of A.S. When pressed about his experience and platform points, he faltered, and often talked in circles while failing to explain how he would feasibly pursue them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest reasons Foreman gave for running is that he wanted to work on improving the retention of A.S. career staff. While this is an admirable goal, it should not be the reason a student runs to be A.S. president, a position that is meant to serve all students, not just those within A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe that Foreman — who has introduced numerous resolutions focused on helping his fellow students over the past year while serving as an on-campus senator — would have been better off pursuing the position of Internal Vice President. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regard to Segura-Esquivel, the Nexus believes the third-year student is incredibly capable of being the next A.S. president, if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the three hours in which we spoke to him, it became clear he has acquired the wide range of knowledge needed to be this campus’ A.S. president and that his passion for students is nearly unmatched. He stressed that his identity as a “brown, queer, first generation, low-income student” has allowed him to be at the forefront of campus issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of his platform points — centered around helping students with basic needs as well as establishing emergency protocols — are not particularly innovative, as they echo ones proposed both this year and the year before by candidates running for A.S. positions. But Segura-Esquivel, refreshingly, was able to back up his platform points with detailed plans for accomplishing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, during our interview, Segura-Esquivel often went on tangents and strayed far from the question at hand. While we appreciated his enthusiasm, his answers brought into question his ability to effectively communicate on behalf of students to administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley, in comparison, was an approachable candidate who was able to get his point across easily, which assured us of his ability to do the same with both the average student and administrator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, in any other election year, Segura-Esquivel would be the clear choice for our endorsement. But due to Beasley’s year of executive experience and his extensive history of advocacy for UCSB students, the Nexus chose Beasley for our endorsement, with the firm belief that he would be the best president for our campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As EVPSA, Beasley seemingly worked tirelessly to help advocate on behalf of students; the EVPSA is a unique position within A.S., involving extensive lobbying and traveling between D.C. and Sacramento. In addition to serving as EVPSA, Beasley is also a resident assistant this year. His ability to balance the two intensive time commitments while taking classes is certainly impressive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with these hurdles, Beasley helped bring to fruition </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-28/uc-gains-4-million-in-funding-for-summer-financial-aid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10 million in summer financial aid</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for students through his role with the Coalition for a Better UC and countlessly lobbied on behalf of UCSB students as EVPSA, speaking repeatedly to both UC administrators, including UC President Janet Napolitano, and elected officials in California and Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his interview with the Nexus, Beasley made clear his vast knowledge of the campus, speaking extensively to both his history with the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Student Union demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as advocating against </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty Meter Telescope Project at Mauna Kea</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which the UC helps fund. He noted that he hopes to continue both projects if elected president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of Beasley’s platform points fall under two categories, he explained in his interview: access and advocacy. He wants to continue current A.S. President Alison Sir’s projects, including her </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-18/proposed-vending-machine-in-i-v-aimed-at-addressing-food-insecurity-in-near-future/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vending machine project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — a project aimed at providing food to low-income students — as well as finding a permanent location for the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-15/committee-moves-forward-with-plans-for-permanent-a-s-bike-shop/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bike shop</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, something also pursued by Sir’s predecessor, former A.S. President Brooke Kopel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of [Sir’s] goals were cut short by COVID … I definitely want to make sure that those projects have a home in my office and [are seen] through to completion,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that he also wants to focus on returning free night and weekend parking to students, who initially voted for </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/students-in-2003-voted-for-free-night-and-weekend-parking-sixteen-years-later-where-is-it/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“free” night and weekend parking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through a lock-in fee in 2003. But that “free” parking only lasted five years; now, if students want to park on campus during nights and weekends, they are required to purchase a $52.50 permit that lasts for three quarters. Beasley said he has already had a few conversations with Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) over this issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Foreman, Beasley also aims to make sure students have “adequate access” to mental health resources and know their options, if elected. He noted that “you never really know what you’re getting into when you go [to C.A.P.S.],” adding that “C.A.P.S. isn’t for everybody.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first went [to C.A.P.S.], there were no available Black psychologists. And when I asked for one, I kind of got laughed at. I ended up being able to go out into the community to find Acacia Health and Wellness,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to many executive candidates this year, Beasley hopes to establish a standardized emergency response protocol at the university. He explained that in his time at UCSB, he’s seen a gap between the administration and its students when times of emergencies struck, such as during the 2017 Thomas Fire and the current coronavirus pandemic. He noted that he had “countless meetings” with administrators to help address students’ needs before the coronavirus shut down the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that there needs to be more outreach between the administration and students in terms of advocacy, particularly on administrators’ parts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students are constantly having to go to [administrators’ doors] … ‘Can we have a meeting? Can we talk about this? Where’s the funding for Black students? Where’s the funding for Native American students?’ That shouldn’t have to be a recurring conversation,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Next year as president, I will make sure that administration is able to reach out to students and ask them what they need instead of the other way around,” he continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the Nexus believes that Beasley’s passion, combined with the relationships he already has with UC administration, gives him a leg up over anyone else. He has also shown the ability to adapt through his time in office, tacking on projects he hadn’t run on, like the TMT project, and turning them into major initiatives for his office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Beasley will use this tangible experience as EVPSA to his benefit if elected president; he has worked incredibly hard to highlight efforts that otherwise may have slipped through the cracks. He has proven time and time again over this year as EVPSA that he has the ability to advocate for change at the highest levels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected as the next president, the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that Beasley will not only continue the work he is already doing, but use his unique qualifications to truly listen to his constituents and go above and beyond to create tangible change on this campus.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot. We heard concerns about the portraits not accurately reflecting what the candidates look like and will actively work to ensure that this will not happen in the future.</em></p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds believes that her legislative, lobbying and leadership experience with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), among other organizations, gives her the edge over her Campus United opponent, Beau Karnsrithong, a second-year environmental studies and film and media studies double major. The Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both said in their endorsement interviews that they hope to take advantage of the lobbying process and fight for legislation that supports student needs, Karnsrithong has no personal lobbying experience and lacks his opponent’s fluency in drafting legislation and reviewing policy. This is imperative, as the duty of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) is to represent student needs on the UC, state and federal level through means such as lobbying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Karnsrithong struggled to answer basic questions about major student issues, including those about Title IX and even what the role of the EVPSA is. He did not seem to have any concrete platform points that he wanted to accomplish if elected, nor an understanding of what exactly an executive position demands of an individual. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankly, the Nexus does not believe Karnsrithong is a competitive candidate, particularly juxtaposed with Reynolds, who has done a lot of advocacy work outside of A.S. already. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus was impressed with the depth of Reynolds’ platform points, as her well-planned and thought-out approach makes achieving her goals more likely if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having worked on a number of bills with Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, the representative for Santa Barbara County in the State Senate, Reynolds’ legislative experience adds to her ability to advocate for student needs and would aid her in achieving her main goals as EVPSA: providing basic needs for all communities, providing equitable financial aid, increasing funding for mental health resources on campus, protecting survivors’ rights and lobbying for policies to diversify the UC Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Reynolds expanded her background with legislation and policy when she joined SASA as a policy analyst. There, she organized UC Santa Barbara students’ lobbying efforts against United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ proposed amendments to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the Department of Education is currently reviewing Title IX, Reynolds believes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“it’s extremely important that survivors, and all students who could potentially become survivors, are protected from regulations that could detrimentally change the course of their cases and their lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, she plans to make use of the EVPSA’s statewide advocacy platform and her lobbying experience to fight for survivors and “uphold Obama-era Title IX policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both agree that Title IX is not effective in its current form, Karnsrithong’s only experience with its policies come from his training as a resident assistant, and he was unable to speak specifically to what changes in Title IX policy needed to be made.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Reynolds does not have previous experience working inside the EVPSA office, she has worked closely with the office and Lobby Corps to host SASA’s first-ever Sexual Assault Awareness Month last April. During that month, she used her legislative experience to explain bills pertaining to sexual assault to students who signed up to lobby.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds became SASA’s president and UCSB director during her junior year. In her new roles, Reynolds worked to increase awareness about sexual assault and gender bias by organzing summits and town halls — many of which were scheduled to take place in April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and have now been canceled due to the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through her involvement with SASA, she also helped create Isla Vista’s first-ever </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-15/center-dedicated-to-helping-victims-of-sexual-violence-opens-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2019, the product of a partnership between the Isla Vista Community Services District and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds is also experienced with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Student Association, necessary for the role of EVPSA, who is required to meet with the UC president on behalf of the student body frequently. She currently serves as UCSB’s undergraduate representative to the Title IX Student Advisory Board. Altogether, her history of working directly with the UC Student Association and the UCOP speaks to her qualifications for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of basic needs, Reynolds plans to lobby for legislation that would push the UC to provide better mental health services for students. She also plans to expand the role of Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and the Campus Advocacy Resource &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E.) through increased funding and a “more diverse staff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also hopes to alleviate food insecurity by working with the A.S. Food Bank and lobbying for legislation that provides support to those who are food insecure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all fighting for these basic needs as college students. And there shouldn’t be the fact that we have to have certain communities fight harder for them,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds hopes to uplift marginalized groups by facilitating direct feedback from them but maintains that she would not speak on their behalf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think prioritizing not only marginalized communities that are very visible in the community, but also ones that may be less visible, like the undocumented students at UCSB, is important,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain transparency within the EVPSA office — something that Reynolds believes the current EVPSA, Daevionne Beasley, could have done better — she plans to hold town hall-style events where students can come together and hear about the work the EVPSA office is putting out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the nature of the EVPSA office’s budget, Reynolds wants to publicize the office’s expense reports, as “students should know exactly where their student fees are going.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at Reynolds’ work so far, it’s clear that as EVPSA, she would have the experience and drive to continue advocating for students, albeit with a much larger platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My passion for students’ needs and for elevating students’ voices is instrumental in this work,” she said. “I don’t think you can do this type of work without having that passion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had Karnsrithong waited an extra year to run for EVPSA and taken the time to hone the skills necessary for the role, he could have been a strong contender. But this year, that is not the case. For the 2020-21 EVPSA term, Reynolds’ qualifications speak for themselves, and the Nexus is certain that she’s the right candidate for the job. </span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot. We heard concerns about the portraits not accurately reflecting what the candidates look like and will actively work to ensure that this will not happen in the future.</em></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-94020\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Lea Toubian</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Toubian’s experiences working as a senator and with local campaigns in I.V., in addition to her specific goals if elected, have lent Toubian an advantage over her opponent, Yasamin Salari, who is running with the Isla Vista Party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that is not to say that Salari would not do well in the position — while Toubian has the edge, we believe that both candidates are incredibly qualified to serve as External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA). Our campus would be in good hands regardless of who is elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian’s platform focuses on increasing the I.V. community’s access to its local government and addressing student needs in times of crisis, which includes creating a cohesive emergency response plan that involves the university, the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and other organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Toubian aims to increase voter registration among both students and I.V. residents, develop proactive responses to sexual assault in I.V., hold landlords accountable for cliff erosion in I.V. and continue environmental projects such as the I.V. Compost Collective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Nexus does doubt the feasibility of Toubian’s goal to hold landlords accountable in addressing cliff erosion during her term as EVPLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian’s involvement with Campus Democrats her freshman year allowed her to embed herself in the community and foster personal connections with the I.V. CSD. She also worked as the external director of Associated Students Lobby Corps and was involved in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure R campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which secured funding for the I.V. CSD in 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Toubian served as both an on-campus senator and as the secretary of Campus Democrats. After she returned from studying abroad this year, she took a position as the chief of staff for current Internal Vice President Alli Adam. Toubian believes that her time working with the Senate has prepared her for the role of EVPLA, despite not having worked directly with the office before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to learn a lot about the communities that exist at UCSB. I had to learn about how to listen and uplift other people’s voices instead of putting mine ahead of them,” Toubian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of imparting my own biases on someone or a group of people, instead of speaking on behalf of people, [I learned] how to be the representative and actually uplift their voices using the platform that you’re given.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By working as chief of staff for Adam, Toubian said the position, along with her involvement in Campus Democrats, allowed her to stay connected with various groups on and off campus. Pulling from her experiences from Campus Democrats, she also sees voter registration for the upcoming November election as a priority for the office.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian also identified various issues around campus that she would like to address using the full power of the EVPLA office, including food insecurity, housing issues and sexual assault in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The benefit of having an office under you is that you could also specifically delegate people to make one issue or a small handful of issues their priority, which I think is a lot more effective than having one person try to tackle and say that they’re going to tackle every single issue,” Toubian said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re each able to tackle and be the spearheads for each issue and they can become experts on the topic. There are people who are passionate and most importantly, they’re people who have relevant experiences with that [issue],” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian also hopes to expand access to resources by widening normal outreach through Facebook and door-to-door canvassing, particularly for the non-student population in I.V., by providing translation services for non-English speakers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Toubian is receiving our endorsement, the Nexus believes that Salari would also do well in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari served as an on-campus senator on the 69th Senate but </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was removed in Winter Quarter 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for violating the eligibility requirement for the position, which states that on-campus senators must live amongst their constituents. In her interview with the Nexus, Salari cited financial issues as the reason she moved off campus and said that her work in the EVPLA office over the past few months inspired her to run for the position of EVPLA and improve it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari’s platform focuses on expanding on the university’s timely warning system to include any incidents of violence in I.V., not just on campus-associated property. She said she also hopes to work with Students Against Sexual Assault, Take Back the Night, the Title IX office and the Interfraternity Council to establish monthly meetings to assess the campus’ sexual assault climate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Toubian is well-versed in the I.V. CSD’s structure and its work, Salari had more tangible experience than Toubian in working directly with the I.V. CSD, as she currently serves as the I.V. CSD coordinator in the EVPLA office under Christian Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through this role, she became familiar with the projects of past EVPLAs, such as the police collaborative board, to address safety issues between students and police, a project she hopes to continue.

Senator Zion Solomon, who worked with Vice Chancellor for Students Affairs Margaret Klawunn to reduce the C.A.S.E. fee from $120 to $60, Perez wants to eliminate the fee altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Perez hopes to partner with pre-existing organizations, such as UCSB 4 COLA and the Isla Vista Tenants Union, and support the work they are doing on campus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> particularly through funding from her office, as opposed to creating more branches within the office to do that work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my biggest things is definitely giving back to the community, so sort of uplifting the voices that already exist instead of hijacking organizations, funding movements, offering resources that I know the office has the capacity to,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One criticism Perez pointed out about the work of this year’s S.A.G., Andrew Nguyen, and another issue she hopes to tackle if elected, is the lack of visibility of the OSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this current S.A.G. is doing a disservice to students by not being visible enough and [not] providing students the resources or the information,” she said. Perez hopes to utilize social media — TikTok included — to reach newer students and make them aware of the resources at their disposal, should they ever need them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In comparison to her opponent, Ferguson, Perez did not accomplish as much during her senate term. But ultimately, Ferguson seemed like a candidate who was more focused on the internal aspects of A.S., whereas Perez seemed to focus on reaching outward and impacting more of the student body, which is key to serving as S.A.G.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked why she believed she was the best candidate for the position, Perez recounted a memory from her first year of helping her roommate appeal her academic probation and get her financial aid back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think my experiences inside and outside the university allow me to bring a very unique perspective to this office,” Perez said. “I would hope to be able to provide a safer space for first-gen, low-income students of color to ask for help with the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who has advocated for herself and for those around her for the past few years, Perez is well-suited to advocate for all UCSB students as S.A.G.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

In the position, she is responsible for sending out weekly agendas, leading meetings when the IVP isn’t present and meeting with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m knowledgeable about how exactly to create an agenda, what goes onto the agenda, how to effectively create it and run the Senate meeting,” White said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen what goes into [being] Internal Vice President and I know what I can do to make it better, to make senators’ Senate time and Senate meetings more effective.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White’s ideas aren’t groundbreaking, but the Nexus chose her because we believe she is the most qualified of the two candidates — based on Senate experience — and is the only candidate with the firm ability to effectively lead weekly Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White’s opponent, fourth-year feminist studies major and current A.S. Senator Racquel Almario, brings extensive experience to the position as the current Finance and Business Committee chair, controlling the Senate’s budget and allotting funds to organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almario has done a substantial amount of work over the year during their senate term as Finance and Business chair, and they are always prepared to explain any budgetary requests to fellow senators when called upon. However, in their interview, Almario failed to elaborate on the details of their plans for the position of IVP and how they intended to execute them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Almario lacked enthusiasm and strong public speaking skills, which we believe are essential to chairing Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A concern of the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prior to our endorsement interview was that White would only continue the work started by Adam because of their close working relationship. But White wasn’t afraid to be critical of the ways that Adam didn’t fully measure up. </span></p>\n<p>White pointed out that one problem of Adam’s 70th Senate was poorly attended senator trainings.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the year there were supposed to trainings that senators were supposed to complete. I believe we’re supposed to complete seven out of the 14 trainings and a lot of them just did not get done. We had a lot of issues with getting senators to go to the trainings,” White said.</p>\n<p>White said that these required trainings were “not consolidated and it was not as organized as it could be” this past year. She plans to implement a system to begin senators’ trainings during the Declaration of Candidacy (D.O.C.) period of elections instead of after senators are sworn into office.</p>\n<p>“It’s having senators knowledgeable and ready to work from day one, from D.O.C., so that when they do get elected, they can just start doing what they want to do from the moment they win that position, from the moment they’re sworn in, instead of having to wait and having all these confusing trainings in the middle of the fall that people ultimately didn’t end up attending.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change wouldn’t go into effect until the 72nd Senate, as the D.O.C. period is prior to the election, but White said she plans to hold trainings as soon as new senators are elected, so that the 71st Senate can hit the ground running in the fall when students will be back on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate as a whole has often faced problems of transparency, with many students unaware of what senators do on a weekly basis and how the Senate can benefit them, despite the fact that it controls close to $15 million in student fees. Different IVPs have introduced initiatives year-to-year to address the lack of overall visibility, with varying success, and their ability to implement these plans plays a role in their overall success as IVP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White said that, if elected, she would publish weekly informational graphics on social media, listing which resolutions will be discussed that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key plan of White’s is using the Senate unallocated budget, a portion of the Senate’s funds reserved for organizations needing extra funding, to create an emergency fund for students navigating financial burdens due to the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These funds could be used by students to pay rent, break leases or rent storage units, and after the fund’s coronavirus-related needs are over, it would be converted into an A.S. emergency fund, to be used in times of crisis that affect the entire campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this plan, White intends to reach out to the UCSB Alumni Association to create an endowment and also wants to connect with potential donors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White did not fully answer how her plan is different from the work already being done by the Financial Crisis Response Team (FCRT), which is designed to help students financially in situations like the coronavirus or the 2017 Thomas Fire. When asked to clarify, she said she believes the organization’s work is only on an individual basis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a red flag that White lacked a deep understanding about the FCRT, which would be crucial to implementing what is her top platform point. But the IVP, more so than any other executive position, is more focused on internal operations than directly impacting students through new initiatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both White and Almario were senators this year, each with leading roles within the senate, as first pro-tempore and Finance and Business Committee chair, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the term, Almario authored four resolutions, compared to White’s 17. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, this was a decision not made lightly by the Nexus, as Almario brings extensive A.S. experience and some great platform points to the table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almario said that, if elected, they plan to move required trainings online, helping to ensure that all senators are trained while not requiring scheduled appointments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almario also wants to create a senate bill tracker, which is far more comprehensive in ensuring accountability compared to White’s weekly update plan. We would hope that White would implement some of these initiatives if elected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the Nexus believes that White has the ability to lead a unified Senate, not two separate parties refusing to work across the aisle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White is not a perfect candidate, but Almario’s interview made clear that they did not have the same ability to control the Senate room, which, in the end, is paramount to the success of the IVP. The IVP needs to be a force of leadership, someone who is not afraid to stand up and keep people in line. With this crucial requirement in mind, the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that White is the best fit for the job. </span></p>\n<p><em>[Update 10:16 p.m.]: This article has been updated to better reflect White’s critiques of Adam. </em></p>\n<p><em>[Update] The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot. We heard concerns about the portraits not accurately reflecting what the candidates look like and will actively work to ensure that this will not happen in the future.</em></p><div

Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Henry T. Yang announced the transition in an email to the student body on Monday afternoon, writing that the decision was made in consultation with students, staff and faculty and with the agreement of the Academic Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Summer Sessions staff previously told students in a campus-wide email on April 4 that a final decision regarding Summer Session A, which is scheduled to begin on June 22 and end on August 1, would be announced by April 17. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university has not made a decision on how it will conduct Summer Session B, which is scheduled to begin on August 3 and end on September 12, and concurrent sessions F and G, but said in the FAQ that a decision would be made by June 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang said in his email that it was likely that the later sessions would also be moved to remote instruction “if the State and County orders promoting physical distancing have not been revised.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the FAQ website, the university noted that specific lab and studio courses do not have remote alternatives, and that “it is critical that students who need these courses be given the opportunity to continue making degree progress in Summer if at all possible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Session B is also when we host our transition programs for incoming freshmen and transfer students, which have a strong community-building component that can best be delivered in person,” the FAQ website reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given the volatility of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the many unknowns, we would like to give the situation sufficient time to develop so that if there is any chance of safely hosting Session B in person, we can do so.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the university does switch to remote instruction for Session B, when programs such as the Freshman Summer Start Program and Transfer Edge are typically held, UCSB is “preparing to transition the programs to the virtual space.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are committed to providing a strong academic experience, access to helpful workshops and resources, and social and community-building activities for our incoming students,” the FAQ website reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Courses for Session A and concurrent sessions C, D and E will be held during their scheduled time slots, according to the FAQ. Currently, the university is moving forward as if all courses in Session B, F and G will be held in-person, but is preparing to switch to remote instruction if necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some summer courses are traditionally held online each summer, but with the transition to fully remote instruction, courses designed to be taught in-person will now have to be adjusted to online as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the FAQ, the university emphasized differences between online classes and remote instruction, describing online courses as ones that “have been specifically vetted, approved, and optimized for online learning,” while remote instruction is being used to describe classes that “were designed for in-person instruction, and are being adapted for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the transition to remote instruction for Session A, the university will not be offering campus housing to new students in June and July, according to the FAQ, but students currently living in campus housing will be allowed to stay during the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FAQ also pointed students toward residences in Isla Vista, where hundreds of students are currently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">subleasing their rooms</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after moving home for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Session B, Housing &amp; Residential Services is planning on offering its usual services, but is waiting on a final decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who sign up for summer housing will be able to cancel their contracts with no penalty if the university switches to remote instruction for Session B, according to the FAQ. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will still be virtually putting on its three pre-college programs, the Research Mentorship Program, the Summer Research Academies and the Summer Scholars Program, for high school students. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Comprised of business proposals and neighborhood compatibility ratings, the merit-based application is how Santa Barbara County plans to license its most qualified applicants, according to Gina Fischer, a representative from the 3rd District office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Fischer, the board of supervisors had originally planned to open a recreational dispensary application process in July 2o19 under a lottery system. But at an I.V. Community Network meeting in July, residents questioned the lottery system’s effectiveness; raffling away a license, Fischer said, opens the door to “a huge amount” of speculation about a retailer’s intentions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facing concern from her constituents, 3rd District Supervisor Joan Hartmann proposed a merit-based application in lieu of the county’s lottery system at the Board of Supervisors’ August meeting, Fischer said. There, the board voted 4 to 1 in favor of the new application.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One advantage of the merit-based application, which has already seen success in the cities of </span><a href=\"https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/business/license/cannabis/past_permit_solicitations.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.chulavistaca.gov/home/showdocument?id=18432\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chula Vista</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is that it spells out what the lottery system couldn’t: a way in which applicants can demonstrate in their applications that the needs of the community are a priority, Fischer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What do they do for the community? Are they a local business? Do they source locally?” Fischer asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applicants answer those questions in the form of a “community benefits package,” a portion of the application where prospective retailers showcase their community outreach and detail how their business operations would be tailored to the needs of residents, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The merit-based application will be scored in two parts. First, an independent third party contractor and “select county staff” will review and score each application, Fischer said; then in a second phase, county staff members will review each application for neighborhood compatibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The two scores will be combined for a rank-ordering. The highest ranked application in each area will have 90 days to complete its business license application,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county will then award one license to the top applicant in each of the county’s six “community plan areas”: Orcutt, Los Alamos, Santa Ynez, Eastern Goleta Valley, Isla Vista and a combined Summerland and Toro Canyon, according to the ordinance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each “community plan area” is appropriately zoned for a recreational cannabis storefront and takes “sensitive receptor areas,” such as schools, day cares and youth centers, into consideration through a 750-foot “zoning buffer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has a day care on campus. So the 750-foot boundary starts at the end of the light tunnel on Pardall and you would measure 750 feet [from there]. So any commercial zone and any commercial space within that buffer would be ineligible,” Fischer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the zoning buffer, another stipulation is that applicants must either own the unit they plan to turn into a storefront or have “written authorization from the owner to operate a cannabis operation at the site,” the ordinance read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because cannabis is still federally outlawed, applicants cannot partner with a business owner who is using a federally-backed bank lender for their commercial property. For the few units in I.V. that fall within the county’s commercial cannabis zone and are owned outright, Fischer said applicants were “promising [those property owners] the moon.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would bet my year’s salary that, within the zone that’s eligible, everybody who owns a commercial property has been approached by one dispensary or another, whether they’re local or far away,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the neighborhood compatibility scores are contingent on the county’s six neighborhood meetings, which were originally scheduled to take place through April and May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In light of social distancing restrictions, however, those meetings are postponed. And without them, the licensing process “cannot begin until the community meetings are completed,” said Barney Melekian, Assistant County executive officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We pulled the item from the Board agenda and won’t bring it back until we can provide an updated timeline,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jonathan Abboud, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) general manager, the I.V. CSD is focused on facilitating “the best possible public participation and figuring out what the community benefit should be from the dispensary” in I.V., such as donating to a local nonprofit. Beyond that, however, the I.V. CSD has been relatively uninvolved with the process, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The window for applicants to apply for a license will last one week and was originally slated to open sometime this July. But the timeline, including the application submission, review and scoring periods, will be delayed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Fischer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But far ahead of the scheduled deadlines, some recreational cannabis shops have their eye on the gold mine of Isla Vista, where the most successful applicant would have direct access to one of California’s </span><a href=\"http://www.usa.com/rank/california-state--population-density--city-rank.htm?hl=Isla+Vista&amp;hlst=CA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most densely populated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> areas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One applicant, </span><a href=\"https://www.coastaldispensary.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coastal Dispensary</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the City of Santa Barbara’s </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/09/21/coastal-cannabis-dispensary-opens-on-chapala/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> licensed storefront, has already held several meetings in Isla Vista to gauge the community’s atmosphere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Devon Wardlow, director of Public Affairs, and Myles Peck, director of Business Development, Coastal Dispensary is looking to its success as the City of Santa Barbara’s </span><a href=\"https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=213149\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highest-scoring</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> applicant as a model for its application to the county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are 100% invested in Isla Vista. Given that the CEO and the majority of our executive team all went to UCSB, this is a huge opportunity. And on a personal level, it really matters to us,” Wardlow said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cookies, a San Francisco-based dispensary that also expressed interest in having a storefront in I.V., did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In compliance with the ordinance, Coastal Dispensary has locked in an I.V. property that falls within the county’s commercial cannabis zone – located next to Buddha Bowls. Peck estimates that the roughly 4,000 square-foot storefront will staff about 20 employees and will run from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of aesthetics, Peck said that the I.V. storefront’s design would follow that of its predecessors and will feature an atmosphere that is “bright,” “open” and “clean.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the design is more than just aesthetics, Wardlow said. It also breaks down the idea that “‘Hey, this is a pot shop,’ to ‘this is a legitimate big-time business that is contributing to the economy in California across the board and to the local economy,’” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow maintained that Coastal Dispensary’s connection to the I.V. community is what sets their application apart from others. To bolster Coastal Dispensary’s “community benefits package,” Wardlow said she is enlisting the help of prominent community members, such as I.V. Food Co-op general manager Melissa Cohen and I.V. Foot Patrol Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Down the line, Wardlow added that she plans to partner with another five to seven community members from “different facets of Isla Vista” to gain additional input for the benefits package.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, Coastal Dispensary has held two different informational sessions in I.V., most recently in  </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-26/cannabis-professionals-search-for-community-opinions-on-possible-isla-vista-dispensary/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">February</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There, the dispensary fielded questions and concerns from residents about the prospect of a recreational cannabis storefront in town.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community benefits aside, Peck also said that the dispensary is working on a way in which it can tailor its products to the demographics of I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will cater our menu,” he said. “So for a student who is looking for a $2 or $1 joint, we’re going to carry more of that. A lot of stuff that will cater to what the college kids need will be in terms of budget and pricing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of price point, Wardlow maintained that every Coastal Dispensary product is sourced from regional growers within the state. But the allure of budget-friendly cannabis and lab-tested products may not be enough to entice students — who commonly purchase cannabis through unregulated means — to visit the store, Peck said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re going to be fighting that for a while,” he remarked. “Once you get experience with going in and buying stuff at a real shop — it’s convenient and it’s fast and it’s quick and it’s safe — you’re going to like it. That does start to drive home with the customer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Wardlow said Coastal Dispensary would carry over its cross marketing campaigns with neighborhood businesses, loyalty programs and discounts to the new store, all of which would be “more robust in I.V.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If their application is chosen, Wardlow said that Coastal Cares, the company’s employee community service program, would be “tailored specifically” to issues that are pertinent to the I.V. community, such as basic needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a contract with the City of Santa Barbara, the dispensary agreed to donate 2% of its profits back to the community; though a work-in-progress, Wardlow said she hopes to include something similar in her community benefits proposal to the county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You haven’t seen something like this where a brand new industry has the potential for massive economic changes for the state,” Wardlow said. “And I think that’s really exciting to be an operator in this situation because how we work is going to determine how successful this is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to keep Santa Barbara as the gold standard of retail cannabis.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Senate’s unallocated budget, which is not designated for spending on a specific topic. The fund, provided by students through campus fees, will have $88,688.30 left after the transfer to the Financial Crisis Response Team (FCRT) and Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) offices, according to the resolution. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was really important that we use some of our excess student fees that the students have paid into A.S. in the first place,” Ferguson said. “This is their money and it deserves to be going towards things that will be helping them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCRT, which helps students facing financial difficulties through a variety of services such as housing rent vouchers, will disperse the money among students who need it most based on the response team’s general review process, according to Rebecca Plotkin, the basic needs coordinator in the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and a member of the FCRT.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EOP provides </span><a href=\"http://eop.sa.ucsb.edu/services/grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S./EOP</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grants to students facing specific financial needs, such as medical costs, according to Aaron Jones, director of the EOP; he added that the EOP office currently has roughly $4,000 left for A.S./EOP grants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is no set date for the organizations to receive the money, Ferguson said he expects A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, who is directed by the resolution to transfer the funds, to do so “promptly.” After the FCRT and EOP distribute the funds, Marquez will write a report about how the money was spent and present it to the A.S. Senate, according to Ferguson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, the unallocated funds would be used to fund student groups or various projects. The bill’s second author, Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, said that because of the remote nature of spring quarter, the money would be best spent helping students who are reeling from the financial impact of the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of financial insecurity that people are facing, especially with a lot of them losing their jobs, losing out on income that they were expecting,” Segura said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the remaining money in the budget is for “emergency situations or just things … we don’t foresee that we can’t really plan ahead for.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/","id":1824,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1823,1822,1821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"University of California Announces No Intention To Adjust Tuition Fees","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tuition is set at a UC-wide level, and individual campuses do not have the authority to change it.

that students could stay connected, even as they moved away from campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He knew he would not be the only one disappointed by Chancellor Henry T.

So far, no one has broken any rules; they’re taking it seriously.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said that he aimed to have the server as precise as possible, having users follow a 1-meter-per-block scale and directing them to use Google Earth for measurements. Members of the Discord server have been sending pictures of buildings for references as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first completed structure was UCSB’s signature Storke Tower, soon followed by Storke Plaza, the UCen and the Arbor, said Neumann; the University Library is also in progress. Once campus construction is finished, the project will expand to rebuilding Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said his overall goal is to build the campus to such an accurate degree that when someone explores the completed server, it feels like the real deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Neumann, the server has been experiencing technical issues due to heavy traffic on the hosting site. With this being his first time running a large server, Neumann has been doing his best to keep members updated on the server’s status, actively posting announcements on the Discord and Facebook groups. Once the technical issues are resolved, Neumann hopes to incorporate a survival portion to the world, which includes player-versus-player elements, and hold weekend events within the server. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the quarter, Neumann said he is looking forward to celebrating a Minecraft graduation with everyone in the community. But for now, the main focus has been constructing the campus in creative mode, a feature that allows users to build freely with access to all the materials within the game, in addition to just spending time indoors and following the state’s stay-at-home order. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93901\" style=\"width: 1093px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-93901\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93901\" data-attachment-id=\"93901\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=1083%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1083,609\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-93901 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?w=1083&amp;ssl=1 1083w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93901\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Charles Neumann</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Montero, a third-year physics major and active member in the community, is responsible for starting the construction of the University Library and many other structures in the server.

However, all appointments have been transferred to virtual Zoom meetings, and 24-hour crisis hotlines remain active. In addition, the C.A.P.S. Mental Health Peer Program is “working on creating virtual Spring 2020 content” to give students an opportunity to connect with peers, according to its </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu\">website</a>.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, the RCSGD assured students that it would continue to provide them with resources to “support [students] during these trying times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We assure you that we will still have events and there will be ways to engage with the center and your LGBTQIA+ peers,” a representative from the RCSGD </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RCSGD.UCSB/posts/2592587471012681?__tn__=K-R\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said in a Facebook post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The post assured students that the RCSGD would be continuing to create spaces for LGBTQIA+ students, as well as linking basic needs resources from other departments.

It’s hard to see the social media posts, and I want to reply even if it isn’t to me, so if you have a concern, please reach out to me and I would be more than happy to talk about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the UCSB community, Ashlock offered a word of advice to those hesitant to use the new online services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seven billion of us are all facing things that we haven’t before.
