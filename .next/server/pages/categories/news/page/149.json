The young lady attempted to remain optimistic, yelling “we will have fun,” albeit while crying, in an attempt to rally her entourage of, well, no one.</p>\n<p>Despite her cheery outlook on the turn of events, fun was not on the agenda for the rest of the Swede’s night. Realizing her impending incarceration, the suave Swede’s optimism turned to threats against national security … and undergarments. While waiting for her complimentary ride to the county jail, the femme fatale began yelling, “I have a Swedish terrorist in my panties. I have a bomb. I’m a Swedish terrorist and I will kill you.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/","id":3816,"author":{"id":264,"name":"Megan Meyer"},"related":[3815,3814,3813],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Executive Director Marisela Marquez rejected the question on the grounds that it was too specific for Wednesday night’s public Legislative Council meeting, prompting Bishop to clarify that her query described a hypothetical scenario involving any chair of any committee.</p>\n<p>Seemingly satisfied, Marquez explained how and why she utilizes preemptive action to follow through on impulses of keen perception and dispel the dangers of the unknown.</p>\n<p>“If you’re talking about, say, the Internal Vice President, it doesn’t have a vote but there is a great deal of pressure that could be brought on them, potentially,” Marquez said. “At the very least, there’s a perception of a conflict of interest; that’s the issue we’re charged with making sure doesn’t happen. If these are potentially two trains that are going to cross and derail, then why wait until it gets derailed?”</p>\n<p>Under the direction of Marquez, A.S. Associate Director for Special Projects Denise Rinaldi threatened to exercise the permanent staff’s power to terminate student employees in an ultimatum offered to former Judicial Council chair Jeanne Sabin. Given the choice to keep either her job as Legislative Council’s minute-taker — a title she’s held for three years that provides a consistent, hourly income — or her newly-appointed position as the non-voting chair of Judicial Council, Sabin tearfully resigned from the latter on Sept. 28.</p>\n<p>Sabin declined to comment, saying she feared repercussions from the permanent staff.</p>\n<p>Many members of the council, including Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker, spoke out against Marquez’s claim that holding the two positions at once could present a plausible conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>“Because she’s the minute-taker of Legislative Council and she doesn’t hold an elected position … All she does is listen to what’s said and write it down,” Stryker said. “Students from both parties were really outraged.”</p>\n<p>A council member brought the issue of inconsistent policy enforcement to the meeting’s forefront when he attempted to explain how he knows other students who hold similar dual positions within A.S., but was interrupted when Stryker requested that he “try not to be specific, please.”</p>\n<p>According to On-Campus Representative Kristian Whittaker, Marquez spoke to council members at Legislative Council’s retreat last weekend and encouraged them to consider holding closed meetings and speaking cryptically during open meetings to avoid controversy. While Article VI, Section 1 allows Legislative Council to hold closed meetings with the approval of two-thirds of the members, Whittaker said Marquez’s recommendations extended beyond conducting private business behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>“Well, what we would do is we would ask for the person [at the podium] to present an example that would be similar to the situation, but not so much exactly the situation,” Whittaker[[ok]] said.</p>\n<p>In spite of her own recommendations, Marquez allowed the violation of mandated vagueness and asked a favor of the council.</p>\n<p>“Staff would prefer not to do those dual appointments, so if you have those folks that you want to point out to me, that would be helpful,” Marquez said in complete seriousness as many council members and attendees failed to stifle their laughter.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Jonathan Abboud said whether or not the contentious policy is permitted, allegations of a conflict of interest simply do not make sense in Sabin’s case.</p>\n<p>“Jeanne is the most unbiased person in A.S.,” Abboud said. “I don’t think she would be biased at all, and that’s why I was so opposed to her being put in that position. … We were all really confused, like, ‘Did this just happen? Seriously?’”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Article VI, Section 2 of the Legal Code recognizes the A.S. President’s clear authority over the Executive Director, stating that “The President shall: 1) Be the Chief Executive Officer of the Associated Students and shall coordinate and be responsible for the functioning of the A.S. Executive Director.”</p>\n<p>Abboud cited Sabin’s excellent record with Presidents past and current as another compelling and legally verified reason to allow her to serve in both roles.</p>\n<p>“[Jeanne] has seen three different Legislative Councils, three different Presidents and she’s taken the minutes consistently,” Abboud said. “She really wanted to get involved in A.S. as an appointed member and that’s when she went to Judicial Council because that’s what she thought she’d be good at, and two different Presidents thought she would be good at that job — Harrison and Paul.”</p>\n<p>Former A.S. President J.P. Primeau, who served during the 2008-09 school year, said he often clashed with permanent staff members in a continuous struggle for authority.</p>\n<p>“One of my key goals as President was to change the relationship between students and administrators,” Primeau wrote in the A.S. 08-09 Annual Report. “I had always felt that, despite our tremendous ability to organize and advocate, we reacted to university policy after it had been established (Minimum Cumulative Progress being the prime example). To change that policy students would need to take a more proactive approach based on shared governance — simply put, more students needed to be at the table when big decisions were made.”</p>\n<p>Third Supervisorial District Representative for Santa Barbara County Democratic Central Committee and Mixed Student Union Co-Chair Nicole Leopardo, who ran for External Vice President of Local Affairs with the Democratic Process Party last Spring, said the staff’s hard work often goes unappreciated but has also threatened the autonomy of various groups and members within the organization.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I want the permanent staff to step in and make decisions because I feel like they might be the most logical people in some situations, but other times, like with this situation, [students] should be able to make their decisions,” Leopardo said. “Harrison should be able to make his appointments. That’s not saying we can’t be critical of him, but I just don’t know how I feel about permanent staff kind of stomping on his decisions.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Leopardo said she’s shocked by the permanent staff’s lack of legislative authorization for their interference in students’ jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>“There’s no one to check them,” Leopardo said. “There’s no one to say, ‘Hey, you’re not doing your job,’ and that’s what we as students should be doing. There is no democratic process; there are no checks and balances. Right now, it’s a difficult situation.”</p>\n<p>Sabin’s removal leaves the council below quorum with only two remaining members. As such, it cannot function as a judiciary body nor can it move forward with proceedings on currently unresolved cases, such as one from last Spring involving several members of Open People’s Party.</p>\n<p>As a result of unsubstantiated allegations, four elected Legislative Council members were removed from their positions and replaced by the four closest runners-up despite the fact that Judicial Council has yet to reach a ruling. The council is currently seeking applicants and was expected to resolve the case this quarter after accepting the accused party’s petition for a hearing in late May.</p>\n<p>Stryker said any students with concerns can contact the Attorney General or submit a petition or file a case with Judicial Council, which will be reviewed as soon as the entity reaches its quorum of three members.</p>\n<p>In the interim, Abboud said he will be working with the ad hoc committee to put measures in place to protect student employee rights.</p>\n<p>“My personal goal would be to codify exactly what rights A.S. [student] employees have,” Abboud said. “Do they or do they not have the right to be appointed members of A.S.? Personally, I would want them to have that right; probably everyone on Legislative Council does, but I’m not going to speak for them — I can’t — but it seems that she should be able to participate in A.S. and take our minutes.”</p>\n<p>Stryker said while maintaining a working balance between the staff and the students can be taxing, a unified Legislative Council can reinstate its ultimate authority by ballot, if needed.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really tough relationship between the staff end of A.S. and the Legal Code part of A.S. because there’s nothing really in the Legal Code that gives any protection over the students when it comes to what happens if admin disagrees, except for the Executive Director — she can be voted out by three-fourths of Legislative Council.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The first installment of this article can be found at the following location: http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-10-06/director-intrudes-student-rights/</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/","id":3126,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3125,3124,3123],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: The League of Extraordinary Quarterbacks","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"[media-credit name=”Ian Sander” align=”alignleft” width=”250″][/media-credit]Lloyd Christmas: “I’m ready for commitment, Harry!

There has been some killer games and moments, plenty of action and surprises, as well as record-breaking performances.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the league’s quarterbacks — and some of their unstoppable offenses — have emphatically stolen the show through three games this season, carnivorously feasting on opposing defenses.</p>\n<p>In week one alone, Tom Brady and Chad Henne combined for 906 passing yards, an NFL single-game record, and quarterbacks combined for 7,842 yards, more than in any other week in NFL history. Even more astounding, 14 quarterbacks passed for 300 or more yards more than in any week, and there were five games, the most in history, with two 300-yard passers.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, an unbelievable five QBs are on pace to break Dan Marino’s single season passing record of 5,084 yards. Matthew Stafford, who has his popular breakout candidate Detroit Lions at 3-0 for the first time in 31 years, is on pace to throw for 5,210 yards. Philip Rivers is on pace for 5,221. Rookie of the Year Cam Newton (can we just give him the trophy now?) is on pace for 5,397. Drew Brees is on pace for 5,648, and finally, his royalty — coming in at 34 years of age, standing at 6’4”, weighing in 225 lbs., with long, blonde flowing locks, a beautiful wife, and sporting UGG shoes — is Tom Brady, who, after passing for 940 for two games, 1,327 for three yards through three games, is on pace to throw for a godly 7,077 yards on the season.</p>\n<p>Those on the receiving end of this plethora of passing yards are also on their way to breaking records. Wes Welker, after last week’s insane line of 16 grabs for 217 yards and 2 TDs against the Bills, is one pace to grab 165 catches for 2,443 yards on the season — both would be NFL records. Additionally, Pittsburgh’s Mike Wallace and Carolina’s Steve Smith are on pace to beat Jerry Rice’s single season record of 1,848 receiving yards.</p>\n<p>Okay, okay. Calm down. I know, I know. It has only been three weeks. I know. Buuut stillllll. Pretty amazing. While it’s far too early to truly extrapolate and expect record-breaking performances, there is something to take away from this.</p>\n<p>The NFL — where traditionally you need to establish the run and feature a stingy defense to succeed — has become a full-blown quarterback league. It has been headed this way for a little while now, but we are now there. You absolutely NEED a star quarterback to compete. I would rather have Tom Brady than the entire Jets defense, because the old mantra of “defense wins championships” no longer holds true. You NEED an offense capable of scoring 30 points, and that starts with a star QB.</p>\n<p>It could be that new rule changes are protecting quarterbacks and wide receivers more than ever, and that, without pressure, the great quarterbacks of the league are able to pick apart secondaries like never before. Defenses are being effectively hindered by an increasing amount of restrictive rules. Also, offenses — with no-huddle sets and innovative formations starring empty backfields, three wide receiver sets, and pass-catching running backs and tight ends  — have become so evolved, and defenses have yet to catch up. The great quarterbacks are winning the chess battle, allowing their teams to effectively take advantage of the mismatches they create.</p>\n<p>The truly surprising part of this is that it is happening so early in the year. I mean, I thought that because of the lockout, offenses were supposed to struggle to find a rhythm and get in sync, and low scoring defensive affairs were sure to happen. Not so much. I mean, Brady came just 13 yards short of becoming the first QB to pass for 400 yards in three consecutive games. EVER. And he did it in the first three weeks, and after a lockout shortened off-season because it is an adjective training camp.</p>\n<p>Could it be that defenses — in particular secondaries — are the units that are out of sync? There has been an abundance of blown coverages and pass interference penalties. It does make sense that the missed training camp time would hurt defenses more; a secondary unit relies more on the unity and cohesiveness of the group more than an offense. Rather than running routes with set assignments as an offense does, a defense must not only adapt to the offense, but also to each other.</p>\n<p>Either way, the NFL does love these high-scoring affairs, as should you. So sit back, and enjoy them; unless of course you are inexcusably stuck watching a brutal 49ers/Bengals game (AKA the largest pillow fight in NFL football history). Thank God for NFL Sunday ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41204\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/sunday-funday-league-extraordinary-quarterbacks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41204\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/sunday-funday-league-extraordinary-quarterbacks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/sunday-funday-league-extraordinary-quarterbacks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/sunday-funday-league-extraordinary-quarterbacks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/sunday-funday-league-extraordinary-quarterbacks/","id":3496,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[3495,3494,3493],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Ochhocinco: Don’t Kiss Da Baby Just Yet!","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ochocinco_IS.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ochocinco_IS.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Good ne [media-credit name=”Ian Sander” align=”alignleft” width=”250″][/media-credit]ws boys and girls: I’m back.

I know you’ve been confused without me. You’ve been biting your fingernails wondering just what to do with your fantasy team. Well fret no more, for I am here to help, and just in time too. In case you weren’t paying attention, there is a new collective bargaining agreement, and football is back. Yet it is a different league than it was, as the aftermath of the new collective bargaining agreements saw players who had been cornerstones of their teams for years cut and traded.<br>\nOne such player is Chad Ochocinco, the wide receiver formerly known as Chad Johnson, who is now with the New England Patriots after spending the previous 10 years with the Bengals. Now I know some of you saw that and decided to draft him for your fantasy team, believing that he’d come in and immediately take over the role that Randy Moss once played. I understand why you would think that, but it’s completely stupid.<br>\nOcho, while speedy, was never a deep threat on the level of Moss, and the Patriots run arguably the most complex offense in the league. Expecting him to come in and pick it up immediately after a shortened offseason and after spending the previous 10 years working in a much simpler offense is expecting a miracle. There was absolutely no way it was going to happen.<br>\nHowever, I do believe it will be sooner rather than later that Ochocinco will start to step up. Yes, he hasn’t done much through the first three weeks of the season and yes, he did drop an easy pass from Tom Brady that would have gone for a touchdown against the Bills, but he has a lot of things going for him right now. First of all, he no longer has the stupidest, most self-indulgent name in sports. That dubious honor now belongs to Ron Artest, otherwise known as Metta World Peace.<br>\nSecondly, the Patriots’ offense, while complex, requires hard work and promotes constant improvement in those willing to put in the work. Talented players like Ochocinco can thrive in that offense if they work hard — and Ocho does want to work, if only to prove that he’s still one of the best. He is learning the offense, slowly but surely. The mere fact that he was targeted on that long pass against Buffalo is evidence of that, as in the previous two games he had only been targeted on short passes. He will, eventually, be the deep threat for New England.<br>\nFinally, the Patriots have a lot of weapons. While that does mean that Ochocinco will see fewer targets than he would on a team where he was the featured weapon, it also means that defenses can’t focus on him alone. They also have to watch out for Deion Branch, Wes Welker, Aaron Hernandez, Rob Gronkowski and the myriad of other receivers that the Patriots roll out each week, all of whom are capable and dangerous. As an added bonus, the Patriots have a respectable ground game. The Law Firm named BenJarvus Green-Ellis was a 1000 yard rusher a year ago and Danny Woodhead is quick and a good receiver out of the backfield. Additionally, rookie Stevan Ridley looked good against the Bills.<br>\nI don’t mean to overly praise the Patriots. My point is simply that most teams can’t afford to double team Ochocinco because of all the weapons Tom Brady has at his disposal. Once Ocho learns the offense, and he will, he will be able to break that single coverage for long scores. He still has that ability, so don’t be discouraged by his early season struggles. New England will be good for him in the end, and he will produce. If you drafted him thinking he’d immediately be a major contributor…well, you shouldn’t have. But don’t give up on him just yet. If I’m right, and I usually am, those who are patient will be rewarded.<br>\nPick Up of the Week: Matt Hasselbeck, QB, Tennessee Titans. Thus far Hasselbeck seems rejuvenated. He’s thrown for over 300 yards in two of his first three games with the Titans to go along with seven touchdowns. He’s developed a good rapport with receiver Kenny Britt, and with the exception of this week the two have been torching defenses, including the stout Baltimore Ravens. With running back Chris Johnson still struggling to get going, Hasselbeck is going to be asked to shoulder more of the load, and so far that doesn’t seem like a bad thing. If you are in need of a starting quarterback or a capable backup, Hasselbeck is available in 81.5 percent of ESPN leagues.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41210\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41210\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/","id":3500,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[3499,3498,3497],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Legacy of Thomas M.

After graduating at the age of 22, he returned to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Although he had no prior experience in journalism, Storke quickly became involved in the newspaper business. He started out as a cub reporter, feeling his way through the business, but became a newspaper owner within a few short years.</p>\n<p>“In 1900, Tom Storke, aged 24, borrowed $2,000 to buy the Daily Independent, weakest of the town’s three papers,” an October 13, 1971 New York Times article reads. “He sold it in 1909 and went back into the business in 1913 as owner of the Santa Barbara Daily News. Not long afterward he reacquired the Independent and published the combined paper as the Daily News and Independent.”</p>\n<p>In 1932, Storke took yet another paper under his wing.</p>\n<p>“Thomas Storke, editor and publisher of the Santa Barbara  Daily News, faced a dilemma that seems positively alien in 2004,” Matt Welch wrote in a Reason.com article. “Storke’s competition, the 58-year-old Santa Barbara Morning Press, was on the brink of bankruptcy, and it begged him to take over as owner.”</p>\n<p>Thus, the Santa Barbara News-Press was born.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Storke of All Trades</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to journalism, Storke pursued work  in a variety of other fields. In 1938, he stepped up  in the place of Senator William Gibbs McAddoo  and served as a California senator for two months.  He founded the AM radio station KTMS, was a  member of the California Crime Commission from  1951 to 1952 and served as a University of California  regent from 1955 to 1960. He wrote two autobiographies, including California Editor.</p>\n<p>Storke was also instrumental in establishing  the Santa Barbara Airport, the man-made Lake  Cachuma and UC Santa Barbara. Under the college  land grant program, Storke used his political ties to  secure 900 coastal acres of the land UCSB stands on  today.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>California Editor</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 1961, Storke published a series of exposés identifying the John Birch Society — founded in the late  1950s and still active today as right-wing political  advocacy group — as a totalitarian organization.</p>\n<p>“My grandfather was basically a very kind and  gentle man,” Thomas Storke Cox, Storke’s grandson,  said in an e-mail. “However, he did not suffer fools  gladly and  he could only be pushed so far  before  striking back. That is what happened in the case of  the John Birch Society. … Once the Birchers went  after his close friend … he decided to return the favor  and go after them.”</p>\n<p>According to a May 23, 2011 Santa Barbara  Independent article by Michael Redmon, the Society  started out with only 11 members during the Cold  War but, by the early 1960s, had a membership of  nearly 100,000.</p>\n<p>“The primary purpose of the organization in this  period was to expose and root out what members  perceived to be the pervasive and dangerous influences of communism in all aspects of American life,”  the article reads.</p>\n<p>Among those under attack by the Society were  President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Storke’s  good friend and former Supreme Court Chief of  Justice Earl Warren, for whom the Earl Warren  Showgrounds are named.</p>\n<p>In response, the Santa Barbara News-Press  slammed the Society for its divisive attacks on  notable — and, in Storke’s opinion, undeserving —  political leaders.</p>\n<p>“During recent weeks, the News-Press has  sought to enlighten its readers about a semi-secret organization called the John Birch Society,” one of the editorials reads. “The News-Press condemns the destructive campaign of hate and vilification that the John Birch Society is waging against national leaders who deserve our respect and confidence. How can anyone follow a leader absurd enough to call former President Eisenhower ‘a dedicated conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy’?”</p>\n<p>In 1962, Storke was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing in addition to the Lauterbach Award by the Nieman Foundation of Harvard and the Elijah Lovejoy Fellowship for courageous journalism.</p>\n<p>Newspapers were one of Storke’s great life passions and though he sold the NewsPress in 1964, Storke remained editor and publisher emeritus.</p>\n<p>In a speech at the Annual Dinner Meeting of the California Press Association, Storke said, “I still say that the first responsibility of editors and publishers is to their own community. But, when the job is done well, its byproducts can become greater than the first objective.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“These bells ring for freedom…”</strong></p>\n<p>In 1969, Storke spoke at the official dedication for his namesake, Storke Tower, which he helped fund.</p>\n<p>“It is my hope that the publications coming from this building will be the finest examples of journalism developed on any campus in America — perhaps in the world,” Storke said. “Talented students are here. Brilliant faculty members are here. Working together, they can produce publications of national and international scope — for the enlightenment of civilized people everywhere.”</p>\n<p>The Daily Nexus student newspaper, La Cumbre yearbook and KCSB radio station have worked out of the offices under the tower for years.</p>\n<p>The building’s original pamphlet notes that the landmark soars 175 feet above the campus’ main-level and is the tallest structure in the entire county. Within the tower lies a 61-bell carillon, the only five-octave chromatic bell system in existence.</p>\n<p>On October 12 of 1971, just two years after the Storke Tower dedication, Thomas More Storke died after suffering a stroke.  He was 94 years old.</p>\n<p>Storke was survived by 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. The Davidson Library’s Special Collections alone has over 200 condolence letters, cards and telegrams sent to his widow within two weeks after his passing.</p>\n<p>According to Cox, few of today’s journalists exhibit the same fearlessness as his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“The whole concept of an ‘independent journalist’ à la my grandfather has become almost an anachronism in these days of the 24-hour news cycle, Facebook, Twitter, etc.,” he said. “Even the concept of an ‘independent newspaper’ has become almost quaint since the way things are now going there may not be a lot of ‘newspapers’ left in the future, let alone ones whose editorial policies are set by one dedicated individual as was the case of the Santa Barbara NewsPress fifty years ago.”</p>\n<p>Storke’s memory is alive in the bells that chime every hour on the hour.

Elections Committee’s allegations that members of the party furnished alcohol to minors during Spring Elections.</p>\n<p>Four unelected Democratic Process Party candidates were sworn in at last Wednesday’s Legislative Council meeting to replace four elected Open People’s Party representatives, who were given the option to either resign or be disqualified from the 2011-2012 council. Four current council members, OPP off-campus representatives Danielle Foster, Reena Fram and Drey Liautaud and OPP Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter have been given the ultimatum to either resign from office or serve their terms without honoraria.</p>\n<p>Despite reports from other campus publications, the individuals have not been charged with soliciting votes in exchange for alcohol.</p>\n<p>According to OPP member and A.S. President Harrison Weber, A.S. Judicial Council can either approve Elections Committee’s recommendations or take the case to a trial. Unless Judicial Council agrees to take the case, Weber said its specifics must remain confidential.</p>\n<p>“Technically, according to the process, this is not public until Judicial Council decides to hear the case,” Weber said. “Whether or not I agree with the process, I have to defer to the wisdom of students past who constructed these policies.”</p>\n<p>During public forum at yesterday’s legislative council meeting, third-year environmental studies major Marjan Riazi called for the four remaining accused council members to step down and demanded that A.S. Elections Committee minutes be made public. The committee did not respond to the incident harshly enough, Riazi said.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s an issue that any of the people that were charged were sworn in because it perpetuates a system that undermines democracy,” Riazi said. “Executives are in charge of the party and should be held more accountable for the party’s actions.”</p>\n<p>Riazi said executive officers who ran as OPP candidates should be held accountable for the accusations regardless.</p>\n<p>“I know that you know exactly what’s going on in your party and if you’re going to run the school, you better know what’s going on in your party,” Riazi said. “I want those people to be held accountable and if any of those executive officers were involved, they should step down or be disqualified.”</p>\n<p>However, Weber said he had no knowledge of the alleged actions until after the complaint was filed and cannot answer for the actions of an entire party.</p>\n<p>“To my knowledge, executives cannot physically be everywhere at one time,” Weber said. “At the end of the day, people are adults and they make their own decisions.”</p>\n<p>Former DPP Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville said allowing the four accused representatives to remain on the council without receiving honoraria is not an appropriate punishment.</p>\n<p>“Honoraria is what keeps [council members] accountable,” Mayville said. “If you don’t get honoraria, it’s hard to stay accountable because there is less of a sense of motivation. Where does the incentive come from?”</p>\n<p>Vice-Chair of Committee on Committees Kellie Hartl said Elections Committee told her she would have to serve six hours of community service or be forced to resign. However, Hartl said she was not directly involved in OPP campaigning since she holds an appointed, not elected, position.</p>\n<p>“The claims that are being made against me are unfair,” Hartl said. “I’ve never run for office; I’m in an appointed position.”</p>\n<p>Elections Committee charged Hartl with involvement in the incident through her supposed status as a party liaison to OPP. According to the Article 14 of the A.S. Legal Code, party liaisons are individuals involved with the party who may or may not be candidates. The code requires that these individuals sign a promissory note agreeing that they will not violate A.S. Legal Code or local, state or federal law — a form Hartl said she never signed.</p>\n<p>Disqualified OPP Representative-at-Large Kelly Gandee, who garnered the fourth most votes of any 2011-2012 Legislative Council representative, said the Elections Committee has handled the investigation poorly.</p>\n<p>“I would like to have seen a more organized form of questioning,” Gandee said. “I felt attacked during the sentencing meeting and I felt like I was being pressured to resign without factual evidence.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Dariush Banihashemi said during last night’s Legislative council meeting that it is important for A.S. members to act as role models for other students and silence student publications.</p>\n<p>“There are many things that haven’t been brought up and this is a bad road to go down,” Banihashemi said. “A.S. council members, it is your duty to set an example around campus and to not give quotes to the Nexus.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40228\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40228\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/","id":3120,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3119,3118,3117],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Representatives</strong></p>\n<p>Six unelected representatives were sworn in to the 2011-2012 Associated Students Legislative Council at last night’s meeting to replace four newly elected representatives involved in an ongoing judicial council case in addition to two representative-elects who have officially resigned.</p>\n<p>After pleading no contest to charges of grand theft, unauthorized alteration of a computer data system, felony burglary and receiving stolen property at his preliminary hearing yesterday, Representative-at-Large-elect Joe Lee formally stepped down from his position, citing “idiotic political pressure … roaming around A.S.” Lee, who was replaced by Democratic Process Party representative-at-large Sophia Armen, went on to accuse an unnamed fellow council member of extortion during the meeting’s public forum. Lee is scheduled to appear in court for his next hearing on June 22.</p>\n<p>In addition, Open People’s Party On-Campus Representative-elect Pancho Occiano chose to defer his position on next year’s council to D.P.P. On-Campus Representative Christian Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Four elected O.P.P. members — Representatives-at-Large Kelly Gandee and Chelsea Parrott and Off-Campus Representatives Lauren Begleiter and Alexa Cover — were charged with supplying alcohol to minors during Spring Elections by A.S. Elections Committee on May 6 and face either disqualification or forced resignation pending Judicial Council’s approval of the case. The four were replaced by D.P.P. Off-Campus Representatives Xenia Mendez and Marlene Moreno and D.P.P. Representatives-at-Large Danielle Stevens and Danielle Bermudez.</p>\n<p>Four additional council members — O.P.P. Off-Campus Representatives Danielle Foster, Reena Fram and Drey Liautaud and O.P.P. Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter — were charged with the same infraction but given the option to either resign or serve their terms without receiving honoraria. All four were sworn in last night and plan to remain on the council. Former Legislative Council members Yeni Nguyen and Kellie Hartl were also implicated in the case but may not fall under the purview of Elections Committee as they are no longer student government representatives. O.P.P. Executive Board members President Harrison Weber, Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker, External Vice President of Local Affairs Tim Benson and External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Ahmed Mostafa were also charged and given the option to either resign or serve as planned and complete 45 hours of A.S.-related community service each during the 2011-2012 academic year. All four plan to remain in their newly appointed positions.</p>\n<p>Judicial Council is slated to inform the individuals today of its decision to either approve Elections Committee’s recommendations or hear an appeal drafted by the Executive board members on behalf of all 14 implicated students.</p>\n<p>According to Benson, Elections Committee — which holds closed meetings only — reached their decision in a manner not consistent with A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely taking [the case] to Judicial Council because we feel that, based on the Legal Code and based on the rules that are in place for the elections committee, they followed them improperly and we were unjustly given pretty harsh punishments,” Benson said. “They never gave me any due process in any of this. I felt that it wasn’t really fair that I was given no chance to explain myself, no chance to explain any of my involvement in what was going on and I was given quite a hefty slap on the wrist.”</p>\n<p>Visit dailynexus.com for online updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Regular Business</strong></p>\n<p>In their final meeting, the 2010-2011 council approved a reallocation of $700 for a planned UC Haiti Initiative and set aside $55,000 — comprised of funding from the budgets of various BCCs — to fund the A.S. Annex, an Isla Vista community center that provide offices for A.S. entities, in the next fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Former Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis said while he supported the allocation, he is concerned the center’s location is not accessible to students in the community.</p>\n<p>“I think this is a great bill but I drove by and checked out the building, and it seems a bit hidden,” Lewis said. “I’d eventually like to have a sign or notice on that street to attract some attention since I don’t think it’ll get a lot of foot traffic on its own.”</p>\n<p>Former Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said the resolution provides that there will be such signs in the surrounding area of the center.</p>\n<p>The council reallocated $200 instead of an originally requested $467 for Black Graduation to print graduation programs. Lewis said the funding did not seem necessary as it would benefit only a select number of students.</p>\n<p>“I just don’t feel it represents the entire student body as student funds should,” Lewis said. “I feel it’s exclusive to the rest of the student body.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville authored a Green Bill mandating sustainable practices within A.S. buildings, including recycling, composting, avoiding paper and using green cleaning products. The bill was amended to include a mandate that A.S. funds given for group events or meetings may only purchase food that is at least 50 percent sustainable.</p>\n<p>While Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez said the request would be unrealistic for student groups and drive up event costs, Mayville said the bill is intended to set a precedent for the rest of the student body.</p>\n<p>“I do recognize it is expensive, but I think a little less food or more costly food is worth it because it is socially and environmentally responsible, and A.S. needs to set an example,” Mayville said.</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker said the bill’s specificity would make it difficult to enforce.</p>\n<p>“Coming from a Finance board perspective, another really tough thing will be how to let groups know about all this,” Stryker said. “It’s going to be hard for groups to follow all of this. Make it more broad so student groups can feasibly follow and understand it.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the council has the duty to implement progressive policies and student groups have been asked to follow similar rules in the past.</p>\n<p>“[Office of Student Life] groups learn so quickly about what our funding policies are,” Tzankov said. “I think it’s important that we do set the precedent and we don’t put this off, but approve it as it is.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually passed the bill with an amendment making it applicable to only A.S. entities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council deliberated over a bill to increase transparency within the group by posting audio recordings of its weekly meetings on the association’s website. However, the bill failed to pass due to expensive software and microphone costs. Tsankov said he recommended that the newly appointed council continue discussion on the measure.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39346\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39346\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/","id":3123,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3122,3121,3120],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

For the first time, A.S. Program Board required attendees to present an ACCESS card to gain entrance, making the event exclusive to the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>The change was met with mixed feelings from students but many agreed that wait times were significantly reduced.</p>\n<p>Yasmin Sharawy, a second-year biology major, said she saw a marked difference in lines between this and last year’s events.</p>\n<p>“Last year it took us two hours to get in,” Sharawy said. “This year it took us two minutes.”</p>\n<p>Second-year linguistics major Dana Fallon said while she was disappointed that visitors were not welcome, the change positively influenced crowd management at the historically hectic happening.</p>\n<p>“My friend from out of town came last year,” Fallon said. “It’s too bad she couldn’t come this year, but it was overall a lot faster and it’s more fun with only UCSB students.”</p>\n<p>Local band Sprout, winner of this year’s Battle of the Bands, kicked off the event after gates opened at 1 p.m. Michael Wagman, an undeclared second-year, said the act set a good tone for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>“Sprout was great,” Wagman said. “We got here 15 minutes after it opened and saw the openers. The djembe player was amazing and fine.”</p>\n<p>The next act, Santa Cruz-based ska group The Expendables, received similar praise for their diverse tunes, which incorporated styles spanning from punk rock to reggae. Sharawy said the set proved enjoyable to everyone from diehard fans to first-time listeners.</p>\n<p>“I hadn’t heard of them until now,” Sharawy said. “But they’re really good live.”</p>\n<p>Rapper Talib Kweli took the stage next, performing a diverse selection of tunes with music by other artists such as The Beatles mixed into his own songs. During his set, Kweli reprimanded Fox News for calling rapper Common “vile” and denounced the channel by calling it an entertainment source lacking in real news value.</p>\n<p>English DJ Rusko followed with an hour of dubstep that set off a massive wave of dancing within the crowd but was nonetheless met with mixed reactions. Uce Nnadi, a second-year political science major, said the DJ gave a quality performance.</p>\n<p>“He came and delivered,” Nnadi said. “It was dubstep in its purest.”</p>\n<p>However, third-year mathematics major Eric Frydendal was not as impressed with the artist’s spins.</p>\n<p>“I’m too sober for this shit,” Frydendal said.</p>\n<p>Headliner Cee Lo Green then took the stage, opening with a rendition of Black Sabbath’s “Crazy Train.” The Gnarls Barkley singer covered various other rock songs before unveiling his former band’s top single “Crazy” and his own recent chart-topper “Fuck You.” Green closed the set with a rendition of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing” to end the festival.</p>\n<p>Sharawy said the artist’s performance was an improvement in entertainment from previous years.</p>\n<p>“He started off slow, but it got really good at the end because we knew the songs,” Sharawy said. “It was way better this year. He was a way better headliner than Drake. He tried to please the crowd while Drake didn’t.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38843\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38843\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/","id":3137,"author":{"id":214,"name":"Mackensie Minniear"},"related":[3136,3135,3134],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Current Council Convenes for Last Spring Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council instated an expansion of the A.S.

Emergency Loan program during last night’s final meeting before government turnovers.</p>\n<p>The council officially placed the newly created UCSB Community Financial Fund — a student loan program approved as a new fee during this year’s Spring Elections — into the association’s by-laws. Additionally, the council approved a request of $459 to fund a week-long advertisement in the Santa Barbara Independent publicizing the May 26 event “The Alternative: Bringing Power to Our Voices,” which will take place during College Republicans’  David Horowitz lecture.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the event aims to appease students concerned about the controversial message behind Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>“He has decades of experience of twisting your words and forcing you to say something,” Tzankov said. “It’s just not a healthy space for dialogue. We didn’t want to work in his space but created an alternative event where we will have a healthy space for dialogue.”</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joe Lee, however, said scheduling the speeches at separate times would allow students to attend both lectures and provide more balanced arguments.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be effective if you see the event first and have a reactive event to that,” Lee said. “We don’t know what’s going to be happening there. Maybe if you have it before or after, students who are attending David Horowitz will have an opportunity to attend this event.”</p>\n<p>Despite Lee’s suggestion the forum was not rescheduled and is slated to take place during Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>The council also discussed a Bill to Restructure Queer Commission that proposed additional unfunded positions on the committee to further gender education efforts on campus.</p>\n<p>University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid said the legislation would provide vital resources to ensure equality on campus.</p>\n<p>“We created the first Queer Alumni Network, which is a branch of the Alumni Association, specifically for queer alumni,” Del Cid said. “We’re just making sure that’s established and institutionalized within the positions so it can sustain itself. This also creates a position for transfer students as a way for someone who’s new to the community to get involved.”</p>\n<p>However, a significant amount of debate arose over the intricacies of the bill’s language including references to the gender identity “genderfuck.”</p>\n<p>As of press time, the council tabled the bill until after discussions on old business, leaving the genderfuck issue unresolved.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38464\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38464\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/","id":3136,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3135,3134,3133],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Council Meets Controversy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council spent the majority of last night’s meeting discussing funding for College Republicans’ proposal to bring controversial speaker David Horowitz to campus.

Finance Board meeting, College Republicans requested that Legislative Council reopen the board’s minutes and allocate $1,770 for the event’s audio-visual, recording and security costs. Horowitz, a noted conservative activist and writer, last visited campus in April 2008 shortly after accusing UCSB’s Muslim Student Association of having political ties with al-Qaeda. Although several members of the Muslim Student Association and general campus community attended the meeting in protest of the group’s request, the council eventually approved $800 to the organization.</p>\n<p>As of press time, the council remained in session pending the approval of the A.S. 2011-2012 budget, which faces significant cuts.</p>\n<p>President of College Republicans Steven Begakis requested $1,770 for security, audiovisual technology and visual recording for the proposed event. Begakis said the council should allocate funds on the basis of freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>“We just want to bring a conservative speaker to represent our minority opinion and promote a diversity of ideas,” Begakis said.</p>\n<p>Sophia Armen, a second-year political science and feminist studies major, said the board’s eventual decision to even partially fund the event reflected poorly on the student government.</p>\n<p>“Our association does not look good right now in the eyes of the average student,” Armen said. “I just want you to understand … what isolating communities really means. You’d better have communities on this campus’ back, because it’s your job. Not just because it’s your job — because it’s your moral responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Andres Rey, a second-year political science major, said denying funding for the event would be a violation of a citizen’s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>“That’s freedom of speech: the ability for you to speak,” Rey said. “I think it’s a very important step that the council approves the security for funding because you are denying the vehicle for someone to speak.”</p>\n<p>While On-Campus Representative Danielle Stevens objected that Horowitz’s views transcended the divide between free speech and hate speech, Rey said the speaker’s words are not inflammatory enough to be censored by the association.</p>\n<p>“The definition of hate speech … it has to be directly linked to a violent act,” Rey said. “You have to prove it incites direct acts of hatred and I think that’s something you can’t prove.”</p>\n<p>However, College Republicans Vice President Matt Borasi said the campus has the duty of providing students a space where all voices can be heard.</p>\n<p>“Do I agree with everything that Daniel Horowitz said? No,” Borasi said. “What I do agree with is the open forum the university stands for.”</p>\n<p>Muslim Student Association member Ahmed Naguib, however, said the Muslim community is underrepresented on campus and is unwilling to tolerate further discrimination.</p>\n<p>“There’s 200 or 300 of us on campus. We really fly under the radar,” Naguib said. “But, believe it or not, this is something that really affects us.”</p>\n<p>Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht said the board declined to allocate any funds to College Republicans on Monday as, according to A.S. Legal Code, the association cannot deny funding to events on the basis of offensive content.</p>\n<p>“You need to base this not on the context of the event but on the event itself,” Lieberknecht said. “You really need to look at the policies and procedures of what can and can’t be funded.”</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President Jake Elwood, California state law requires that the UC Regents not deny funding to events based on their content.</p>\n<p>“If we pass the finance board minutes,” Elwood said, “we will be sued by David Horowitz.”</p>\n<p>On April 14, 2008, the Daily Nexus printed an advertisement paid for by the Horowitz Freedom Center, advocating against the Muslim Students Association and accusing it of being a “Campus Front Group For Jihad.”</p>\n<p>“The MSA is a radical political group that was founded by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the godfather of al Qaeda and Hamas, to bring the jihad into the heart of American higher education,” the ad read.</p>\n<p>Nick Dürnhöfer, editor in chief of the Nexus in 2008, said the editorial section of the newspaper cannot execute agency over the advertising section.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t see that ad before it ran in the Nexus — I don’t see any ad that goes in there,” Dürnhöfer said. “I’m not going to let a newspaper get biased in that way by picking and choosing advertisers … When you start thinking that way, you can’t really do you job as an editor.”</p>\n<p>Following a lengthy debate, the board swiftly approved a motion to allocate $1,100 for the event. However, according to Stryker, confusion arose among the representatives as to what the motion they passed entailed as it followed a string of stipulations and modifications.</p>\n<p>“When the amendment is friendly with the person that made the original motion, then that amendment becomes the new motion,” Stryker said. “So when we passed it, we passed that motion. I guess a few got confused and thought we just passed that motion. People that wanted to vote didn’t understand what was going on and thought it was just to pass that amendment.”</p>\n<p>The result was met with outrage from the audience, as individuals shouted “You are sponsoring Islamophobia and racism on this campus,” and “Who on this board is representing the Muslim community?”</p>\n<p>Considering the murky circumstances under which the resolution had been passed, the council moved to amend the allotted amount to $732, providing funding for only police officers.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joseph Lee said the council was overstepping in bounds by reopening the discussion.</p>\n<p>“What happened to the whole point of transparency of this council?” Lee said. “We’re already not doing our jobs and paying attention to what’s going on and just because we admitted to making a mistake that doesn’t mean we get to reconsider something we all passed through consent.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually modified the amount to $800.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lee presented an apology for his recent incarceration. He spent five days in Santa Barbara County jail in relation to a stolen laptop and, after pleading not guilty at his arraignment on Tuesday, is set to appear in court on May 18.</p>\n<p>“My mistakes have brought disappointment and frustration to both my student constituents and my peers,” Lee said. “I am ashamed and I fully regret this situation.”</p>\n<p>Lee said he felt the incident was isolated within his personal life and would not affect his ability to perform his job.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to do my best to continue to perform to the best of my best in leg council to the students that represented me,” Lee said. “This matter solely matters to me.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37861\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37861\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/","id":3134,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3133,3132,3131],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Accused A.S.

Lee, a second-year political science major, was detained in connection with a theft that occurred on April 19 at Santa Catalina residence hall and faces charges of felony burglary, unauthorized altering of computer data system, receiving stolen property and grand theft.</p>\n<p>The decision to plea not guilty was largely a strategic measure, Lee said.</p>\n<p>“It was recommended by my attorney,” Lee said. “It was basically to postpone the preliminary hearing.”</p>\n<p>Despite the controversy, Lee said he will continue to serve as a student body representative — starting at today’s 5 p.m. A.S.

A.S. hopes the meeting encouraged communication between the students and A.S. </p></div>Associated Students held a transitional forum yesterday in the MultiCultural Center to encourage student feedback about the association’s plans for the upcoming year.\n<p>A panel of both incoming and outgoing executive officers led a roundtable discussion among roughly 50 student participants on issues such as the student government’s spending priorities and ongoing projects. The forum aimed to promote transparency within A.S. through an open discussion of topics ranging from increased recycling efforts to student involvement in budgetary issues.</p>\n<p>A.S. President-elect Harrison Weber, a third-year history of public policy major, said the event sought to promote better communication among the association’s various entities and with the student body.</p>\n<p>“A.S. should work on how they can work together,” Weber said. “The forum was a place to listen and talk about what the priorities for next year should be.”</p>\n<p>The forum also served as a medium for students to discuss solutions to next year’s significantly impacted budget. According to current Internal Vice President Jake Elwood, a fourth-year political science major, the association will receive the same amount of funding for 2011-12 as they did for this Spring Quarter alone.</p>\n<p>“We have this mind of expansion but really we’re shrinking,” Elwood said. “We need to change our focus of where we spend our money.”</p>\n<p>Elwood said next year’s executives will need to concentrate on refocusing the management of student fees.</p>\n<p>“A.S. can still grow; we just have to change our mindset,” Elwood said. “Food and T-shirts at every meeting is a luxury. We can do more, but in different ways.”</p>\n<p>Current A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, a fourth-year sociology and global studies major, said student leaders are responsible for incorporating students’ interests into the association’s goals.</p>\n<p>“As elected officials, it is their job to help the grassroots movements,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “Associated Students needs to be associated to the students. If not, then you’re irrelevant.”</p>\n<p>Persian Student Group Co-President Armand Armin, a second-year economics and global studies major, said next year’s officials should develop focused outreach efforts to reach the greater campus community.</p>\n<p>“There are different communities of students that are working really hard on all the issues A.S. is working on,” Armin said. “I think A.S. is ignoring these grassroots movements. You have to look at communities that are actually doing work. It’s not just the students, it’s the families — families that have been here for decades and are being ignored by students.”</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joseph Lee, a second-year political science major, said it is vital to provide information about student governmental matters to students who are living off campus.</p>\n<p>“We need to put A.S. in new students’ heads, but we also want to get the off-campus population involved as well,” Lee said. “We should also think about transferring the good momentum that was built this year to next year.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/","id":3140,"author":{"id":213,"name":"Daniela Montes"},"related":[3139,3138,3137],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Legislative Council Discusses Next Year’s Budget","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council spent the majority of last night’s meeting discussing the specifics of their impacted 2011-2012 budget.

Representatives deliberated over the most effective areas to make cuts, focusing on honoraria and ongoing projects.</p>\n<p>Most of the debate centered on whether finances for the proposed A.S. Isla Vista Annex would come from unallocated funds or the budgets of various A.S. subcommittees that have already donated about $40,000 collectively. Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said requiring further funding from committees would limit their ability to function.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I don’t like taking most of it from committees,” Mayorga said. “They’ve already invested so much in the space and cutting their budget is going to hurt the work they will be doing in the space. The money should come out of unallocated [funds].”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Cori Lantz said funding from committees is a necessary means of determining whether or not the project is viable.</p>\n<p>“This is really a trial run — a chance for us to see if this is something beneficial so if it doesn’t work we can pull out,” Lantz said. “The committees want this to happen and will do everything in their power to see it happen.”</p>\n<p>However, Lantz said students should ultimately determine the project’s fate via a lock-in fee on next year’s Spring Election ballot.</p>\n<p>To absorb requisite cutbacks, Representative-at-Large Chloe Stryker said committee member’s honoraria should constitute a smaller portion of the association’s budget.</p>\n<p>“If you look at our budget, most of our fees are going towards honoraria,” Stryker said. “I don’t think that’s right. Members should be working out of good heart and because they want to be involved.”</p>\n<p>According to Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht, honoraria currently comprises an excessive portion of A.S. finances.</p>\n<p>“Honoraria is the most expensive thing we pay for,” Lieberknecht said. “People give to this association to get something back and not just pay for our salaries.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council deliberated Finance Board’s request for $23,075 from next year’s unallocated budget, $19,000 of which would go toward the group’s honoraria. Lieberknecht said she feels such a substantial request is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>“You should cut our honoraria,” Lieberknecht said. “Most of the money requested would be going towards honoraria.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually decided to approve $21,600 for the board.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/","id":3130,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3129,3128,3127],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Office of the President, is intended to inform students about the expected campus-level consequences of California Governor Jerry Brown’s proposed $500 million cut to the UC. A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, Presidential Leadership Fellow Hadar Dor and Commissioner for Budget Resources Armando Guerrero will serve as the event’s coordinators.</p>\n<p>Monge-Rodriguez said the forum aims to clear up confusion about the University’s finances and allow opportunities for student participation.</p>\n<p>“Many students see and feel the effects of budget cuts but often don’t understand the source of these cuts or who the key decision-makers are in administering them,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “Beyond providing information, we hope to create a space for dialogue where students have the opportunity to counsel UCSB administrators on how to make budgetary decisions in a way that is sensitive to our wants and needs.”</p>\n<p>Campus administrators and faculty members including Executive Vice Chancellor Gene Lucas, Assistant Chancellor Todd Lee, Dean of Undergraduate Education Mary Nisbet and economics professor Henning Bohn will also be present.</p>\n<p>According to Guerrero, the forum will facilitate discussion between campus decision-makers and the student body.</p>\n<p>“A goal that we have is to make the administrators more accessible to the students,” Guerrero said. “We want to try to get the information that circulates among administrators to students.”</p>\n<p>The event will consist of five-minute presentations on budget updates by administrators followed by a Q&amp;A session. According to Dor, the A.S. Office of the President plans to use student input from the forum to develop future budget policies.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to decide ourselves what is important for the student body,” Dor said. “Our role is to find out what the student body wants and then advocate for them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37326\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37326\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/","id":3132,"author":{"id":212,"name":"Dominic LoBuglio"},"related":[3131,3130,3129],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":149,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
