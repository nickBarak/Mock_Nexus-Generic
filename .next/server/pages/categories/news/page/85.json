The nonprofit focuses on providing parent education, low-cost childcare and preparing children to start school.</p>\n<p>Narrowly clearing its Dec. 31 fundraising deadline, IVYP completed its “$300K for $300K Match Campaign,” through a crowdfunding page, which indicated $300,033 raised on the morning of Jan. 1.</p>\n<p>Speaking about the success of the fundraiser, IVYP executive director LuAnn Miller said the “community-based campaign” had donations ranging from a penny to thousands of dollars from local foundations.</p>\n<p>The funds qualify the organization for the County of Santa Barbara’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), which has awarded IVYP an additional $300,000. IVYP intends to use the $600,000 to purchase the building it currently rents near the Camino Real Marketplace, closing out a mortgage of $1.2 million.</p>\n<p>“The CDBG grant from the County of Santa Barbara comprises the final payment of the mortgage, and it really was an ‘all or nothing’ … We needed to get the mortgage gap down to $300,000,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>The County of Santa Barbara reviews and selects grant recipients with a committee of 13 members organized by the Santa Barbara City Council. The committee, referred to as the Community Development and Human Services Committee (CDHSC), consists of representatives from several local groups.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74750\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74750\" data-attachment-id=\"74750\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/childrens-center-benefits-from-new-funds/ivyp-by-jose-ochoa-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ivyp-by-jose-ochoa-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74750\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"LuAnn Miller, Executive Director of IVYP, personally raised $12,230 for IVYP's capital campaign last year.

Waterproof awnings have also been installed in order to protect some of the children’s equipment.</p>\n<p>According to Miller, future renovation plans include extending the tricycle path in the outdoor area, replacing a washing machine and kitchen stove and providing more natural spaces for the children to play in. In order to create more natural areas while remaining environmentally conscious, IVYP hopes to plant a succulent garden.</p>\n<p>In line with its commitment to sustainability, the center ultimately intends to install solar panels in order to curtail their energy costs.

students filled the UC Santa Barbara campus on Election Day 2016 in protest of president-elect Donald Trump. As the echoes of protests die down throughout the country, students are once again bristling in anticipation of a new presidency that may cause irreparable change throughout the country.</p>\n<p>Undocumented students have fallen into the center of this struggle, pinpointed by Trump’s unfavorable rhetoric regarding undocumented immigrants and President Obama’s 2012 initiative, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).</p>\n<p>The California government, the University of California and university law enforcement now attempt to provide answers in the eight days until inauguration.</p>\n<p>In late 2016, UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang signed a statement endorsed by the Association of American Universities in support of DACA. Chancellors from all 10 UC campuses, including UC President Janet Napolitano, also signed the statement.</p>\n<p>Napolitano, a trained lawyer, was the former United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2013. She was criticized at the beginning of her term for implementing the controversial Secure Communities program, an immigration-enforcement policy that detected undocumented immigrants via fingerprints taken by local police.</p>\n<p>In the last three years, however, she has supported the UC’s D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program for undocumented students, allocated $2.5 million per year for created undocumented student fellowships and granted UC’s Undocumented Legal Services Center $900,000 per year under the Undocumented Student Services Program.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of questions with the incoming Trump administration, what it means for universities and what it means for students,” Napolitano said on Jan. 6, speaking to a group of UC journalists. “We don’t have answers to those questions, nobody knows the answers.”</p>\n<p>To combat the unknown, the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) released a set of principles in December listing the boundaries of university police and medical services. “We are very clear that we are not turning university police into surrogate immigration agents, and we’re not gonna be voluntarily turning over student records,” she said.</p>\n<p>When asked about retaliation from the federal government if the UC does not comply with the new presidency, Napolitano said the UC was not in immediate threat.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of talk, particularly in the Republican party right now, about cutting funding in a lot of areas,” she said. “They haven’t singled out campuses, nor have they singled out campuses that have stated their values as we have.”</p>\n<p>Others, though a small minority, support Trump’s ideas and believe undocumented students do not have a place on UC campuses.</p>\n<p>A student who wished to stay anonymous, fearing retaliation, has begun organizing efforts to report undocumented students who attend UC Santa Barbara. He said the group is in a “planning and monitoring phase only” prior to Trump’s inauguration, hoping for a “likely scenario” that the future president will repeal DACA.</p>\n<p>“If Trump lets us down, then it is possible that this will lead nowhere,” he said. “We have a large and growing number of students on board and we have notified the university of our plans, but for the time being, we are all waiting until January 20th.”</p>\n<p>The group is not affiliated with any campus organization, according to the student, and its goal is ensure that UCSB abides by United States immigration laws.</p>\n<p>“I cannot reveal our tactics yet,” the student said. “All I can say for now, is that we consider ourselves to be an honest and patriotic team of whistleblowers when it comes to the potentially illegal activity happening at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Students who have been vocal about reporting undocumented immigrants on the UCSB campus have received threats on social media, and the student who spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> said he had heard violent, threatening rumors and been called a “fascist and a Nazi.”</p>\n<p>In response to a question regarding students who hope to join similar groups at other UC’s, Napolitano said Jan. 6 that it would be more prudent to focus on reporting criminal activity, rather than young people who travel to the U.S. to gain an education.</p>\n<p>Students are currently in the final planning stages of a large walkout to take place on inauguration day Jan. 20, with the Student Activist Network hosting several meetings to create posters and make maps of a march route.</p>\n<p>Administrators and faculty from UCSB have created an ad-hoc committee to discuss undocumented students’ safety while on campus. Among several ideas, campus administrators hope to distribute “know your rights” pamphlets, create faculty sanctuary homes for students and reinforce mental health services for students who feel threatened.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 15, Santa Barbara Police Chief Lori Luhnow said that the SBPD was committed to protecting individual rights, reassuring concerned residents.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to arrest and seek prosecution of anyone who has committed a crime in Santa Barbara, but the immigration status alone of individuals in Santa Barbara is NOT a matter for police action,” she said in a statement.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74791\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74791\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/","id":2446,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2445,2444,2443],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brown: More Funding, Less Aid in the UCs","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tuition-Hike-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tuition-Hike-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gov.

The state would provide a total of $8.4 billion to the UC system in the 2017-18 fiscal year, if the state legislature accepts Brown’s proposal.</p>\n<p>The funding increase reflects a negotiation reached between Brown and Napolitano in May 2015. In the midst of violent student protests, the two agreed to freeze tuition on the contention that the state provide a four percent increase in funding for the next four years. Brown and Napolitano also agreed in May 2015 that the UC would propose a tuition hike no greater than the rate of inflation for the 2017-18 academic year.</p>\n<p>Keeping her end of the bargain, Napolitano proposed last week to raise tuition by 2.5 percent for the 2017-18 academic year, which could be the first tuition hike since 2011. In-state tuition has remained at $11,220 since the 2011-12 academic year, and this proposed hike will increase tuition by $282.</p>\n<p>Anticipating the agreed-upon 2017-18 tuition hike, the UC Regents planned to lay the groundwork for a tuition hike proposal during their November meeting at San Francisco, but the discussion was tabled in the face of student protests.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano held a conference call last Friday with student journalists, during which she addressed the proposed tuition hikes, amongst other matters.</p>\n<p>“In any event, I’m with students that tuition needs to be as low as possible,” Napolitano said in the call. “It also needs to be predictable, and we need to have generous financial aid to help those students from lower-income households. That is what we are striving mightily to do.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74741\" style=\"width: 1017px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74741\" data-attachment-id=\"74741\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/uc-regents-meeting-at-ucsf-mission-bay-by-kenneth-song_for-11-20-2014-8183-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?fit=1007%2C734&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1007,734\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"uc-regents-meeting-at-ucsf-mission-bay-by-kenneth-song_for-11-20-2014-8183\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?fit=250%2C182&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?fit=888%2C647&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74741\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?resize=888%2C647\" alt=\"UCPD officers escort 21-year old UC Berkeley student Jeff Noven through the shattered glass entrance of the UCSF Mission Bay lobby.

An increase in tuition also means an increase in Cal Grants, she said, so low-income students will be able to receive more financial aid.</p>\n<p>Also during the conference call, UC Office of the President (UCOP) spokesperson Dianne Klein said financial aid covers more than just tuition; it covers other “educational expenses” such as housing, transportation and food. She echoed Napolitano in saying the proposed tuition hikes could “provide more resources” to low-income students.</p>\n<p>“It may sound counterintuitive, but the lowest-income students are really going to end up better off because they will receive more financial aid,” Klein said.</p>\n<p>Despite this potential increase in financial aid, Brown’s budget proposal also included a phase-out of the UC Middle Class Scholarship (MCS) program, which provides financial aid to students with family incomes of under $156,000. Students currently receiving such aid would get to keep it in the next academic year, but Brown proposes the UC no longer award the scholarship.</p>\n<p>In a press release Tuesday, Speaker of the Assembly Anthony Rendon dissented to both the proposed tuition hike and the proposal to eliminate the MCS program, which could increase the cost of attending a UC by up to $20,000, he said. Rendon did, however, support increase in UC funds, calling it “good” that higher education receive a “modest funding increase.”</p>\n<p>“We must work to keep college affordable for California students, and I will not support burdening them with higher fees and greater student debt — whether that’s done by raising tuition or phasing out the Middle Class Scholarship,” he said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Regents will discuss tuition hikes at their next meeting on Jan. 25 in San Francisco. Brown will submit a revised budget proposal for the state legislature to vote on in May.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of th</em>e Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/","id":3600,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3599,3598,3597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: I.V.

Clinic building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as they relate to the community. I.V. Community Network meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p>COMMUNITY CENTER<br>\nA meeting to discuss the future of the Isla Vista Community Center will be held 5 p.m. Thursday at the I.V. Clinic building. The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar and Third District County<br>\nSupervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p>PARK IT HERE<br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting 6-8 p.m. Thursday in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Co-op. The board is proposing a special election to take place in May in hopes of instituting a special tax. The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p>MEMORIAL GARDEN<br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting 2 p.m. Friday for upkeep at the Isla Vista Love &amp; Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was created to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014, shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p>THE WEEKEND STRETCH<br>\nLocal group Yoga Isla Vista is having an information session about becoming a yoga teacher this Sunday from 2-4 p.m. at their meeting space in 900 Embarcadero Del Mar, Suite D. They will discussing their upcoming training sessions for teaching yoga.</p>\n<p>VEGAN<br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p>MUSIC ON A MONDAY<br>\nA lineup of Isla Vista-based music groups will be performing 7-11 p.m. Monday at Biko Garage (6612 Sueno Rd). Bands playing are Feral Vida, Horse Movies, Adult School, Bearcats and On Drugs. The venue is provided by Biko Co-op House and is an all-ages, alcohol and substance-free space. As such, organizers ask that attendees “respect the space, house<br>\nmembers and what the Biko Co-op House stands for.”</p>\n<p>FREE FOOD<br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students. This food giveaway is regularly held every Wednesday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

Senate is aiming to create a more organized process for filling vacancies.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students (A.S.) Senate discussed the resignations and appointments of four members at Wednesday’s meeting and how the vacancies will call for the creation of a permanent system of reappointments.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Senate experienced numerous vacancies, but still does not have a clear system devised to replace the senators’ positions. The past unorganized process resulted in conflict as the inconsistency prolonged the senator appointments. Bryan Velasquez’s resignation reminds the association of the importance of a clear procedure when appointing new senators.</p>\n<p>Velasquez, a second-year music major, resigned from his position as an on-campus senator during the 10th week of Fall Quarter, and Senate now must fulfill the position. According to Velasquez, his resignation was prompted by “personal reasons,” and he enjoyed working with Senate.</p>\n<p>“A lot of things happened towards the end of the quarter, and I thought it was best to take some time to figure things out,” Velasquez said.</p>\n<p>He said he would consider running for Senate again in the future, but “[doesn’t] see that happening any time soon.”</p>\n<p>“I would definitely be interested [in joining Senate again],” he said. “They’re all amazing people, and we all work really well together.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year economics major Ashley Selki will organize an ad-hoc committee where current senators will create a process to appoint a new senator to fill Velasquez’s vacancy. The position will then be opened for students to run, and the Senate has five weeks to appoint a new senator.</p>\n<p>EVPLA and fourth-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar encouraged the senators to take their time devising a permanent system as he recalled the vacancies the Senate experienced during his own term last year.</p>\n<p>“I very much encourage you to take your time … make a system, make it good, make it work,” Minoiefar said. “It can affect the whole association.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar warned the Senate against arguing with each other and beginning the appointment process before a proper system is created. He said this would lead to more problems during this appointment and in future cases.</p>\n<p>“Whether you think you’re right, you all need to talk about it in here,” he said. “If you’re not happy with the process before you start, it is going to get a lot worse.”</p>\n<p>The Senate also opened the first meeting of the quarter with the swearing in of second-year political science and communication double major Izabella Kipnis as a new off-campus senator. Kipnis had previously worked with the Senate in the Honoraria Committee, a position that will now be filled by third-year political science major Jordan Goulet.</p>\n<p>Kipnis is currently working on transitioning into the Senate and is beginning to focus on working with I.V. Tenants Union in regards to the rising amount of evictions in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Letters and Science Senator Jasmine Sandhu, third-year biopsychology and sociology double major, was also appointed as the new vice chair of the Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The purpose of this new online tool is to reduce the amount of low priority calls. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Citizen Online Reporting system, as the Sheriff’s Office has named the software, is accessible through their website, sbsheriff.org, under the title “File an Online Report” on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Kelly Hoover, the public information officer for the County Sheriff’s Office, said the idea for the service was well-researched and that several deputies have worked to bring it into fruition.</p>\n<p>“We have deputies who research and selected the Cop Logic program and went through the process of researching what it would take to bring it to Santa Barbara County … and went through all the logistics to make it happen,” she said.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this new online tool is to reduce the amount of low-priority phone calls.</p>\n<p>In a press release Monday morning, Hoover said the “around-the-clock accessibility” will enable residents to “file a report at a time that is convenient to them without waiting for a deputy to respond or call them back.” Reportable incidents include identity theft, vandalism and stolen property, as well as civil complaints such as animal complaints, harassment via telephone and child custody violations.</p>\n<p>Hoover said this will give the deputies who normally file these incidents time to investigate other pressing instances of crime, as the software is meant to streamline the activities of police, “especially during a time when resources are limited.”</p>\n<p>The Sheriff’s Office plans to focus more of its time on investigating trends in crime rather than filing reports which individuals themselves are able to submit.<br>\n“It just cuts back on the amount of time the deputy is working on paperwork that could be filled out by the citizen,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>She said the site is intuitive, but one problem that users might encounter is failing to understand the law enforcement’s jurisdiction when reporting a crime. Police cannot see to a crime that is outside of its legal capacity, as its system distinguishes on its web page. The Sheriff’s Office will not be investigating crimes outside of the county and encourages citizens to submit reports to their corresponding sheriff’s offices. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol office is located on 6504 Trigo Rd.</p>\n<p>For those unsure of how to file a report, the Sheriff’s Office has also created a video tutorial illustrating the process, which they have linked in the preface to their report submission software.</p>\n<p>As for the price of installing the online service, Hoover said the system cost $22,500 to install and that it will cost an additional $15,000 per year to keep running.</p>\n<p>Despite the online platform, officials say urgent offenses and situations must be reported directly with a 911 call.</p>\n<p>“The system is not designed to take the place of the deputy; if residents need to talk to a deputy, by all means we still want them to call,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the

id=\"caption-attachment-74753\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Laura Uzes/Daily Bruin</p></div>\n<p>Protesters stood in front of the campus’ entry gate, holding signs with slogans such as “Our work makes the UC work” and “Pay workers enough to live in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p>Union members across the state surrounded medical centers at UCLA, UCSD and UCSF. UCLA skilled trade union members were on strike for five days in protest of their low wages, marching into Westwood on Tuesday and temporarily blocking traffic.</p>\n<p>A 2015 Economic Policy Institute survey reported 92 percent of California union workers struggle to provide for themselves or their families.</p>\n<p>The UC employees’ contract expired in November and representatives from each campus have been meeting with university administration to negotiate a new contract since April, but an agreement is yet to be reached.</p>\n<p>UC has proposed an 18 percent pay increase over the next six years, but union members are saying the increase is not substantial. Furthermore, a UC spokesperson said in October that the UC “heavily subsidizes the cost of healthcare for our workers,” with those in lower paid positions contributing “as little as $47 a month for health benefits for their entire family.” The UC additionally offers a pension program with guaranteed payments on retirement.</p>\n<p>Dissenters have called the strike unlawful, but Debbie Fingerle, chief steward of UCSB Teamsters, said the stalled contract negotiations have left employees working without a contract, so the no-strike clause does not apply.</p>\n<p>“They will not negotiate in good faith,” Jedediah Johnson, office manager of the Teamsters Local 186 of Ventura, said. “We need to be at the table … and we need to learn about the cost of living and how much it actually cost with food, families [and] regulations.”</p>\n<p>Food security is another concern of the union as they battle for higher wages. According to a 2016 survey done by Teamsters Local 2010 and Occidental College, 70 percent of clerical workers struggle to buy food and 45 percent are “food insecure” and often skip meals due to a lack of resources. The survey was sent to 13,661 UC employees, and their median wage was reported to be $22.65 per hour.</p>\n<p>Brian Harwell, union member and the undergraduate advisor for the Department of Theater and Dance, said he is concerned about employees who struggle to provide food for themselves and their families.</p>\n<p>“In a higher education environment that is expensive, where you have really high pay for certain people in the university, it just seems petty and brutal,” Harwell said.</p>\n<p>Harwell said clerical employees provide a “significant role” on UC campuses, and he wants the strike to encourage understanding of the work they provide for the university.</p>\n<p>“We’re classified as clerical, but there are certain people that run the department,” Harwell said. “We have our hands in all the nuts and bolts.”</p>\n<p>Union workers hope Tuesday’s demonstration will pressure the UC to reach a contract with the employees that fulfills their demands. According to Fingerle, the union members are close to the results they want and “just need to push a little bit further” for their wage increases.</p>\n<p>“[The university is] very slow in responding, which is part of the reason we’re striking,” Fingerle said. “On a whole, they do come back with something, but it’s just not enough, and they have what we need.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

annual 5 percent increase in tuition over the next five years due to a lack of state funding for the UC. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 150 students from several UC campuses gathered outside the UC Regents meeting Thursday in protest of a proposed tuition hike, forcing the Regents to table its approval until January.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents proposed a $280 annual tuition increase for UC students in order to fund more resources for the rising number of students attending UCs. Ralph Washington Jr., UC Davis UC Student Association President, and Erica Perez, UC Riverside Campus Action chair, planned a protest upon hearing of the increase.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Washington said the protest was successful in its goal to “bring attention to student perspective,” but the Regents’ decision will be unknown until the meeting in January.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest began at 8 a.m. with protestors gathered outside the building and chanting at the Regents as they entered. Protesters employed four basic tactics: a banner drop, human chain, spelling out S.O.S. and camping in tents outside the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure students are comfortable at all levels,” Erica Perez said. “Not everyone can come out to say what we do; we’re out there for those that can’t be there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure the wellbeing of students, a “wellness leader” handed out water and snacks to protesters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tensions increased during the meeting when Regents attempted to cut it short, much to the dismay of any protesters who had bussed overnight to attend the meeting. Regent John Perez suggested holding another open comment period to hear student concerns, but was denied.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Things could have easily been smoother if they allowed the students to make a public comment,” Erica Perez said. “They constantly make decisions for us; we need to be included in these conversations all the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hope is that we adopt a conversation,” Washington said. “Many students face basic needs insecurity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Food Security and Access Study conducted by the Regents found nearly 20 percent of students face food insecurity, with 42 percent of students in the UC system reporting they had experienced a decrease in quality or intake of food in the last 12 months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a conspicuous problem,” Washington said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have to either think about buying food or paying tuition,” Erica Perez said. “We should not be thinking about sacrificing things to get a higher education … our needs as students aren’t being met, and that’s what frustrates us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erica Perez and Washington both emphasized the importance of protesting to express student beliefs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I definitely believe that protests can have an affect on a political agenda, and sometimes this is what our education looks like,” Erica Perez said. “Organizing gives you a voice; protests are able to give you a voice where you can express yourself the way you want to.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest has been in the planning stages for two months, with weekly conference calls involving several students across the UC. Students discussed logistics and tactics to increase students’ comfort and efficiency as protestors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that’s beautiful, just to see that students are taking the time,” Erica Perez said in reference to the long meetings. “We don’t see it as work because, when you organize, it’s the passion, it’s something you love to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite Regents tabling the discussion on tuition hikes, the UCSB Student Activist Network will be holding a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/walkout-to-defy-possible-uc-tuition-hikes/\" target=\"_blank\"> walkout on Monday </a>to make a statement that tabling the discussion is not enough, and that students want a rollback on tuition prices. Students across the UC system will leave their classes, and students at UCSB will gather under Storke Tower to express their disapproval.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: The photo caption incorrectly said the protest was in 2015, not 2014. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Senate meeting two weeks ago to oppose the College Republicans event.</p>\n<p>Professors suggested creating a list of “sanctuary” faculty members who are available to support students who are distressed. The idea is modeled after the “sanctuary campus,” a symbolic designation with special powers.</p>\n<p>Sanctuary campuses can protect students from deportation, certain federal immigration laws and other threats, similar to sanctuary cities. The movement has emerged at Tufts, Rutgers, Yale, Stanford and several other universities after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, followed by multiple protests throughout the country.</p>\n<p>At an A.S. Senate meeting Tuesday, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez presented an alternative for students who didn’t wish to contribute to the College Republicans event.</p>\n<p>The Compulsory Fee Refund Application allows students to withdraw their portion of student funding from specific programs and is a product of a 1993 California Supreme Court Decision: Smith v. Regents.</p>\n<p>The court ruled in 1993 that the UC cannot force students to pay for events that pursue political or ideological goals through “compulsion and coercion.”</p>\n<p>“This specific ruling was obviously brought up at this specific meeting because one of the administrators who has a lot of ties with a lot of these left-leaning organizations,” Andrew Gates, College Republicans president, told the Nexus during the Senate meeting Wednesday, adding that the ruling could work against “left-leaning” events.</p>\n<p>“We have, what, one event per quarter? But if you divide 5,000 by 23,000 students … compare that with the countless left-leaning events that you know all the conservative students could, like, get a refund for,” he said.</p>\n<p>At the faculty meeting one hour prior, Sanchez quoted comments from the College Republican’s YouTube video of the Nov. 3 Senate meeting. The comments can only be removed by the owner of the account, or YouTube if the comments are reported.</p>\n<p>“Lets get these cunts. Comment a link to the BLM fascists facebook page, I’ll trigger these scumbags,” one comment reads.</p>\n<p>“Dis what fatherless iq 85 african americans been taught by iq 130 jews who think whites nazist. ethnic weapons,” read another comment on a repost of the video, which College Republicans cannot regulate. Ladijah Corder, co-chair of UCSB Black Student Union, later recited the same comment to the Senate during public forum.</p>\n<p>Tamara Afifi, professor of communication, said while advocacy may interrupt scholarly work, it is the responsibility of non-minorities to support activists. “It’s up to us,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of white people are scared to say something stupid; they’re scared to be vulnerable,” she said. “It’s not up to people of color to educate them, they have enough placed on them.”</p>\n<p>Armistead, who has been a vocal advocate of students who are against the College Republicans program, said “We need to take our campus back.”</p>\n<p>“I’m upset, too,” Armistead said. “It kills me because I’m the one who ultimately has to make this event successful.”</p>\n<p>Other faculty members built a suggestion list, including attending the event en masse to occupy seats and arguing with Ben Shapiro point by point during his lecture.</p>\n<p>Demetrius Ous, a UCSB graduate student, suggested planning counter events at the same time of the College Republicans events.</p>\n<p>“The point of these events is expressing joy and love for one another,” he said. “If you see hatred, you should show it a smile because hatred is going on.”</p>\n<p>The conversation culminated with an initial push to create buttons for faculty to wear during the event. The buttons would be emblems of inclusivity, saying “UCSB Against Hate.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Correction: The second comment was shared on a repost of the College Republicans’ video, not on the College Republicans account.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74307\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74307\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/","id":2440,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2439,2438,2437],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Goings-On in I.V.

Students who understand its distinct culture are able to fulfill I.V.’s demands through various entrepreneurial pursuits.</p>\n<p>David Welsh and Michael Bakkie, two fourth-year economics majors at UCSB, saw a gap in supply and demand: Students needed a way to get groceries but didn’t have access to a car, and they had to rely on friends to go to a grocery store.</p>\n<p>They began developing the plan for their delivery model two years ago, culminating in the creation of Isla Vista Grocery Delivery, founded earlier this November.</p>\n<p>The alternative to making commutes to grocery stores, Welsh said, was either going to local, “overpriced” I.V. stores, eating at restaurants or getting a meal plan, all of which are more expensive than “reasonable eating.”</p>\n<p>The combination of students’ lack of options and mobility created a space for opportunists like Welsh and Bakkie to provide a solution.</p>\n<p>“I have always dreamed of being an entrepreneur, and this was a great way to start in a local market that I really know very well because I am one of these college students that would use this service,” Welsh said.</p>\n<p>The way Welsh sees it, a trip to the grocery store takes about an hour to complete: One has to drive there, drive back and buy everything. To a lot of people, he said, the effort needed to deal with that hassle is worth about $10.</p>\n<p>“If we can streamline that process and do it for a lot of students, that’s good business,” he said. “We really think this will save students’ time and money in the long run.”</p>\n<p>Welsh believes a lot of students will get behind “a startup started by other Gauchos.”</p>\n<p>This entrepreneurial ambition is also what drove fourth-year UCSB student Reese Hammerstrom to launch his own delivery service, D.I.V.E., during the fall of last year.</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom said he came up with the business idea during the previous summer playing “Isla Vista’s sport” beer die.</p>\n<p>“Our die would keep bouncing off the balcony into the ocean and we would have to stop playing the game,” he said. “I was thinking of ways for a service where I could essentially press a button and dice would appear at my door.”</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom said he bought playing dice from Amazon that summer, delivered dice for a few weeks and, come Fall Quarter, realized there was opportunity to expand.</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom was able to pinpoint what I.V. needed through direct interaction with local culture and consequently developed a business model. He called the model D.I.V.E., an acronym for Delivering Isla Vista Entertainment.</p>\n<p>Though Hammerstrom began by delivering supplies such as dice, lighters, ping-pong balls, cups and “chasers” to his friends, he “realized there was a bigger opportunity to expand beyond party supplies.”</p>\n<p>Last summer, he partnered with I.V. Market and now delivers party supplies, ice cream, drinks, munchies, house supplies and school supplies, “essentially anything a college student could need with the exception of cooked food,” he said.</p>\n<p>D.I.V.E.’s Vice President of Operations, Robert Holland, said the company is all about giving customers “complete control of their time.”</p>\n<p>“Isla Vistans live an active lifestyle, and going to the store can be kind of a drag,” Holland said. “D.I.V.E. takes care of your everyday shopping needs, and for the fun times, D.I.V.E.’s got your dice, limes and Sprite, too.”</p>\n<p>Currently, delivery has been centered around a concentrated demand for Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, specifically the flavor “Half Baked.”</p>\n<p>“I think that’s just a factor of the current hours of operation. Right now we’re only open from 7:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. every night. That time kind of lends itself to ice cream and party supplies,” Hammerstrom said.</p>\n<p>There has been a particular surge in customer activity coming from the dorms, Hammerstrom said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really great for freshmen,” he said, “Most people in their first year usually don’t have access to cars and to all these supplies and ice cream, and so freshman now are just pretty stoked about this service.”</p>\n<p>UCSB student Kaitlyn Hague said she believes the need for delivery came from high demand, a lack of mobility and “student laziness.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve needed ice and dice last minute for parties, but some nights I’m just binge-watching Netflix and I really want ice cream without getting out of bed,” she said.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Sarah Cragin, another student user of delivery services, said she has used it for party supplies like alcohol chasers because “we don’t realize we need it until the last second.”</p>\n<p>As students who once needed services unavailable in I.V., Welsh, Bakkie and Hammerstrom self-serviced. They filled not only their own needs as community members but also capitalized on the gap between supply and demand in I.V.</p>\n<p>As long as students in I.V. sustain their unique desires, student entrepreneurs will find a way to bridge the town’s gap of service.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1,3 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74310\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74310\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/","id":4488,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[4487,4486,4485],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bins Seek To Salvage Surf Gear","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Surfrider Foundation will launch a coordinated project with nonprofit organization ReRip next quarter to collect and repurpose broken or unwanted surf equipment.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74262\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74262\" data-attachment-id=\"74262\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/surfbox-by-oliver-zuniga-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"surfbox-by-oliver-zuniga-online-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C671&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74262\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Surfbox-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-1-1024x774.jpg?resize=888%2C671\" alt=\"Hoping to finalize the project sometime during Winter Quarter, the I.V.

Surfrider Foundation, along with the nonprofit ReRip, will place bins on DP to collect and repurpose broken surfboards, wetsuits and other gear.<em> Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Surfrider Foundation will launch a coordinated project with nonprofit organization ReRip next quarter to collect and repurpose broken or unwanted surf equipment.</p>\n<p>The foundation intends to place a collection bin along the beachside intersections of Del Playa Drive for recycling all forms of damaged or used surf equipment.</p>\n<p>“The collection bin will be a physical emblem of Isla Vista sustainability efforts,” said Benny Drescher, an intern for I.V. Surfrider.</p>\n<p>The broken longboards, wetsuits and other surf gear will be distributed to artists and ReRip for repairs, and Drescher said ReRip will also use the materials to teach disadvantaged youth how to surf.</p>\n<p>According to ReRip’s website, the company salvages and reuses “everything from fins and broken bits to complete boards.” The company repairs “rideable boards” to be surfed again; some boards are resold and many are given away to schools, nonprofits and people in need.</p>\n<p>While the closest collection site to donate used surf materials is currently located in Ventura, the new collection bin initiative hopes to offer a more “accessible and convenient” means for student surfers to repurpose their trash.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) is still discussing procedures for maintaining the bins and managing their capacity.</p>\n<p>“The project needs stewardship,” said Dave Hubbard, director of the IVRPD, noting the tendency of “loose objects on Del Playa to get thrown off the cliff into the ocean.”</p>\n<p>At their board meeting on Nov. 10, the IVRPD Board of Directors voiced potential concerns about the project’s implementation, including the possibility of Isla Vista party-goers “pulling donations out and throwing them around the park,” or “setting the bin on fire.”</p>\n<p>“If the problem appears to be a reality, we can add a lock to the bins or erect a fence that will surround the bins,” said Surfrider organizers in their proposal. “Surfrider officers will frequently check the bins to organize materials and report to ReRip when a donation pickup is needed.”</p>\n<p>Together, I.V. Surfrider and IVRPD plan to make adjustments to the proposed wood box design and are considering incorporating surf and environmentalism-themed art on the bin’s frame to deter vandalism.</p>\n<p>With design proposals still underway, I.V. Surfrider aims to finalize the sustainability project by the middle of Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74315\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74315\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/","id":4487,"author":{"id":104,"name":"Aly Giammanco"},"related":[4486,4485,4484],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":85,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
