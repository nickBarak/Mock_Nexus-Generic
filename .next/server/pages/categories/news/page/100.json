Loan Program will provide undocumented UC students with federal financial aid for the first time. <em>Photo Courtesy of CaliforniaStateGearUp.org</em></p></div>\n<p>The University of California is rolling out its D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program this academic year, providing an initial $5 million in federal aid to undocumented students across the UC system.</p>\n<p>The aid will be distributed to 3,000 undocumented students and will include more than approximately $350,000 to UCSB students. The money comes equally from the California state general fund, and UC funds and will be distributed to campuses based on need.</p>\n<p>Habiba Simjee, Undocumented Student Services Coordinator at UCSB and Undocumented Legal Services Counsel, said the program was a significant step toward addressing the financial struggles of undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“The D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program is an important step in addressing the significant funding gap for undocumented students who wish to pursue their education at UC schools,” Simjee said. “It’s been very challenging and heartbreaking to hear from students who have to withdraw or drop out because they’re unable to make ends meet, particularly when we consider the cost of living in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Michael Miller, director of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at UCSB, said the goal of the program is to make education more affordable for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“The goal of all financial aid funding is to ensure access and affordability for all UCSB students,” Miller said. “This loan program will be one more resource our D.R.E.A.M. Scholars have available to them, and, given the work and loan commitment all UCSB students assume while they are here, it is going to play a huge part in their ability to finance their education.”</p>\n<p>The D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program, proposed by UC President Janet Napolitano, was passed in 2014, but funding was not available for students until the current academic school year. Miller said the program helps level the playing field.</p>\n<p>“The creation of the D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program is a big step forward for D.R.E.A.M. Scholars across California, and it gets us closer to making sure they have the same resources available to them that other students have,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Miller also made it clear that the University can do more for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“I am very proud of our campus, because our student leaders pushed for this program and their hard work paid off,” Miller said. “This program is a step in the right direction, but we still have a lot of work to do.”</p>\n<p>Claire Doan, a spokesperson for the UC Office of the President, said the program will help ease the financial burdens facing the undocumented student community.</p>\n<p>“The overall goal of the D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program is to help undocumented students who have limited financial options afford a UC education,” Doan said. “It helps alleviate the burden for undocumented UCSB students, many of whom are often forced to take semesters off or take outside jobs to offset the cost of tuition.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, the average UCSB student graduates with about $21,000 in student loan debt.</p>\n<p>“Student loans are widely used by students to pay for education-related expense like tuition and fees, room and board and books and supplies,” Miller said. “The D.R.E.A.M. Loan program will help eligible students meet these expenses.”</p>\n<p>Under current laws, undocumented students who graduate from high schools in California can apply for state and university aid, but their status as undocumented students prevents them from obtaining federal aid.</p>\n<p>Ricardo Leon, second-year computer engineering major, said he expects the D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program will help offset the lack of federal funding.</p>\n<p>“The program will help [undocumented students] because they’re not eligible for federal aid, so they don’t get the Cal Grant, and they also can’t get loans through the federal government,” Leon said. “Having the government give them some loan money would be really helpful.”</p>\n<p>Leon said the program would help undocumented students focus more on their education and less on their finances.</p>\n<p>“A lot of undocumented students have to get jobs in order to get that extra funding and make ends meet,” Leon said. “I think a loan would help them focus more on their studies.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Previously, UCSB students held a sit-in to establish a more concrete policy in regard to sexual violence procedures and policies. Though this policy has been implemented and revised, a meeting was held on Wednesday to consider how recent changes will affect the student body and student access to support programs. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Students, staff and administrators met in the UCen’s Santa Barbara Harbor Room on Wednesday to discuss recent changes to how UCSB will respond to reports of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The group focused on evaluating the recently implemented UC-wide Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy and how it will affect UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming began the discussion by explaining the purpose of the meeting.</p>\n<p>“Our goal from the staff side of things is just to make sure that we have an opportunity for regular communication, that we have an opportunity to sit down and hear from you about your ideas and thoughts on things, if there are concerns you think we need to beware of,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>Fleming said under UC policy, each campus has some freedom to determine implementation procedures.</p>\n<p>“That is actually something we have more control over are our own campus procedures, so we can go back, look at that and amend that,” Fleming said. “The policy is the policy for now. It has been embedded, system-wide it has been approved, it has been implemented as of Jan. 4, so we don’t have the ability to make any changes to the policy, but we do have the ability to make changes to the way we describe the implementation procedures, and we can clarify things that aren’t clear.”</p>\n<p>Briana Conway, victim advocacy specialist for C.A.R.E. Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct program at UCSB, said the policy is clear for reports of a student perpetrator, but other procedures need further specification.</p>\n<p>“I think phase two of that and ongoing will be really fleshing out what are the procedures when any one party is a non-affiliate and how do we work through next steps and action items as far as recording for that,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Timothy Irvine, vice president for Committees and Planning of the Graduate Students Association, said a flow chart for procedures on student reports could be useful.</p>\n<p>“If that could be adopted here and accessible, but accessible without students having to go into C.A.R.E., so on a website or something, so if something has happened they don’t necessarily have to go in and consult with someone to get clarity on what the process might look like. I think that would be great,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Irvine said websites explaining the procedures can potentially be difficult to navigate.</p>\n<p>“Certainly if you know how to navigate these things, you can find what to do depending on what your situation is, and if you go to C.A.R.E., it is really easy to report and call C.A.R.E. and go into C.A.R.E., but that is not necessarily what everyone wants to do.”</p>\n<p>Suzanne Perkin, assistant dean for student life at the Office of Judicial Affairs, said the C.A.R.E. Advocate Office is preparing a one-page document to distribute to students.</p>\n<p>“We are working on a summary and overview one-page document on this process, so that is something that could just be handed out,” Perkin said. “Then we were thinking about, on the back, putting the flow chart.”</p>\n<p>Conway said there should be a balance of transparency and privacy in the reporting and advocacy processes.</p>\n<p>“What is that happy medium? We can put it all out there for transparency, and, yes, I fully support that. But I don‘t want it to ever lose the beautiful bond that an advocate can provide and help a survivor navigate their options,” Conway said. “That is the core value of why I wake up every morning.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-67905\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The general consensus on RateMyProfessor.com is, although the website can be a helpful tool, students’ decisions should not be based solely on others’ experiences. <em>Photo Courtesy of RateMyProfessors.org</em></p></div>\n<p>RateMyProfessors.com allows students to anonymously evaluate professors on a five-point scale for categories like helpfulness, clarity and even their professor’s “hotness.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB students are familiar with the site, and some even rely on it to decide between classes, what do their professors think? The Nexus interviewed some highly rated instructors to see what they think about the website.</p>\n<p>Communication professor Desiree Aldeis, who scores a 4.9, said she feels the website is a helpful tool for students, provided they “take it with a grain of salt” and remember the evaluations are subjective.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a useful tool that students can utilize to make better choices and more informed choices for the classes that they sign up for,” Aldeis said. “And I think students are also aware that these are their peer’s opinions and their peer’s experiences might be different from their own.”</p>\n<p>Aldeis said that the website is also useful to professors so that they can see what aspects of their teaching style are and aren’t working for students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important that professors get on there and read what their students say about them because there may be some things that you don’t know you’re doing that are not working well for your audience,” Aldeis said. “I feel like it’s a lot of information for us as professors in terms of how we can maybe improve or even the things we can continue to keep doing.”</p>\n<p>German professor Evelyn Reder, who also scores a 4.9, said students should avoid choosing courses based on the subjective reviews of others.</p>\n<p>“There must be some truth to it, but you also don’t know — it’s so individual and so subjective,” Reder said. “To be sure, you have to try them out, you can’t really base it on someone else’s judgment, so it’s probably not the best way of picking a class.”</p>\n<p>Reder also said the website tends to only attract students with very extreme opinions.</p>\n<p>“I kind of feel from what I’ve seen that only students that really love you or really hate you will write a review and everybody in the middle kind of doesn’t really bother,” Reder said. “I try to do my best, I try to really take my students’ voices into account and try to be there for them, but I think in every class you have students that love you and students that don’t like you so much.”</p>\n<p>Emma Levine, a graduate student studying music, is a teaching assistant with a perfect five rating on the site. She said students should be wary of personal evaluations, because students may form strong opinions about professors based on little experience.</p>\n<p>“I did find as an undergrad that it’s useful so students can report on things like here’s how many tests there are, how many quizzes or papers or how the class is run,” Levine said. “As far as kind of personal evaluations, it’s sort of hit or miss — you can get a student who just has one very strange interaction with the professor and then just hates them forever.”</p>\n<p>That said, Levine said a teacher can make or break a class.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a TA for music appreciation class here. I’ve also taught the class, and depending on who’s teaching it, it’s a completely different class,” Levine said. “I think if you have a really great teacher, it almost doesn’t matter what they’re teaching, it’s going to be a good class.”</p>\n<p>While some student’s opinions may not be representative, Aldeis said, evaluations with a number of negative comments are often accurate.</p>\n<p>“It may be the case that one student had a very negative experience so they use that platform to vocalize it or voice their frustrations and things like that,” Aldeis said. “But … when you read multiple comments and they’re all saying the same thing, more or less, or have the same kind of theme to each one of them, then I don’t think that’s a sign of unfairness or inaccuracy. If anything I think that’s something that students should really consider.”</p>\n<p>Eric Engel, a chemistry tutor with Campus Learning Assistance Services (C.L.A.S.), has a 4.9 rating and criticized the website’s “easiness” rating.</p>\n<p>“With teachers being rated on easiness, I think that’s kind of a reflection of students not taking classes seriously or not really knowing that being forced to work is going to help them,” Engel said. “Maybe they’re seeing classes as a hurdle or obstacle to take to get to their degree and not really appreciating the benefit of hard work.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Britteny Young said she may look for a high “easiness” rating when choosing general education or prerequisite classes but would not do the same for classes within her major.</p>\n<p>“I’m a psych major, so math isn’t really my thing, so if I can find a teacher that’s reported to be easy then, yeah,” Young said. “But for my major requirements, I don’t think that’s a positive cause I’m paying for it, so might as well get the best.”</p>\n<p>Young said that overall she feels like RateMyProfessor.com evaluations are generally accurate and are useful for both students and professors.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great idea,” Young said. “Obviously there’s extreme responses from people — either you loved it or you hated it — but I think overall you get a really good feel for the class. I think it’s good for teachers to look at it — sometimes they can be in their own worlds.”</p>\n<p>Rubí Rodríguez, a fourth-year political science major, said she would never use the website because she wants to form her own opinions.</p>\n<p>“If it works, it works, but I’ve never used it or thought about using it just because I don’t like to have or be stopped from taking a class or professor because the ratings are wrong,” Rodríguez said. “That way, I can choose for myself and not come out with an idea that doesn’t necessarily apply to me.”</p>\n<p>Rodríguez said that choosing a professor based on easiness also sometimes makes sense, because students have to consider how their choices will affect their GPA.</p>\n<p>“I think as a college student, what you want is to succeed,” Rodriguez said. “And I think with easiness you think ‘Ok I can excel. I can raise that GPA and fulfil this credit.’”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

the sixth president of Pitzer College this summer and the first African American to ever be appointed president of one of the five undergraduate colleges of the Claremont University Consortium.</p>\n<p>Oliver has served more than thirty years in the University of California, first as a professor of sociology at UCLA and then as the dean of social sciences at UCSB beginning in 2008. Throughout his career, Oliver strove to create opportunities for minorities in UC, co-founding the UCLA Center for Study of Urban Poverty, and overseeing the creation of Chican@ studies, feminist studies and global studies Ph.D. programs during his tenure at UCSB. Before coming to UCSB, Oliver served as Vice-President of the Asset Building and Community Development Program at the Ford Foundation, where he developed a grant program to provide 35,000 low-wealth households with secure home mortgages and to change the way banks assess home mortgage applicants.</p>\n<p>Oliver has received multiple distinguished awards and fellowships in recognition of his work in higher education and philanthropy, including the Rockefeller Foundation Research Fellowship, National Science Foundation Research Initiation Planning Grant and more than $5 million in research support from NSF, Ford, Rockefeller, Russell Sage, Haynes, and the Social Science Research Council. During his time at UCLA, he was named the California Professor of the Year for his “extraordinary dedication to teaching and commitment to students.”</p>\n<p>Having earned his bachelor of arts at William Penn College in 1972, Oliver said he is both elated and honored to have been named president of an institution like Pitzer, which has “all of the characteristics of a great liberal arts college” that he admires.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wanted to go back to my roots,” Oliver said. “The liberal arts was a transformative experience for me … it was the kind of place that encouraged my creativity, it was the kind of place that nurtured my intellectual curiosity and it gave me leadership opportunities to grow and develop.”</p>\n<p>Oliver said his appointment as the first African American president of an undergraduate Claremont college motivates him to create “ladders of opportunity” for those who come from backgrounds similar to his own.</p>\n<p>“In a lot of things I’ve done I’ve been the first. The first only means that you have to create the ladders of opportunity for other to follow. It’s not about you, it’s about what you can do for others,” Oliver said. “I see it as one of my responsibilities to create those ladders of opportunity so other students of color, other professors of color, other really disadvantaged folks can also have the same opportunities I’ve had.”</p>\n<p>Oliver said he was attracted to Pitzer because it reflects his own values, such as commitment to diversity, environmental sustainability and education geared toward social impact.</p>\n<p>“Those are all values that I’ve promoted in my life, into my work, and I think Pitzer is the kind of place I can go to and help them double down on some of those concerns they have — some of those issues that they’re grappling with,” Oliver said.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Pitzer is fortunate to have Oliver, as he is a “seasoned administrator” who possesses unique leadership skills.</p>\n<p>“His vision and leadership have shaped the academic profile of social sciences at UC Santa Barbara, and he has been exemplary in advancing our commitment to diversity among students, faculty, and staff,” Yang said in an email. “Dean Oliver’s upcoming departure is a bittersweet moment for our university. We are immensely proud of his success, yet we regret losing a dear colleague and friend.”</p>\n<p>Donald Gould, a Pitzer trustee and head of the presidential search committee, said it took nearly a year to systematically narrow down the approximately 300 applicants, before the Pitzer board of trustees selected from among the final candidates. The board valued Oliver’s administrative and teaching background, as well as his time outside of the academic world, according to Gould.</p>\n<p>“The board has to select the individual that they feel in all respects, including temperament, experience, judgment, is the best person for the job, and I think that all of those things together led to our putting Melvin Oliver at the top of our list,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>Gould said the board took note of Oliver’s “heart for undergraduate education” and the impact of his own liberal arts educational experience as transformative.</p>\n<p>“Even within the large university settings at UCLA and UCSB he’s always been a champion of liberal arts education,” Gould said. “So certainly it will be a different environment than the large University of California environment, but we think that the things he’s learned in the UC system can only be beneficial to us.”</p>\n<p>On a broader stage, Oliver said he aims to promote the liberal arts educational environment as one that prepares students for the future.</p>\n<p>“We sometimes push for our students to be concerned with that first job out of college. We bemoan that the liberal arts isn’t allowing people to have those $100,000 a year jobs,” Oliver said. “But what we do create in the liberal arts are people who can be engaged citizens … We’re not about the first job, we’re about the last job. We’re about what you’re going to grow into.”</p>\n<p>Oliver said while he is leaving the UC system, he is hopeful both the California legislature and Governor Jerry Brown will continue to recognize the importance of investing in the UC.</p>\n<p>“The University of California, even with its problems, is still the most important mobility ladder for the state of California,” Oliver said. “The UC will continue to be the leader in doing that and I just hope that they can see the value in investing in UC. When we invest in UC, we invest in the future.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/","id":2567,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2566,2565,2564],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The UUT would provide $512,000 for services in I.V., ranging from administrative positions to a parking plan.</p>\n<p>The CSD administration is expected to receive an estimated $257,000 from the budget. This will include an IVCSD general manager to oversee public engagements and contracts for services, as well as the implantation of programs decided by the board of directors.</p>\n<p>Lanny Ebenstein, UCSB professor of economics, said he was unsure if the general manager would be a part-time position.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if there is going to be basically one full-time person, because the clerical is part-time and the transaction is part-time, and the recourse development person is part-time,” Ebenstein said.</p>\n<p>The general manager would have a salary of $162,500 and a part time clerical staff would receive compensation of $31,250 and other office expenses.</p>\n<p>Ebenstein said the salary of the general manager would be too costly for the budget.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure if that is the amount required to get someone to fill the responsibilities of the general manager of IVCSD,” Ebenstein said. “I think that is something that merits further consideration … there might be other comparable positions in I.V. I think the figure is too high given the budget.”</p>\n<p>LuAnn Miller, the Executive Director of Isla Vista Youth Projects, said an eight percent tax could be a concern for voters, especially with the addition of a new administrative position.</p>\n<p>“I wonder about any intentional kickback from voters who are going to be looking at this and say, ‘You’re asking us to add this utility tax and part of it would go to administration. I won’t be voting on that,’” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Ken Masuda, a volunteer with Assemblymember Das Williams’s office, said the $30,000 allotted for improved I.V. parking will benefit current and future residents because it will present a new plan based on the size of groups of individuals who park in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think the parking study we want is going to be a little different in the sense that when we were discussing parking, we made a list of groups we wanted to have parking and a list of groups we want to discourage from parking,” Masuda said. “But we don’t know anything about the size of any of those groups.”</p>\n<p>According to Masuda, understanding the sizes of the different groups of people who park in I.V. would be useful for the Community Service District (CSD) in planning better parking.</p>\n<p>“One thing [that] would be helpful for the CSD-sponsored parking study is to try to get at what are the sizes of those different groups,” Masuda said. “And so in that way, the cost of the study could be more when you’re trying to get that level of detail.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, field representative for Assemblymember Das Williams’ office, said visual changes in the community would show taxpayer money directly at work.</p>\n<p>“Sidewalks, lighting, and trees are some of the most immediately visual impacting things you see in a community, and it may serve the CSD well to be able to do small projects that have striking visual impact,” Schunk said. “That way, people associate that with the work the district is doing.”</p>\n<p>The other services in the budget amounted to $204,000.

Yang recognized the passing of UCSB faculty members, including Otis Madison, a professor in the Department of Black Studies, and said Madison’s time at UCSB was impactful.</p>\n<p>“He lectured on campus for almost 40 years and was very inspiring,” Yang said. “People remember him very well.”</p>\n<p>Yang also took the time to recognize the passing of important alumnus Jim Barber, who is responsible for the idea of the Gaucho Reunion, a sort of homecoming weekend that over 10,000 UCSB alumni attend annually.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the application rates for incoming 2016 freshmen were the highest and most competitive to date. Yang called the freshman application pool the “most important item” of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Yang attributed lower past application rates to the events of May 23 in 2014, but said that the increase in this year’s applicants demonstrates that the school’s reputation is recovering.</p>\n<p>“This is something we have been focusing our efforts towards and represents a victory for us,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Yang said the number of applicants increased 9.3 percent from last year, a remarkable rise compared to the rest of the UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“[This is] the highest increase in applicants — aside from Merced, which is still growing — among all UC campuses,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>There were a total of 77,090 applicants for Fall 2016, 42 percent of which had a high school GPA of 4.0 or higher.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn spoke on a variety of initiatives, including the integration of a transfer student support center on campus that will be in the new library.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said she is proud of UCSB’s diversity.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that excited me most about coming to work at UCSB was the dedication the faculty puts forth to encourage full diversity of the student body,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>Academic Senate Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani discussed Wednesday’s Associated Students Senate meeting, the UC Board of Regents proposal to increase off-campus housing funding and nonresident tuition costs, for which a bill is currently being drafted.</p>\n<p>Bhavnani said the Board of Regents has worked with UC campuses to complete projects.</p>\n<p>“Word on the street is, if the Regents can handle all the complications of UCLA’s structures, then it can handle us,” Bhavnani said.</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate will hold its next meeting in early March.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

At one point, student protesters wearing duct tape over their mouths went inside the Career Fair and blocked the path to the CBP booth before being directed by protest organizers to return outside and continue chanting.</p>\n<p>Lorena Alvarez, second-year English major and publicity co-chair of the Associated Students Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee, helped organize the event and said she was inspired by the students who participated.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been working tirelessly with the coalition that essentially planned this protest,” Alvarez said. “I’m very proud to have taken part in the planning and I’m just inspired by all the people who came out today and the fact that we were able to make our presence known.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the event was meant to serve as a message that the university should stand by its status as a Hispanic-Serving Institution.</p>\n<p>“As a Hispanic-Serving Institute, I feel like we should stick by that name and have students feel safe on this campus,” Alvarez said. “By having Customs and Border Patrol on campus, they absolutely do not feel safe; a lot of my friends were triggered today and I blame Career Services and the university for not protecting them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67778\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67778\" data-attachment-id=\"67778\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/protest_by-andrew-gates-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Career Fair Protest\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67778\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Andrew Gates / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67778\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Andrew Gates / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Clinton Cox, a supervisory border patrol agent of Customs and Border Protection, said CBP was at the Career Fair to provide information and opportunities to interested students, and that CBP’s goal is to defend American borders.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to offer advice and potential career opportunities to all the students who are interested here,” Cox said. “We’re America’s front-line defense against terrorists and terrorist weapons, and we try to prevent the illegal flow of illicit material and/or narcotics and contraband, and to facilitate trade.”</p>\n<p>Outside the MCC, four protesters covered in fake blood lay motionless on the ground, representing the undocumented migrants who died trying to cross the border into the United States. Around them, protesters yelled, “¡La gente unida jamás será vencida!” meaning “The people united will never be defeated!”</p>\n<p>Juan Gonzalez, fourth-year economics and accounting major, said the protest was an affirmation of human rights.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously a good thing because we’re protesting human rights violations,” Gonzalez said. “There’s a lot of people who die trying to cross the border, trying to have a better life, and these immigration officers make it harder than it’s supposed to be, so I think it’s good to bring attention to these issues.”</p>\n<p>About three hours into the event, protesters marched into the MCC and stood in front of the CBP booth, holding up signs and wearing duct tape over their mouths, before being directed by protest organizers to return outside and continue chanting.</p>\n<p>Cox said CBP was not upset by the protest and encouraged peaceful demonstration.</p>\n<p>“They have a belief that they believe in, and they don’t necessarily believe in the mission that we are tasked to do,” Cox said. “As long as it’s a peaceful demonstration, it doesn’t bother us one bit, and we encourage people to exercise their first amendment right.”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the event, tensions flared as a number of students with dissenting opinions arrived outside the MCC to talk with some of the protest’s supporters.</p>\n<p>Jason Garshfield, fourth-year political science major, said he felt the protest was ineffective in creating a discussion about immigration laws.</p>\n<p>“They’re angry that CBP is having a booth at the Career Fair, and I think that’s somewhat silly because those agents aren’t here to deport anyone,” Garshfield said. “I don’t totally approve of our immigration laws—I think they need to be reformed and I think that that’s a legitimate debate—but when you get 100 people together chanting the same slogan, that’s not something that’s encouraging debate.”</p>\n<p>Rick Zierer, first-year political science major, said enforcement of American borders is necessary.</p>\n<p>“In a society, you have to enforce laws, and those laws exist, be they just or unjust,” Zierer said. “There are ways that we can look about maybe making legal immigration easier. We can look at more common-sense solutions than just allowing no enforcement of the border, which potentially could be very harmful to the migrants themselves.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, Associated Students senator and third-year Chican@ studies and sociology double major, helped organize the event and said the protest showcased the need for the university to provide more resources to the undocumented community.</p>\n<p>“I believe we need to support the undocumented community because they need more resources on our campus,” Melgoza said. “And as a research institution, we should able to provide the services that we need for our community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Photo</p></div>\n<p>California State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) recently introduced Senate Bill 900 (SB 900), known as the Coastal Oil Well Cleanup Act.</p>\n<p>SB 900 would require the California State Lands Commission to plug old oil wells in California waters “orphaned” by oil companies that go out of business and cease to be held responsible. The bill calls for an in-depth study of abandoned and unused oil wells concentrated along the Summerland and Ellwood beaches in Santa Barbara County.<br>\nJackson said the bill was inspired by a recent influx of oil onto Summerland Beach, leading to health warnings and beach closures over the past year.</p>\n<p>“This bill is a direct response to the issues we’ve been dealing with in Summerland in the oil fields there, [particularly] as a result of the Becker on-shore well which has been a problem in the Summerland area for decades,” Jackson said. “It was a well that was abandoned many years ago and was improperly capped.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, failure to properly cap the Becker on-shore well has been causing problems that affect the surrounding ocean and beaches.</p>\n<p>“This past year, it was leaking so measurably that it was creating all sorts of problems both in terms of odor it was emitting, and the crude oil that was finding its way onto the beaches and making it difficult for people to enjoy the beaches and the ocean,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the bill would allow the state to learn more about other oil wells along the California coast and about the issue of natural seepage.</p>\n<p>“This legislation requires that we study these wells to find out which ones are leaking and what it will take to cap them,” Jackson said. “Also importantly, we will study the whole issue of natural seepage to determine if there is any or more than a relatively absorbable amount.”</p>\n<p>Jackson also said SB 900 would ensure that State Lands Commission receive the funds and resources necessary to learn more about abandoned wells and cap-leaking wells.</p>\n<p>“If State Lands, which has the jurisdiction, fails to get the funding they need to cap this particular well, we will insure somewhere in the process, sooner rather than later frankly, we’ll be able to obtain the funds necessary in order to cap that well,” Jackson said. “It also gives State Lands the authority to do an analysis on the nearly 200 abandoned wells along the coast.”</p>\n<p>SB 900 is the beginning of a continuing effort to combat uncapped oil wells among the California coast, according to Jackson.</p>\n<p>“This [bill] is the beginning of the effort. If we achieve a regular funding mechanism, we hope we can address at least $2 million worth of the problem and perhaps more as we know exactly the full extent of the problem,” Jackson said. “The full time frame is yet unknown because we don’t know the full extent of the problem.”<br>\nJackson said she hopes to move the bill through the process and to the governor’s desk by the end of the 2016 State Senate session, in September.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

impossible for anyone to see or hear what was happening within the space” because of foliage that stretched for about a block. Satellite images from Google Earth show that a significant number of trees and shrubbery were removed within six months of the attack, making the location more visible from bordering bike paths and the corner of El Colegio Road and Stadium Road.</p>\n<p>Attorneys Tyrone Maho and Joshua Lynn are representing the female victim, whom the lawsuit refers to as Jane Doe, against the University of California Regents.

The lawsuit alleges that the UCSB Police Department was “understaffed and insufficiently trained” to investigate the attack.</p>\n<p>“We are dismayed that [UCPD has] not been able to find the suspects and the longer this goes on, the more difficult this is going to be,” Maho said. “Bringing this to the public’s attention by the way of the lawsuit, this will hopefully bring some witnesses forward who have some sort of information.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuit says a rape kit was performed shortly after the assault, but that it is “missing significant documentation” and does not include photos of the student’s injuries.</p>\n<p>The victim is requesting damages from the university but has not specified an amount. When a number is known, the lawsuit states, the plaintiff will “amend this Complaint and allege said amounts.”</p>\n<p>Maho and Lynn are representing the victim on a contingency basis, meaning they will not be paid for their time unless the victim is rewarded.</p>\n<p>UCSB released a statement Wednesday in response to the lawsuit, saying the safety of students is the university’s highest priority and that student cases are treated with “survivor-centered” support.</p>\n<p>“While we cannot pretend to comprehend the depth of pain and anguish our student has endured, we continue to offer our heartfelt sympathy and unwaveringly and persistently provide as much support as we possibly can,” the statement reads. “While this remains an active and ongoing criminal investigation, our campus would like to again ask the community to report any information related to this incident.”</p>\n<p>A representative from attorney Jonathan Miller’s office, based in Santa Barbara, confirmed that Miller is defending the university in this lawsuit, but offered no additional comment.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Police Department, UC Office of the President and UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>An initial conference between lawyers is scheduled for May 27 in front of Judge Donna Geck.</p>\n<p>Anyone with information is encouraged to call

to raise money for solar panels for the Isla Vista Food Co-op as part of their goal to improve sustainability in the community.</p>\n<p>The Solar Ambassadors program is a college-campus extension of the San Francisco based nonprofit, RE-volv. Students from different colleges and universities annually organize, develop and fundraise for a solar energy project in their communities. UCSB’s chapter is gaining momentum this year and plans to run its crowdfunding campaign for at least six weeks.</p>\n<p>Project leader and third-year environmental studies major Kaylan Lamb said she became involved with Solar Ambassadors when a professor of a class she took last year encouraged students to apply.</p>\n<p>“We had an email from our professor to get interests together, and then we made up a team and applied,” Lamb said. “And you have to sign a local nonprofit or cooperative that owns their own building and that could potentially get solar panels on their building.”</p>\n<p>Lamb said the Solar Ambassadors program only works with nonprofits and cooperatives.</p>\n<p>“It’s only nonprofits and co-ops because they usually don’t have the type of funds and can’t get the type of financing in order to afford solar on their own, so that’s where we come in,” Lamb said. “We decided on the I.V. Food Co-op because they’re really interested and had just gotten a new roof installed. It’s perfect timing.”</p>\n<p>Lamb said there there will be a launch event for the campaign in early February at the Co-op.</p>\n<p>“We have a few events planned,” Lamb said. “One of them is the launch event that will be held at the Co-op to get the word out to the community and target the student population that comes in and out of the Co-op as well as the adult population that also shops there.”</p>\n<p>Team member and fourth-year environmental science major Ingrid Medina said the project will help educate the community on the positive impact of solar energy.</p>\n<p>“It’s really good to show people that it’s possible to be sustainable and also promote renewable energy,” Medina said. “We want to educate on how much of an impact it’s going to make.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Olivia Godfrey said she is happy to be part of the Solar Ambassadors team because of its promotion of community-wide sustainability.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited to get involved with a project of this scale because it’s promoting sustainability in a way that’s pretty attainable for both students and the community,” Godfrey said. “I feel like a lot of people get the sense that solar is more like a private thing … but this project really goes to show that it can be a group effort to make something big happen.”</p>\n<p>Co-op General Manager Melissa Cohen said the project is not only about increasing solar energy use, but also about members of the community coming together to affect change.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about the panels, which are an obviously great addition to our store,” Cohen said. “The method by which RE-volv makes their projects happen is directly in line with our people-powered, community-owned grocery store.”</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, the project will succeed if the community comes together to support the cause of clean energy.</p>\n<p>“It’s totally based in people believing in the project and helping steward it into existence,” Cohen said. “This is how movements begin, and how communities can become more and more healthy as people being to see that they’re part of something bigger than themselves.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 version of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room to discuss an unprecedented situation regarding the status of an off-campus senator who moved to an on-campus apartment.</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, off-campus senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major, reported to have moved from an off-campus apartment in Isla Vista into the “on-campus” Sierra Madre apartments. Under these circumstances, Melgoza does not represent her constituency because she is not living off-campus. A.S. Senate discussed whether Melgoza should resign and reapply to the other two open senate positions, if they should vote to make an exception to the bylaws or change the A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>Kimia Hashemian, A.S. internal vice president and fourth-year sociology major, said the legal code is “unclear” and does not provide guidelines on what do if a senator’s situation changes to one in which they do not represent their constituency.</p>\n<p>“It does say you have to remain in your constituency, but it never explains what to do in unforeseen circumstances where you have to move or what’s going to happen with the new undergraduate housing,” Hashemian said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she has been looking for alternative housing for the past three weeks, and the Sierra Madre apartments ended up being her “only” choice.</p>\n<p>“I asked the university for help. The only thing that they could offer me was Sierra Madre apartments,” Melgoza said. “I did discuss with administration, and I did discuss this with the Vice Chancellor, that I am an off-campus senator, that I was worried about what would happen with my position.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said senate has the option to change the A.S. Legal Code to fit Melgoza’s situation or make a “one time exception” to have Melgoza keep her senate seat.</p>\n<p>“It’s up to you all to make that definition and you all can make the motion to allow Senator Melgoza be an off-campus senator, even though she’s living in Sierra Madre while you all make changes to bylaws,” Hashemian said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67717\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67717\" data-attachment-id=\"67717\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/senate-considers-situation-of-on-campus-senator-in-university-apartments-more/senate_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67717\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67717\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When the senate motioned to let the off-campus senator remain in Senate despite constituency issues, a hand vote of 10-3-8 stopped the motion from passing.</p>\n<p>Senate discussed Melgoza switching to one of the two vacant senate seats, an on-campus senator position and a letters and science senator, but was rejected since it would violate the elections code.</p>\n<p>Niki Elyasi, A.S. senator and second-year biopsychology major, said she will motion to table the approval in order for Melgoza to write a proposal describing how she will continue to serve her off-campus constituency while living on-campus.</p>\n<p>“I motion to table the approval for a week until we get a proposal from Senator Melgoza and then decide next week whether or not she should be sworn in or just switched I guess, or do nothing,” Elyasi said. “With the stipulation that Senator Melgoza will write a proposal on how she will represent off campus students while living in a university owned apartment.”</p>\n<p>The motion was passed in a unanimous decision.</p>\n<p>Alexander Bates, A.S. senator and second-year history major, was appointed to the Finance and Business committee.

The food cart will be primarily run by university student employees Monday through Friday and be under the same regulation as other restaurants on campus. The organization will be picking the menu based on the most popular food items sold at their monthly food tasting events.</p>\n<p>Laney Ennis, fourth-year environmental studies major, said the organization’s goal is to have generous portions with affordable prices for students.</p>\n<p>“We want it to be food that can fill somebody up,” Ennis said. “Our number one priority is that it’s local, and we make sure that everything we use is organic.”</p>\n<p>Ennis said she took over Isla Carte after the organization’s leaders graduated last year, to provide students with healthy and local food options.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our farming system is really messed up and really dominated by these huge corporations,” Ennis said. “I really wanted to do something that brings back local farms and more sustainable agriculture and gives students an on-campus option for that.”</p>\n<p>Ennis said one of the organization’s goals is to lower prices for sustainable food through seasonal shopping to avoid paying extra for imported foods, cutting back on meat and buying “ugly” fruits and vegetables.</p>\n<p>“It really doesn’t have to be more expensive and we’re basically going to be doing the work for you,” Ennis said. “We’re going to be looking at what the cheapest sustainable foods are, because we really want to bring prices down to something that all students can afford.”</p>\n<p>Ennis said while most of their food is sourced from I.V. Co-op, Isla Carte is trying to build relationships with local farmers.</p>\n<p>“When we think about what we want to serve, there are so many aspects to look at. You can look at water use, how far it had to be transported, what chemical fertilizers they’re using,” Ennis said. “That’s where a lot of the thinking and menu-planning has to come in. We can do that so you don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>Austen Trout, second-year physics major, said he respects the group’s mission but personally does not care about the origins of his food ingredients.</p>\n<p>“It seems like they have good intentions, and they’re trying to do something that is unique,” Trout said. “As long as my food doesn’t kill me, I’m fine with it. I’m not that picky about where it comes from or who made it.”</p>\n<p>Michael Lin, second-year theater major, said the most accessible eating choice for sustainable food is the dining commons.</p>\n<p>“The dining commons have taken strides to becoming healthier and more sustainable, but going another full step forward would be great … if it’s maybe cheaper than the dining meal plans,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>Alexa Rogalski, second-year biology major, said she thinks the food cart is a “great idea” and will broaden the selection of food available on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good option for people who don’t like the food on campus. I don’t feel like the food on campus is really healthy, so having a healthy option would be awesome,” Rogalski said. “If it’s sustainable that’s an even bigger plus.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A

Barbara County Board of Supervisors allocated $128,000 in contingency funds last week for additional shelter services for the approximately 1,400 homeless individuals seeking refuge from El Niño rain storms.</p>\n<p>Proposed by County Supervisors Doreen Farr and Steve Lavagnino, the two-fold project allocates $91,000 for two daytime shelter locations and provides $37,000 for night warming centers to be available an additional 15 nights. The five warming centers, including the Isla Vista location at the University Methodist Church, have already been activated 27 out of the planned 50 nights across the county, compared to 13 nights this time last year.</p>\n<p>Farr said addressing the needs of the homeless residents could not be put off due to predictions of increasingly poor weather over the next several months.</p>\n<p>“People need to be cared for sooner, rather than later, so that they don’t get sick. In some cases with the homeless, they will die on the street if they’re not cared for,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office volunteer chaplain, also said the homeless are at risk in the winter weather.</p>\n<p>“We may not have snow and frostbite here, but it gets pretty close to it, and sooner or later that takes a toll,” Hedges said. “That’s why so many of the folks … died way before, some of them in their late 20s.”</p>\n<p>The warming centers, active Nov. 15 through Mar. 31, provide shelter from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. on nights when the overnight temperature drops below 35 degrees, there is a 50 percent chance of rain predicted for two consecutive nights or a 50 percent chance of temperatures less than 40 degrees for two consecutive nights. According to Farr, the day shelter program was developed to provide a companion piece to the warming centers.</p>\n<p>“That system has worked very well, but there was a concern that that wasn’t enough, that we needed something during the day,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>The day shelters will likely be located at Earl Warren Showgrounds and at Santa Maria’s Minami Center in North County. While these locations are less easily accessible than the five warming centers across the county, Farr said a form of transportation may be provided to shuttle homeless residents to the day centers.</p>\n<p>“We did work with some transit providers, like Easy Lift, to say if we’re able to get these day shelters up and running. If people need assistance in getting there … the people at the warming shelter at night when they’re released at 6 in the morning, we could provide a shuttle service from the warming center locations to the closest day center,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Junior Anguiano, Community Affairs Board hunger/houseless co-coordinator and second-year film and media studies and psychology double major, said it is important to provide transportation for the homeless.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them have everything they own on a bike, and you can’t just throw that on a bus and go downtown and have to make that trek,” Anguiano said. “There is no established shelter in I.V. other than the warming center.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while Reverend Frank Schaefer has been very gracious to open up the University Methodist church as a warming center, the issue of shelter for the homeless individuals in I.V. is about more than just “ducking in to get a dry place to sleep.”</p>\n<p>“The solution really is finding a place, helping us find a place, agitating with us to find a place,” Hedges said. “Also, volunteering with things like Doctors Without Walls, student health outreach, SWIPES.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said he also encourages students, when they feel safe, to reach out to homeless individuals in I.V. in small ways.</p>\n<p>“If nothing else, maybe buying somebody a cup of coffee, giving them a justification for being in the Starbucks,” Hedges said. “You know, you see some guy there cold and wet, buy him a cup of coffee.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said he wants UC Santa Barbara to “step up as a neighbor” in finding a long-term solution for housing those living on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Long range, the University is building all kinds of stuff here … In all of that development I hope there is some provision for the poor among us,” Hedges said. “Some of the [homeless] folks that have died on the street here started out as students at UCSB … I’m not looking for anyone to come riding in with a bag full of money, but at least let’s be part of the plan together.”</p>\n<p>Anguiano also said the homeless community of I.V. is very different than that of cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco and students should take the time to hear their stories and share their own.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them come here because they want to hear what college students have to say or the things we’re thinking about,” Anguiano said. “Just talking with them … one-on-one getting to know them, like you’d get to know anyone. Just because they’re houseless doesn’t take away their humanity.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67741\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67741\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/","id":3870,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3869,3868,3867],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Regents Discuss Roles, Recruitment","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Student Regent Abraham “Avi” Oved and Student Regent-designate Marcela Ramirez visited UCSB on Tuesday where they held an informational session regarding their roles, the Student Regent recruitmen...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67641\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67641\" data-attachment-id=\"67641\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/student-regents-discuss-roles-recruitment/regents_by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Regents_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67641\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Student Regent Avi Oved and Student Regent-designate Marcela Ramirez visit all UC campuses to inform students about their position.
