As crowds grew to 25,000 in 1991 and then made a massive leap to 40,000 attendees in 1992, according to the Office of Student Life, the number of accidents, crimes, violations and arrests increased as well. After this drastic surge in attendance, local law enforcement drafted a “Five Year Plan” to help limit the number of party-goers who would flood I.V. the following year in 1993. Similar to the restrictions we see today, the plan came equipped with noise ordinances, confiscation of possibly dangerous props or costumes, barricades and restricted parking, with aims to improve the safety of the community and keep things under control.</p>\n<p>According to Geoff Green, a UCSB alumnus who served as Associated Students president during the 1993-94 academic year, his year in office marked a huge transition towards a significant increase in police and authoritative presence during Halloween. Green said that although the plan has good intentions and the safety measures were needed, students seemed unsure on how Halloween would play out.</p>\n<p>“For the most part, people were onboard with the principle, but concerned with implementation,” Green said, “especially since this was only a couple years after Rodney King and the L.A. Riots — people were suspicious of law enforcement and authority.”</p>\n<p>According to Green, following the increase of police in I.V. caused an increase in the level of resident complaints against police.</p>\n<p>“1993 marked a significant jump in the level of police enforcement in I.V. during Halloween, taking authoritative levels to an all-time high,” Green said. “With this massive influx of authoritative enforcement, Isla Vista felt like a police-occupied state for many I.V. residents and afterwards, there were dozens of complaints of poor treatment by authority and many cases of civil rights abuses by authority.”</p>\n<p>Green said students organized to counter the increased presence of law enforcement with an overwhelming amount of monitoring done by citizens. Green put cameras into the hands of student volunteers to monitor Halloween in general, but also to monitor the police force. This civilian tactic worked to balance the huge numbers of law enforcement officials and keep them on their best behavior, Green said.</p>\n<p>“Recording kept law enforcement on its best behavior and it went very well, it was very peaceful and it greatly reduced the number of complaints against police behavior and unjust arrests,” Green said. “It worked as a friendly reminder to authority that we’re watching out for our community — it wasn’t an anti-cop thing, it was a way to respond to the overwhelming authority presence through being our own watching presence in the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Senior Deputy Mark Ward, who has worked as an I.V. Foot Patrol officer for the past 15 years, the increasing numbers of enforcement officials is necessary to protect I.V. during Halloween each year.</p>\n<p>“Halloween seems to get bigger and bigger every year,” Ward said. “Consequently, with increasing numbers of visitors, the law enforcement presence also has to increase. There has to be more law enforcement available to protect the growing number of people.”</p>\n<p>Ward said he noticed that in the last few years there has been a change in attitude towards law enforcement officers, and it has been “generally more assaultive.”</p>\n<p>“Years ago, back when I started as an officer, if you saw a law enforcement officer fighting somebody you would stop what you’re doing and help the officer,” Ward said. “On the other hand, nowadays, in that same situation, everyone or witness now take out their devices to video what’s going on.”</p>\n<p>However, Green said that video recording is a part of officer-to-citizen accountability.</p>\n<p>“The advantage generally goes to law enforcement when there are stationary cameras set up and police are largely given the benefit of the doubt in cases,” Green said.</p>\n<p>According to Ward, there has been a “fundamental change” in behavioral issues in I.V. — particularly in how college-age students react to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“When I started as an officer in I.V. you could walk up to a person or group and ask ‘What’s going on?’ and they would answer and be respectful,” Ward said. “Now with a simple ‘How are you doing?’ instead of receiving an answer, the group or person in question starts videotaping and chooses to escalate the encounter into a fight and it’s a waste of time, it’s dangerous and it puts everyone at risk.”</p>\n<p>According to Green, the level of police presence in Isla Vista will “probably continue” as the norm until I.V. has more say in its own governance.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57682\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/history-of-halloween-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57682\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/history-of-halloween-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/history-of-halloween-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/history-of-halloween-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/history-of-halloween-in-i-v/","id":3631,"author":{"id":355,"name":"Kaitlin Cuskey"},"related":[3630,3629,3628],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"County Approves Fencing Project","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Santa Barbara County Planning Commission voted unanimously yesterday in support of fencing six public parks that line the bluffs of Isla Vista.

Still others have been badly injured in accidental falls, too many to count.”</p>\n<p>Goodman also said the efforts by Morrison and other student and local organizations to put up fencing in I.V. have been inspiring.<br>\n“Their work reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from Margaret Mead,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>“‘Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.’”</p>\n<p>According to Blough, the construction is vital to maintaining safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Overall, I think building these fences is great,” Blough said. “It doesn’t matter what the cost is, what is important is that these fences will save lives.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, October 30, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57645\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/county-approves-fencing-project/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57645\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/county-approves-fencing-project/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/county-approves-fencing-project/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/county-approves-fencing-project/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/county-approves-fencing-project/","id":3592,"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher"},"related":[3591,3590,3589],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blood Drive Draws Donators","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Alumni Association hosted a blood drive today that was open to faculty, students, staff and local residents at the Mosher Alumni House.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57689\" style=\"width: 563px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57689\" data-attachment-id=\"57689\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/blood-drive-draws-donators/header-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/header.jpg?fit=760%2C264&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"760,264\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1211401031\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.6\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"header\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/header.jpg?fit=250%2C87&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/header.jpg?fit=760%2C264&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57689\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/header.jpg?resize=553%2C234\" alt=\"The Mosher Alumni House played host to a blood drive put on by the Alumni Association earlier today.

Since its first blood drive in Oct. 2011, the Alumni Association has drawn over 638 participants to donate blood.</p>\n<p>Alumni Association spokesperson Rocio Torres said the drive is one of many events hosted at Mosher Alumni House geared toward bridging the campus with the community.</p>\n<p>“One of our goals at the Alumni Association is provide service opportunities for alumni and students,” Torres said.</p>\n<p>Third-year geohydrology major Kaitlyn Smith said she has donated blood over 10 times since she has been to college.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great way to help people,” Smith said, “because if I needed blood, I would like it to be available.”</p>\n<p>The United Blood Services Regional Donor Recruitment Director for the Santa Barbara area Scott Edward said the amount of discomfort individuals experience when donating blood is a minor cost in comparison to its potential benefits.</p>\n<p>“The process itself is very straightforward,” Edward said. “That moment of discomfort is so small that it’s easy to put it out of your mind.”</p>\n<p>According to Edward, the blood from the drive will be given to local hospitals, as Santa Barbara is not big enough to supply blood to other areas.</p>\n<p>“We have weekly demands so consistency is key to maintaining the blood supply,” Edward said. “During the winter holiday season and summertime, donations can easy decrease, so we launch special campaigns to raise awareness and encourage donations.”</p>\n<p>Donor recruiter and blood drive scheduler Maricela Carpinteyro said maintaining a sufficient supply is not easy.</p>\n<p>“With the needs of the hospitals, we usually need about 130 pints of blood everyday to meet the hospital’s needs,” Carpinteyro said. “It’s a challenge especially since not everybody could give to everybody.”</p>\n<p>According to Edward, students should spend the time to give blood because it can have far-reaching positive effects for others.</p>\n<p>“You can save a lot of lives,” Edward said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

As a student, your interests are at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats vice president of events and fourth-year geology major Sam Goldman said although the university’s position as the number one university for voter registration is commendable, the achievement can be misleading.</p>\n<p>“You want to make sure that voter registration turns into actual voting,” Goldman said. “It is obviously really awesome, and it does reflect a campus that is active and concerned with what’s going on around us. But hopefully the momentum from this event will get people excited and will carry over to election day.”<br>\nCapps said that students have a significant impact on the outcome of her race.</p>\n<p>“It’s a concentration of votes that I appreciate for my race because this race is really a tough one and so it might give me the margin of victory,” Capps said. “My husband won a congressional seat and he won by the margin of the number of students who voted in Isla Vista and at UCSB. I always try to share that with students about the importance of student votes.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, students play a large role in deciding whether or not future cyclic steam injection, acidizing or fracking will occur in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara is regarded in many places as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and that is an important legacy,” Williams said. “We had hundreds of applications in the last year [for drilling new wells] and many would be with the most dangerous, the most water intensive and the highest carbon emissions of techniques that are out there.”</p>\n<p>According to Campus Democrats President and fourth-year chemistry major Krishna Hammond, as election day grows closer Campus Democrats will continue to promote the importance of voting to students and Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>For the “I’ve got a big clock counting down in my head ‘til election day,” Hammond said. “We’re going to be knocking on doors, calling people, going around the neighborhood, waving signs at people; basically everything you possibly can to get people to come out.”</p>\n<p>Newsom said he believes Campus Democrats’ efforts are important to help “reconcile the apathy that exists with young folks in the electoral process at all levels.”</p>\n<p>“We have an obligation to be active citizens,” Newsom said. “Young folks have the capacity to amplify their voices in a way that is unique in this generation. There are a lot of young folks that have the absolute ability to change things radically, but only if they exercise their voice and are more participatory in the life of their campus.”</p>\n<p>A

and author Kati Marton held a talk at Corwin Pavilion on Wednesday regarding her book, <em>The Great Escape: Nine Jews Who Fled Hitler and Changed the World</em>.</p>\n<p>The Hungarian-born daughter of journalists who spent two years in prison for false charges of spying, and the granddaughter of Jews who were killed at Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust, Marton moved with her family to Maryland in 1956 following the Hungarian Revolution.</p>\n<p>Marton’s book follows the lives of nine influential figures, including physicists Leo Szilard, Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, who convinced Albert Einstein to warn then-President Franklin Roosevelt of Germany’s development of nuclear weapons and paved the way for the Manhattan Project, as well as many other reputable figures such as inventor John von Neumann,<em> Darkness at Noon</em> author Arthur Koestler, photographers Robert Capa and Andre Kertesz as well as filmmakers Alexander Korda and Michael Curtiz, who directed <em>Casablanca </em>and other well-known films.</p>\n<p>Marton said she chose the nine individuals because they all spent time in her birthplace of Budapest. According to Marton, she wanted to investigate the influence the ancient European capital had on each character and their intellect.</p>\n<p>“Nobody had created a group out of them, and that was what I tried to do, to discover what was in the espresso in Budapest that had created this fantastic explosion of talent,” Marton said.</p>\n<p>Marton said although the nine men were secular Jews, their lives also began to change with the mass persecution of Jewish people at the time.</p>\n<p>“[The nine] were very aware of the fact that their parents and grandparents had not been given these opportunities; that just a generation before, they had been stuck in muddy villages … with very limited scope for ambition,” Marton said. “So they were men in a hurry.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Lyiam Galo was one of the Instructional Development students who filmed the event for UCTV, and said Marton’s talk effectively handled unsettling topics while making them accessible to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>“[Marton] was super receptive to questions,” Galo said. “The subject matter was dark, but she managed to incorporate humor.”</p>\n<p>This event was the first of nine that will be hosted this year by the Taubman Symposia in Jewish Studies at UCSB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57701\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57701\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/","id":2991,"author":{"id":180,"name":"Jason Chun"},"related":[2990,2989,2988],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate meeting included debate on a bill that would change the responsibilities of the Student Advocate General, a visit from UCPD’s Lt. Mark Signa and a speaker on the place of art in Isla Vista. <em>Alex Yam/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night in the Flying A room in the UCen to discuss issues including the proposed “Bill to Re-Envision the Office of the Student Advocate General” and heard questions regarding police policies for this upcoming Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>The proposed “Bill to Re-Envision the Office of the Student Advocate General” seeks to create a new advocacy unit to deal with individual students’ needs, a service the SAG currently performs. UCSB Police Department Lt. Mark Signa also answered questions from senators about police policies in I.V. this Halloween, including restrictions on vehicle traffic.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year sociology and psychology double major and A.S. President Ali Guthy, the bill would remove the casework aspects of the work done by SAG.</p>\n<p>“The bill is a structural change,” Guthy said. “It has no effect on the SAG’s ability to select their staff, it just removes their casework component.”</p>\n<p>Guthy defended the proposal and cited the A.S. Legal Code as a reason for separating the casework and outreach responsibilities of the SAG.</p>\n<p>“The constitution does not demand that the SAG perform casework,” Guthy said. “They’re supposed to educate the student body on these resources, and then they’re also doing casework, which is not listed in the constitution.”</p>\n<p>Former Student Advocate General and third-year CCS literature major Bailey Loverin, who was elected last Spring and abdicated the position in early September, said that SAG workers’ viewpoints should be considered and discussed as well as the possible issues with forming a new advocacy unit. Loverin said those present lacked any experience in the position of SAG and raised concerns about maintaining confidentiality in the proposed new unit.</p>\n<p>“I think it is ridiculous that this is even being considered,” Loverin said. “Did you know that anyone entering that office [as SAG] has to sign a non-disclosure agreement worth half a million dollars to maintain confidentiality? That becomes a huge risk when you have a unit doing this. How are you going to maintain confidentiality?”</p>\n<p>The bill will be discussed further in future meetings and a senate vote has not yet been held.</p>\n<p>Signa was present at the senate meeting as a representative of the UCPD and discussed police policies for the upcoming Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>A.S. Off-Campus Senator Michelle Moreh asked whether or not identification would be required to enter I.V. this weekend.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen a sign near campus saying you may need to provide proof of residency to be able to come into Isla Vista during a certain time period…” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>Signa said no such policies would be in place this weekend. According to Signa, the only areas facing restrictions on vehicle traffic will be the 6500, 6700 and 6800 blocks of Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road.</p>\n<p>Signa also said the police strategy to maintain peace this weekend includes an effort to keep crowds moving to prevent tensions from rising and fights from breaking out.</p>\n<p>“The goal is not to go out there and write a lot of tickets. The goal is to keep the streets going and moving back and forth,” Signa said. “When the crowd stops there’s a serious concern there that the crowd will bunch up and when people get really crowded in there, they’ve been tense, they’ve been intoxicated, they get aggressive and fights start breaking out. That’s the same reason we don’t want cars on Del Playa.”</p>\n<p>According to Signa, he enjoys working in the community, although certain segments make his job more difficult.</p>\n<p>“I love working here, I love Isla Vista, I love the community, I love the university,” Signa said. “The struggle with Isla Vista is you have such a diverse population and I don’t want to point fingers at any group but City College unfortunately has a reputation of having a lot of kids there for partying. If that’s their only goal, it’s hard to change that.”</p>\n<p>Professor Kim Yasuda from the art dept. also spoke briefly to the senate about recent public art demonstrations in I.V. and the importance of developing I.V. as an artistic community.</p>\n<p>“I really feel like Isla Vista is ripe for a creative incubator where students could engage in projects,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>Yasuda said I.V. could be made safer not only by increasing security, but also increasing public art. As an example, Yasuda broached the possibility of public lighting in the form of art installations.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I want to say is enforcement is certainly important for safety, but there’s also engagement, and I think the arts could bring the engagement piece in partnership with the enforcement piece to bring a really safe environment,” Yasuda said. “Public lighting doesn’t have to be security lights or surveillance cameras; It can be beautiful, magical lighting.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Off-Campus Senator Xin Ma was also sworn in at the meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>The two candidates for Student Advocate General, third-year environmental studies major Sukayna Ibrahim and second-year College of Creative Studies literature major Ethan Reul, discussed their respective agendas for this year’s special election on Tuesday at a public forum at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The Student Advocate General is an Associated Students executive officer and acts as a public defender for the students under university policy. The special election comes after third-year CCS literature major Bailey Loverin, who was elected to the SAG position last Spring, abdicated the position because of personal medical issues.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim and Reul addressed issues such as student outreach and the efficiency and productivity of the SAG office.  When asked about the role of the SAG, the candidates stressed different parts of the job, with Ibrahim emphasizing the role of assistance that SAG provides for students.</p>\n<p>“The job of the Student Advocate General is to facilitate communication between the students and the university,” Ibrahim said. “If a student is in trouble for cheating or dealing with harassment, our job is to advise them on what to do. The student advocacy general should be a resource that is always available for students to advise them on whatever issue that they may be having,” Ibrahim said.</p>\n<p>Reul said the SAG should serve as a direct link between students and the university, advocating for students to university administration.</p>\n<p>“We are the only office in the executive that directly deals with the students,” Reul said. “The role of the Student Advocate General is to not only amplify the voice of the students, but also to give them resources to assist themselves.”</p>\n<p>When asked about informing students regarding the Office of the Student Advocate, both candidates agreed on hosting more events to educate students about the office.</p>\n<p>Reul said he plans on continuing the outreach program that Loverin began last year in addition to the casework department.</p>\n<p>“We are going to hire more casework staff to enhance the outreach output,” Reul said. “We are going to host regular events in I.V. and in residence halls to tell people about SAG.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said he also supported the outreach program and discussed other ways to reach out to students.</p>\n<p>“I will let students know that this resource is available to them,” Ibrahim said. “I will definitely utilize Facebook as a platform to get the word out.”</p>\n<p>Both candidates said events in Isla Vista, such as Deltopia and Halloween, have gotten out of hand. Both candidates also discussed the role of on-campus events to deter students from going to I.V., but each are looking for different ways to do so.</p>\n<p>“With everything that has happened last year, these events have become really unsafe,” Ibrahim said. “Whether it is from the presence of people from out of town or the increased police presence that has made people feel uncomfortable. We really need to focus on keeping it local and safe.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said she supported events such as the upcoming concert on Friday, because of their potential to reduce student participation in the Halloween festivities.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Residence Hall Association, Reul emphasized the role that RHA can play during these events.</p>\n<p>“I feel that these events have gotten unwieldy,” Reul said. “We can provide alternatives to these events. RHA does hold events that are not only for the residence hall members but also for the community at large. We can make these events fun and also safe.”</p>\n<p>However, the candidates disagreed on how they would increase the efficiency of the SAG.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said measures should be put in place to ensure a more productive working environment.</p>\n<p>“There should be a reapplication process to make sure there is a really good work dynamic,” Ibrahim said. “I honestly feel that a good work dynamic can help increase efficiency. Also, assigning very specific duties to the staff because all of the duties are broad.”</p>\n<p>Reul also said he will seek to increase productivity by allowing students new ways to submit their cases.</p>\n<p>“We intend to increase efficiency by reinventing our website to make sure that cases can be submitted online with near-instant response,” Reul said. “We are going to have office hours in residence halls.”</p>\n<p>In their closing statements, Reul reiterated his experience in the OSA, while Ibrahim emphasized her association with numerous organizations on campus.</p><div

Illegal plants were found in 18 different locations, primarily in national parks such as the Los Padres National Forest. Sheriffs</p>\n<p>also located campsites nearby the grow sites, however, no arrests were made during the eradication.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s spokesperson Kelly Hoover, this year’s raids yielded slightly less plants than last year but was “still a success.”</p>\n<p>“We had great collaboration with aviation, narcotic detectives and our partnering programs,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Hoover also said the Sherriff’s Office attributes reduction in eradication yield from California’s continuing water shortage.</p>\n<p>“The amount we eradicated this year was lower than previous seasons and probably due to the effects of the drought,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>First-year financial mathematics major Crystal Luo said the results are notable, but said she believes the numbers were not representative of all illegal marijuana sales.</p>\n<p>“[The results] are still miniscule in comparison to the underground marijuana industry as a whole. 47,000 plants is nothing when there are millions more and when each plant can even be harvested more than once,” Luo said. “I was not even aware that this eradication happened which shows how insignificant it was to me.”</p>\n<p>Luo said she does not believe the eradication’s results are worth the consequent campaign expenses.</p>\n<p>“The marijuana industry is too big to be affected by these small time eradications,” Luo said. “[You] might as well make marijuana legal to tax it and make billions.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history and statistics major Steven Tragarz said he does not see a lasting impression from this eradication process.</p>\n<p>“I do not believe the costs that went into the bust was worth it; they poured millions of dollars into a short-term, stop gap solution, which effects will soon be reversed,” Tragarz said. “In short, the cops may have won the battle, but they are still losing the war.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_57527\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"621833262\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57522\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57527\" data-attachment-id=\"57527\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/sheriffs-department-destroys-marijuana-plants/unnamed1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?fit=1001%2C751&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1001,751\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57527\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?resize=650%2C488\" alt=\"unnamed1\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?w=1001&amp;ssl=1 1001w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illegal growers may camp in National Forest land for extended periods of time, leading to large piles of garbage, human waste and the dumping of unregulated pesticides.<em> Photo courtesy of Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yang said the university takes pride in Nakamura’s technological innovation and the consequent positive impact he has had on the world.</p>\n<p>“The Order of Culture award is a significant acknowledgement that Professor Nakamura’s invention of the first bright blue light-emitting diode will continue to be recognized the world over for its long-lasting and far-reaching impacts on our global society,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, in addition to Nakamura’s “unparalleled breakthroughs” in physics, materials science and technology, his invention of the LED has led to affordable energy access for citizens across the globe.</p>\n<p>“By making white LED lighting a reality, he has opened the door to affordable, energy-efficient lighting for every person in every nation– a monumental contribution to all of humankind,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Watch the <em>Daily Nexus</em>‘ interview with Professor Nakamura <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-14/nobel-prize-winner-and-ucsb-professor-shuji-nakamura-interview/\">here.</a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57470\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57470\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/","id":2988,"author":{"id":178,"name":"Jackson Kerr"},"related":[2987,2986,2985],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Judicial Council Rules In Favor of I.V.

On Wednesday, the UMC’s Judicial Council — the church’s highest court — held a hearing in Memphis, Tennessee, to determine whether or not a lower appeals court acted properly in restoring Schaefer his reverendship status in June of this year. The prosecuting clergy member in Schaefer’s case, the Rev. Christopher Fisher of the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, brought an appeal to the Council in July, stating, among other reasons, that the lower appeals court “wrongly crafted” its own penalty rather than “remanding” it back to the trial court to determine the penalty.</p>\n<p>The Judicial Council’s final decision was announced on its website yesterday morning and states that the church’s Jurisdictional Committee on Appeals operated accordingly in its decision to reverse the lower court’s penalty on Schaefer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The Judicial Council … finds there are no errors in the application of the church law and judicial decisions,” the UMC press release stated. “The penalty as modified by the Committee on Appeals stands.”</p>\n<p>Schaefer said he is grateful to keep his status as a reverend.</p>\n<p>“I feel relieved.

Carcaño of the Los Angeles Episcopal Area said she was pleased with the final decision made by the UMC Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“I rejoice in the decision of the Judicial Council in the case of Rev. Frank Schaefer,” said Carcaño. “I believe it affirms our United Methodist commitment to doing all the good we can in the name of Jesus our Lord.”</p>\n<p>Carcaño said she believes the ruling opens the door for Schaefer to further his ministry in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Already Rev. Schaefer’s ministry is bearing much good fruit in Southern California,” said Carcano. “The Judicial Council decision now frees him to continue the work of making disciples of Jesus for the transformation of the world.”</p>\n<p>According to Schaefer, the ruling will allow him focus more on his ministry at University United Methodist Church.</p>\n<p>“Now I will have the opportunity to really devote myself to Isla Vista,” Schaefer said. “I have such a big heart for Isla Vista, and I really want to help to create healthy, good structures and good community.”</p>\n<p>The LGBTQ-friendly pastor said he has a message to individuals who feel that the council made the wrong decision.</p>\n<p>“Deal with it,” Schaefer said.</p>\n<p>Prosecutor Rev. Christopher Fisher was not available for comment.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57468\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/judicial-council-rules-in-favor-of-i-v-pastor/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57468\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/judicial-council-rules-in-favor-of-i-v-pastor/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/judicial-council-rules-in-favor-of-i-v-pastor/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/judicial-council-rules-in-favor-of-i-v-pastor/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/judicial-council-rules-in-favor-of-i-v-pastor/","id":3629,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3628,3627,3626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"La Escuelita Treats Isla Vistans to a Safe Halloween","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District and campus-based nonprofit La Escuelita hosted Safe Halloween this past Saturday, a free event for the children in I.V. held at the Children’s Park on Pic...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57422\" style=\"width: 579px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WelcomeToIslaVista.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"568607159\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57397\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57422\" data-attachment-id=\"57422\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/welcometoislavista/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WelcomeToIslaVista.png?fit=1800%2C1383&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1800,1383\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WelcomeToIslaVista\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WelcomeToIslaVista.png?fit=250%2C192&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WelcomeToIslaVista.png?fit=888%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57422\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WelcomeToIslaVista-1024x786.png?resize=569%2C437\" alt=\"WelcomeToIslaVista\" width=\"569\" height=\"437\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57422\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Safe Halloween is a free event hosted annually that provides games, activities and prizes for children in Isla Vista.<br><em>Photo courtesy of wikimedia.org</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District and campus-based nonprofit La Escuelita hosted Safe Halloween this past Saturday, a free event for the children in I.V. held at the Children’s Park on Picasso Rd.</p>\n<p>The event included activities organized by various members of Greek life and booths decorated with festive items such as pumpkins, bats, ghosts, witches, confetti, paint, spider webs and candy. Activities at the event included a football toss, toilet paper toss, potato sack races, ring toss, fish pong, face painting, mini-golf and soccer bowling.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Recreation Coordinator Annie Aziz said the help of on-campus organizations made setting up this year’s event much easier than years past.</p>\n<p>“In the past, it was a lot harder because it was just I.V. Parks and Rec,” Aziz said. “I have much more support nowadays and it makes the event more successful and efficient. The on-campus organizations know how to organize, prepare and carry on events like this.”</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and third-year mechanical engineering major Lucia Arias said working Safe Halloween is a gratifying experience that causes participating children to “light up with joy.”</p>\n<p>“Many UCSB orgs participate and it is a heartwarming experience,” Arias said. “The kids appreciate it because it’s for them and they feel special since it’s a day catered to their fun for this holiday. They mostly appreciate how college students are around because they look up to us.”</p>\n<p>Lucia also said she hopes students keep other residents of I.V. — such as children — in mind when deciding how to handle this coming Halloween.</p>\n<p>“We as students do not really appreciate the space that we have in I.V.,” Arias said. “We can openly show families and residents that we are not here just to party. We want to acknowledge them through events like this.”</p>\n<p>Andrea Angulo, co-chair of La Escuelita and third-year Spanish and sociology major said Safe Halloween exemplifies a way in which students and other I.V. residents can come together in a safe, healthy and festive setting.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Safe Halloween that provides unity between UCSB, families and the children of Isla Vista to provide a safe space to Isla Vista,” Angulo said.</p>\n<p>Angulo also said children in I.V. do not get the chance to fully enjoy Halloween in their neighborhood because students are participating in “nightly parties inside of [their] community.”</p>\n<p>“From a kid’s perspective, it’s unfortunate to leave their community during Halloween day to have a good time. Isla Vista is simply not a safe place for children during this time period, especially during nighttime,” Angulo said. “I personally would not enjoy it if I were a kid and had to go trick-or-treating at a foreign neighborhood.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-grade student at Isla Vista Elementary School David Zamora said he has been coming to the event for the last few years and now recognizes some of the college students working at the booths.</p>\n<p>“I have been to this event since I was in third grade. I like the booths, the candy and the Halloween music they play,” Zamora said. “My friends come and I see familiar college students that I admire.”</p>\n<p>A mother of four, Isla Vista resident Janice Garcia said the presence of students throughout the day makes her feel better about the event.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a beautiful event because kids come during the day and there are fun games and candy. The fact that university students and parents are present during the day assures me that everything will be fine,” Garcia said. “I have lived in Isla Vista for 14 years and Halloween night can get ugly and sketchy. This is why I do not allow my children to be out during this time.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and Sigma Chi Omega president Jason Ouyang said Safe Halloween promotes consideration for children and other I.V. community members and that students should take heed of the event’s efforts.</p>\n<p>“It’s unfair that kids can’t have a safe time during Halloween, and it might be selfish on part of college students since we are having constant parties and drinking which is not good,” Ouyang said. “I appreciate everything that these orgs are doing. I don’t know how they organize it, but they do it well. Each booth is decorative and I support this event.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

we encourage people to be active outdoors and enjoy our beautiful weather and to commune, work together as a community, meet new people, slow down the pace of life a little bit.”</p>\n<p>La Riva also said that besides South America, Los Angeles has also been doing their own version of <em>ciclovias</em>, where the streets are closed down and remain open for just bikes and people.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got it put together. Once you have one, then you know how to better do it next time,” La Riva said. “It started in other places and so Santa Barbara’s trying to take it on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/","id":3460,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[3459,3458,3457],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sick as a Dog: Parvovirus on the Rise in Santa Maria","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Santa Barbara County Animal Services has reported a high number of cases of parvovirus in dogs in the Santa Maria area, with five confirmed cases in the last few weeks.

\r\n</script> \n<p>According to Courtney Hazard, a technician at Valley Animal Hospital in Goleta, parvovirus has been a problem for a long time because of its level of contagiousness.</p>\n<p>“Dogs can basically sniff the ground where another dog walked or peed and become infected,” Hazard said. “It can hit pretty hard and fast, and if they aren’t treated it can become fatal very quickly.”</p>\n<p>Hazard said treatment for parvovirus can be pretty tedious as the dogs have to combat both the viral and bacterial component.</p>\n<p>“They have to be quarantined, have an I.V. catheter placed, be put on fluids and given injectable antibiotics instead of oral medicine so their liver doesn’t have to process anything,” Hazard said. “Their body has to fight off the viral side because we don’t have a treatment for that unfortunately.”</p>\n<p>Santa Maria Animal Care Foundation volunteer coordinator Stacy Silva said the organization’s greatest concern has been regarding owners of confirmed infected puppies refusing treatment and taking the sick dogs home from veterinary offices.</p>\n<p>“Right now we are seeing this in the Santa Maria area with several cases in the last few weeks, which is a pretty high number,” Silva said.</p>\n<p>According to Silva, signs of the parvovirus show up within 10 to 14 days, depending on the level of exposure the dog has had.</p>\n<p>“The virus spreads very rapidly through contact with surfaces of an infected dog or even the infected dog itself,” Silva said. “The virus itself can be killed with a bleach and water solution, however, it can live in porous surfaces for up to two years in the right condition.”</p>\n<p>Hazard said the most important step in avoiding the parvovirus is to fully vaccinate dogs, a process that takes 16 weeks to complete.</p>\n<p>“We tell owners all the time to not take your unvaccinated puppy to the dog park, the beach or sniff anything too much and to keep them on the cement if you have to take them for a walk.” Hazard said. “Keep your dog as close to your home as you can and don’t let them be in contact with any other dog until they’re fully vaccinated.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biology and English double-major Andy Hashimoto, who worked at an animal clinic in Monterey, CA, said once a dog is infected it is difficult to get rid of the virus.</p>\n<p>“There was a parvo-puppy at the clinic I worked at and he was quarantined so no one was allowed in there unless they wore a big white suit,” Hashimoto said. “It was really sad because we had to wear gloves if we wanted to feed him or pet him.”</p>\n<p>According to Hashimoto, it’s easy to protect a dog from the virus if they are given the vaccinations they need when they are puppies.</p>\n<p>“The parvo vaccine is usually included in the first vaccine pack you have to get for your puppy, so just make sure you get that because it’s very important before they’re too old,” Hashimoto said. “It’s a really easy thing to do and it could save a dog’s life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Will Tran/<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>Career Services held the first day of its Fall Career Fair yesterday at Corwin Pavilion, with a second day open only to science, technology and engineering students, open today.</p>\n<p>The fair, which happens every quarter, features a slew of national companies such as Yelp, Target, Microsoft, SolarCity and Oracle, along with local companies such as Raytheon and AppFolio. Although the event is free for all students, alumni are welcome with a nominal fee paid two days in advance.</p>\n<p>According to Career Services counselor Molly Steen, the fair usually attracts a turnout of about 600 to 800 students.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good number of students that come through and take advantage of this,” Steen said.</p>\n<p>Annie Phung, a fourth-year communication major and member of business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi, one of the fair sponsors, said her organization has been busy trying to promote the event by passing out flyers, posters and making announcements. She said the fair is a good opportunity not only to come into contact with potential employers, but to gain employment-seeking skills.</p>\n<p>“You just come and talk to people,” Phung said. “It is also good practice for them to look professional; to communicate on a casual, yet professional level with employers face-to-face.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Feria, a fourth-year sociology and Spanish double major and member of Teach for America, said she is excited be on the other side of job hunt, helping students get career experience.</p>\n<p>“There is so much potential in all these students, and the fact that I was on the other side last year and I’m helping them now is so amazing,” Feria said. “You can tell the difference between somebody who takes the initiative to bring a resume, somebody who takes the initiative to have everything clean and somebody who takes the initiative to really stand out is really great.”</p>\n<p>Alumna Kristie Reynolds, who represented Macy’s, said there are certain steps students can do to improve their chances of landing a job.</p>\n<p>“Be prepared,” Reynolds said. “Definitely look up all the companies that are going to be at the career fair that you’re interested in. I think you need to know what positions that they have available … and know what you want to go into and be prepared with the experience that you have and how to sell yourself at the career fair.”</p>\n<p>Electrical engineering major Daren Jing said he focused on writing a good resume to get an internship for electrical or computer engineering. He said the career fair makes the job search easily accessible for all students.</p>\n<p>“This [is] good because I can talk to those people, those employees and learn more about their company,” Jing said. “I don’t need to go online and search [for] each company. It takes a lot of time, but here, I can talk to each [person] and hand out my resume.”</p>\n<p>Reynolds said students will learn about the career options they’ll have during and after college.</p>\n<p>“I hope that they’ll get good experience in learning how to network and find out what’s out there for them and how UCSB can really help them develop their careers after college,” she said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 14 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57286\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57286\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/","id":2986,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[2985,2984,2983],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

In June of this year, he was able to win back his pastor status when he appealed to a committee, followed by being appointed as pastor to the University United Methodist Church in Isla Vista in July.</p>\n<p>According to John Coleman, director of communications for the United Methodist Church’s Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, Schaefer’s initial prosecutor, Reverend Christopher Fisher, brought the appeal to the Judicial Council, the UMC’s highest court, earlier this year for review.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

We don’t see it having an impact on the separate issue of equal access to civil marriage in the United States.”</p>\n<p>University United Methodist Church musician Ethan Bertrand said he is ultimately optimistic.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important that we’re moving in this direction,” Bertrand said. “The church needs to be more open, and this is a great place to start.”</p>\n<p>Prosecutor Reverend Christopher Fisher declined to comment last night on the hearing.</p>\n<p>If Schaefer is defrocked, he said he would still serve at the United Methodist Church in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The day after I got defrocked, Bishop [Minerva] Carcano told me, ‘We believe you here in California,’” Schaefer said. “Even if I get defrocked again, she promised to keep me in the church.”</p>\n<p>This “promise” would be upheld in one of two ways, he said.</p>\n<p>“I will either change my status to church administrator or seek reordination through the California conference,” Schaefer said.</p>\n<p>According to the United Methodist Church Judicial Council’s website, a decision is not expected to be announced until several days after the full meeting concludes on Oct. 25.</p>\n<p>Most people, according to Coleman, are hoping for a ruling that is universally fair.</p>\n<p>“The most desirable outcome is a just resolution,” Coleman said. “We need a compromise that achieves justice for both sides.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Schaefer had appealed the ruling. This is not correct. Schaefer had his ruling appealed by another party.]</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57253\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57253\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/","id":3458,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3457,3456,3455],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":136,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
