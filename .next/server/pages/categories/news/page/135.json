Whereas once we have solar, we know there’s a payback time and then it’s energy that we’re not really paying for anymore.”</p>\n<p>Riley said the use of solar panels is more environmentally friendly and that the continued reliance on non-renewable energy is not justified.</p>\n<p>“It’s just so much cleaner,” Riley said. “There’s no real reason to keep using fossil fuels if we don’t have to, and we think we don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>According to LEED program manager Jordan Sager, their office handles the design of systems and the campus energy bills and works with Southern California Edison to obtain permits for projects such as the one on Lot 22. Sager also said a motivating factor behind the construction of the solar panel system has been UC President Janet Napolitano’s Carbon Neutrality Initiative.</p>\n<p>“A little less than a year ago, when Janet Napolitano took her role as President of the UC, she announced an initiative that all the UC campuses would be carbon neutral by 2025,” Sager said. “So we’re kind of working towards working out what that means for our campus, and how we’re going to get there.”</p>\n<p>Senior Project Manager of the Design and Construction Services George Levinthal said the design of the system had to be reevaluated several times due to unforeseen issues with the module type and the structure of the system. The module type that was initially selected experienced a radical increase in demand, making it impossible to purchase without going way over budget.</p>\n<p>Levinthal said the original structure plan had to be redesigned to better accommodate the solar panels.</p>\n<p>“There were structural issues, so we went back and determined that the truss system that we have now would work much better structurally for its effect on the building,” Levinthal said. “So we went back and it was redesigned using a truss system to support the panels, and by doing that we ended up with fewer panels and less kW generating capacity than we had originally had in the first design.”</p>\n<p>According to Levinthal, Lot 22 is an ideal location for a solar energy system because the parking structure had been built with future plans for solar energy in mind. The concrete columns were strengthened to support the panels, and electrical conduits were run from the basement to the roof as preparation for the prospect of putting solar panels in.</p>\n<p>Riley also said student support for the Renewable Energy Initiative referendum, which has charged students $6 in their fees since fall 2010 and will continue to do so until 2020, is largely responsible for the solar panel installation.</p>\n<p>“Students thought it was worthwhile, very worthwhile, and voted for it. So that’s where the money’s coming from,” Riley said. “And it’s being augmented with other funds from the Student Resource Building Governance Board and the Student Fee Advisory Committee.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, November 6, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Mitchner’s discussion primarily touched on the relationship between digital and traditional print publishing.</p>\n<p>According to Mitchner, the progression of modern technology is not a threat to the publishing industry, but rather poses “an opportunity and a challenge.”</p>\n<p>“We just have to figure out how to use those resources better,” Mitchner said. “Revenue is declining, but the industry will persevere one way or another. I think that the future will continue for university presses and commercial presses.”</p>\n<p>Film and media studies caps associate professor and coordinator of the event Jennifer Holt said she hopes faculty and graduate students in attendance gained a wider perspective on the effects of digital publishing from Mitchner’s lecture.</p>\n<p>“I think it was an opportunity for these students to get a better perspective on what it means to be an author or to be in the literary business, from any perspective,” Holt said, “as a publisher, as an editor, as an author or even as a reader in this kind of time.”</p>\n<p>Assistant professor of sociology Zakiya Luna said that Mitchner’s advice gave her a better understanding of the digitization of the publishing industry.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important to think about these new forms of digital media and how to engage them,” Luna said. “It’s important to make sure that the different work we are publishing in different fields can potentially have a broader impact, keeping in mind the realities of what’s changed about academic publishing as we are writing our own work.”</p>\n<p>According to Luna, the lecture helped explain how the industry’s transition from print to online will affect current and future writers.</p>\n<p>“As publishing changes by the minute, it’s also really important that we as authors and scholars have the latest information,” Luna said. “It’s really exciting that the campus has supported an event like this and hopefully this will continue conversations about what is happening with publishing and how we can make sure that our work is speaking to those changing needs.”</p>\n<p>History department chair and professor Elizabeth Digeser hopes that the discussion with Mitchner will provide insight for current and interested publishers on how to adapt to the changes of the evolving publishing industry.</p>\n<p>“I have published in traditional formats — book and articles — but I know that there have been important changes in how research is communicated,” Digeser said. “I’d like to know more about what the current trends are so that I can take advantage of the new opportunities and can advise my graduate students as I do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth year graduate student in the Dept. of Film and Media Studies Rachel Fabian said she thought the discussion was very informative for graduate students looking to publish, such as herself.</p>\n<p>“As grad students on such a large campus, it’s often times difficult to get events catered for humanities scholars who are looking to publish,” Fabian said, “so it was very nice to have someone from Rutgers University Press who deals specifically with humanities subfields to talk to us about those very unique things that sometimes we don’t get a chance to talk about that much.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

courtesy of Disney</em></p></div>\n<p>“Guardians of the Galaxy” film editor Fred Raskin spoke during a Q&amp;A session yesterday in the Pollock Theater as a part of a three week series by the Carsey-Wolf Center called “Focus On: The Editor.”</p>\n<p>Film and Media Studies professor Joshua Moss, who is also Raskin’s friend, interviewed the film editor about his work, which includes “Boogie Nights,” “All the Pretty Horses” and<em> “</em>Kill Bill 1 and<em> </em>2<em>.”</em> Raskin also transitioned into editing for Justin<em> </em>Lin on<em> “</em>Better Luck Tomorrow,” “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,” “Fast  Five,” “Django Unchained” and “Guardians of the Galaxy<em>.” </em>His next project will be Quentin Tarantino’s next film “The Hateful Eight,” a film about bounty hunters in post-Civil War Wyoming.</p>\n<p>Raskin said he began working on films right after graduating from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and worked with James Gunn on one of his first jobs, a 1997 comedy called “Tromeo &amp; Juliet.” Raskin said he and Gunn had kept in touch since their work on that project, and that it was he who invited him to work on “Guardians of the Galaxy.”</p>\n<p>According to Raskin, he was more involved with “Guardians of the Galaxy” than any other movie he has worked on in the past, mostly because meeting with the Marvel executives about the project took an extensive amount of time. According to Raskin, meetings would take about three hours every day.</p>\n<p>“We would all sit in a room and we would talk about everything from how we are going to tackle one particular scene that might be problematic, to how we were going to restructure the first third of the movie for what we’re going to shoot when it comes to the additional photography phase of the movie,” Raskin said.</p>\n<p>Raskin said a particularly difficult aspect of his work on the film involved the challenges posed by fleshing out the character of Ronan, the film’s villain.</p>\n<p>“Probably the biggest problem the story had was the villain storyline,” Raskin said. “That Ronan’s motives weren’t entirely clear and he just wasn’t so well-developed so a lot of the recent material was there to make his goals more focused.”</p>\n<p>According to Moss, the strong point of “Guardians of the Galaxy” is the way the characters interact with one another while dealing with the orb, as the character interaction among “these five misfits” succeeds in conveying each character arc.</p>\n<p>“When I first saw it, what was interesting to me was the slapstick comedy bit where they’re all grabbing the orb early on in the film,” Moss said. “Is important because it sets up the idea that the orb gets to be something everybody else wants. The orb is the way we get to see characters but it’s not what the movie is really about.”</p>\n<p>Raskin said another challenging aspect of “Guardians of the Galaxy” was working with the comedic elements of the film.</p>\n<p>“In terms of comedy, we determined what jokes worked and what jokes didn’t and that’s the kind of thing that you feel when you watch the movie with an audience,” Raskin said.</p>\n<p>According to film and media studies undergraduate advisor Joe Palladino, the “Focus On: The Editor” series includes people with various positions in the film industry.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a ‘Focus on: Directors,’ we had a ‘Focus on: Music Videos,’ we had a ‘Focus on: Sound,’ so we wanted to do a ‘Focus on Editing,’” Palladino said. “We do a lot of screen writing stuff, the script to screen stuff, so we wanted to look at different people who maybe understand. They appreciate and try to bring someone in and give that person a little bit of a spotlight.”</p>\n<p>Palladino said the goal with Raskin’s presentation was to highlight the importance of the work of editors and other positions in the industry do that typically do not receive as much attention from audiences.</p>\n<p>“The editors are often people that are ignored and so we are looking at editors now for the series,” Palladino said. “There are a lot of students who say ‘I want to be a director,’ but there are so many other creative things, so we start presenting them with other creative fields. The idea of the Pollock programming is to give everyone a wide spectrum of film.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58031\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58031\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/","id":2962,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2961,2960,2959],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Finance Committee Drops S.C.O.R.E Funding Freeze","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last night, the Associated Students Senate met in the UCen’s Flying A room to discuss a variety of issues and receive input from several community members.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58000\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58000\" data-attachment-id=\"58000\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/finance-board-seeks-to-freeze-s-c-o-r-e-s-fund/as-senate-subject-is-alex-santos-by-kenneth-song_for-11-05-2014-5887/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?fit=1200%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,714\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415227044\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate (subject is Alex Santos-) by Kenneth Song_for 11.05.2014-5887\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?fit=250%2C149&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?fit=888%2C528&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?resize=500%2C298\" alt=\"Senators discussed the issue of ratifying the Finance Board’s request to freeze S.C.O.R.E.’s funds.

If approved, all student delegates selected for the Student of Color Conference this weekend will not be allowed to attend. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Last night, the Associated Students Senate met in the UCen’s Flying A room to discuss a variety of issues and receive input from several community members.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of this week’s meeting was the potential freezing of the Student Commission on Racial Equality’s (S.C.O.R.E.) funds. The A.S. Finance and Business Committee has recommended that the Senate freeze S.C.O.R.E.’s assets “based on allegations that SCORE violated student government bylaws through their Student of Color Conference (SOCC) delegate selection process,” according to a statement released on S.C.O.R.E.’s Facebook page yesterday.</p>\n<p>No members of S.C.O.R.E. were present at last night’s meeting.</p>\n<p>During public forum, Senator Nikka Kurland spoke for A.S. President Ali Guthy saying the president opposed the freeze. Chief Financial Officer of the A.S. Finance and Business Committee Andre Theus requested the Senate not ratify the freeze approved by the committee on Monday.</p>\n<p>“I am recommending that you not ratify the freeze,” Theus said. “Just to explain why I thought the freeze should happen is just that there was a lot of discrepancies happening … I think that’s the best resolution to this issue.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nikka Kurland proposed a resolution to increase “financial transparency” in response to Senate confusion about S.C.O.R.E.’s funding process.</p>\n<p>“They seemed very confused on how their funding works,” Kurland said. “So all this resolution does is it stipulates that S.C.O.R.E. must present all of their financial actions to the finance and business committee and to be approved directly by the finance and business committee just for the remainder of the quarter.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Controller Amir Khazaieli spoke in favor of freezing S.C.O.R.E.’s funding based on the organization’s lack of disclosure about Student of Color Conference (SOCC) funding, a UC Student Association gathering to take place this weekend at UC Merced.</p>\n<p>“According to policies and procedures, everything that [Finance and Business Committee] funds has to be open to all students in some way, shape or form. Nothing is, as of now, transparent in regards to this issue,” Khazaieli said. “Students have no say in who’s running [S.C.O.R.E.], how much money is spent on SOCC, what the sources of funding are for SOCC and how members of the SOCC delegation are chosen.”</p>\n<p>As A.S. Controller, it is Khazaieli’s job to make sure student fees are being allocated properly and in accordance with A.S. bylaws. Khazaieli said S.C.O.R.E.’s leaders are currently spending student money improperly.</p>\n<p>“I have an inconclusive set of data at my disposal to figure out whether or not student fees are being spent properly,” Khazaieli said. “I have to deem [the data] an inconsistent use of student fees.”</p>\n<p>In its press release, S.C.O.R.E. maintains that its current process for selecting students to SOCC is fair and compliant with A.S. regulations.</p>\n<p>“SCORE stands by its selection processes and deeply condemns [Finance and Business Committee] for attempting to freeze all of SCORE’s funding, which is used to support organizations and events that promote issues of diversity and inclusion of students of color at UC Santa Barbara,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>Senator and A.S. Finance and Business Committee member Jimmy Villarreal spoke to the Senate to summarize the committee’s thought process behind the freeze recommendation.</p>\n<p>“When we asked the representatives from S.C.O.R.E. questions they weren’t always 100 percent able to answer them. I want you to know I do not think they misused funds on purpose at all,” Villarreal said. “Because the [Finance and Business Committee] wasn’t really able to decide one way or the other [whether or not funds were being misused], we recommended a freeze. There is an issue of communication between S.C.O.R.E. and the rest of the Association.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nadia Blant said the proposal was pointless to approve, and would only waste time.</p>\n<p>“I want to table it indefinitely because this whole thing is really tedious and unnecessary and it could stop a lot of things in the process that are unnecessary,” Blant said. “We shouldn’t be deciding anything right now, if anything we should be talking about it later but deciding something and sticking it on at the end of this bill that really doesn’t make any sense if you think about it, would be a waste of our time.”</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 15.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">The Senate decided to table the motion indefinitely and to take no further action.</span></p>\n<p>College of Letters &amp; Science Senator Zach Goulhiane initially proposed a resolution to extend the special elections deadline because midterm elections and midterm exams occurred during the same week.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point in us pretty much cancelling this out. We’re pretty much silencing people’s voices,” Goulhiane said. “Giving them this extra time just until Sunday allows them to actually be able to voice their opinions.”</p>\n<p>Goulhiane said that according to the A.S. Legal Code, a certain number of votes must be met during the elections and so far there has been a low voter turnout.</p>\n<p>“We had three percent on Tuesday, based off of what I just heard today,” Goulhiane said. “After a day we reached five percent.”</p>\n<p>According to Goulhiane, in order to pass the A.S. Legal Resource Center fee increase on the ballot at least 15 percent of the total students’ voter population have to vote yes on the referendum.</p>\n<p>In addition to the needed 15 percent of votes, the fee increase will only become valid with a “20 percent overall turnout,” according to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Erika Martinez said the A.S. Legal Resource Center has been campaigning for votes through outlets like University Announcements, Facebook and the <em>Daily Nexus</em>. According to Martinez, the Resource Center should not have been campaigning for votes since they did not submit a campaign bond, which would have ensured that a fee would be charged if they were to break campaigning rules.</p>\n<p>Martinez said the Senate is also to blame for the contradiction between the elections committee’s decision and the Senate’s decision regarding putting the bill on the ballot.</p>\n<p>“They as a committee voted not to have this put on to the ballot and then we, as Senate said ‘Yes, we should put this on the ballot,’” Martinez said. “So technically, this shouldn’t even be on the ballot, because this campaign bond was never submitted and we were all aware of it.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kevin Koo said Senators have a responsibility to ensure a fair and easy voting process.</p>\n<p>“As Senators, we’re also representing our student community,” Koo said. “People not having the opportunity to read the language in the ballot is, in my opinion, very wrong and unfair towards both the LRC and the candidates who are running.”</p>\n<p>The Senate discussed other options in reaching the required percentage of students needed to vote, but ultimately decided against the resolution to extend the special elections deadline.</p>\n<p>The Senate also approved a bill that outlines guidelines for publicizing conferences and retreats as well as clarified consequences for not attending these events.</p>\n<p><strong>[Correction:</strong> A previous version of this article and the headline incorrectly referred to A.S.

According to statistics gathered by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZiVslx1Zpce-fvuGn8yvnFz-mH8C2ARHqoMWC8rNPs4/edit?usp=sharing\">a <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey</a> randomly sampling 376 students, 40.7 percent of students have tried some psychoactive prescription drug at least once in their life and 35 percent have tried Adderall at least once, with 25.4 percent noting that they did it specifically for school and only 1.1 percent stating that they used it specifically for ADHD.</p>\n<p>The survey has also found that some students take amphetamine stimulants such as Vyvanse, Dexedrine and Dextrostat as well as benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Klonopin and Ativan to study, for recreation, to treat medical conditions or for other purposes.</p>\n<p>According to Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta, the statistics “sound accurate,” as many students who come to Student Health seek consultation and treatment for ADHD or attention deficit disorder (ADD) either because of concerns about their condition or because they feel medication “can help them study, help them concentrate, can help them prepare for tests.”</p>\n<p>“The percentage of students who say that they have tried it are probably not using the medications as prescribed … but reporting their uses more as experimentation or [to] improve their study habits or study skills,” Kurta said, “particularly for Adderall.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, according to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey, 87.7 percent of students who have used Adderall do not have a prescription.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Between the immediate gratification of a text and computer access and the Internet’s speed [and] the need to be multitasking these options all day long … we tend to distract ourselves quite a lot and don’t give ourselves the opportunity to focus as much. — Jackie Kurta</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kurta said she is concerned about assumptions that many students make about the projected risk of prescription drug abuse, claiming that students wrongly assume that because prescription drug use is widespread, it is safe.</p>\n<p>“These are very potent medications, and they need to be properly assessed, properly diagnosed, properly dosed and properly managed.” Kurta said. “We certainly don’t want to give people the impression that anybody can take anything and it’ll help them. There are risks.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58015\" style=\"width: 314px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"954950762\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58013\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58015\" data-attachment-id=\"58015\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/drugs-front-photo-page-by-kenneth-song_for-11-06-2014-5918/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=2832%2C4256&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2832,4256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415234785\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5918\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58015\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918-681x1024.jpg?resize=304%2C457\" alt=\"Lecturer Kendall Hassemer believes the use of these drugs may be due to increased academic pressure and over-stimulation of students’ current surrounding environment.

People tend to think that there’s a reduced risk with Adderall because so many people are prescribed it when really there are risks involved. You don’t know how your body will respond to it.” Peters also said she doubts many Adderall users have prescriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Are So Many Students Doing It?</strong></p>\n<p>Exercise &amp; Sports Studies 2 (ESS2)/Substance Abuse lecturer Kendall Hassemer said students are facing increasing pressure within the education system to “perform perfectly,” which sets students up for cycles of high anxiety, depression and drug-seeking behavior in order to cope with stress. According to her, these problems are symptomatic of the overstimulation students are inundated with in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>“I do believe that this greater focus on ADD/ADHD is due to increased awareness as well as continual nervous system exposure and overstimulation of the current surrounding environment,” Hassemer said in an email. “Research has shown that internet/communications and electronic devices alter neurotransmitter and brain function over time.”</p>\n<p>Kurta agrees and said she thinks prescription drugs are used among students who do not necessarily have behavioral conditions but in actuality need “a quick fix to be able to blast through [studying].”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s kind of a byproduct of the way our society is now operating in terms of our ability to multitask,” Kurta said. “Between the immediate gratification of a text and computer access and the Internet’s speed [and] the need to be multitasking these options all day long, I think we do in ourselves promote this idea that we can’t focus on any one thing when in fact we tend to distract ourselves quite a lot and don’t give ourselves the opportunity to focus as much.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year economics major Michael, with constant increase in pressures from the university to academically succeed and with pressure at internships or jobs to excel, “study drugs become more and more of a thing” as more students feel as though they must compete with one another.</p>\n<p>“The fact that students know [the dangers] and still take them, even relying on these drugs, just shows the types of environments and pressures that are put on all of the students of the U.S. education system,” he said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have friends that didn’t want to try [prescription drugs] but with the pressures of school and the easy access to them, they ended up using them … They are addictive drugs and if you abuse them, they will be detrimental and they’ll be useless in the context of academics. —Quinn</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second-year engineering major Kenneth said that while the use of study drugs may seem to help, it can create a psychological dependence that would not have been previously there.</p>\n<p>“I have heard from friends I’ve talked to that they are great and even if they don’t make you study harder they make the process more enjoyable,” he said. “On the other hand, some have said that they often think if they had never started [taking these drugs] they wouldn’t need it now.”</p>\n<p>However, according to fourth-year political science major Nikolai, the use of prescription drugs such as Adderall is not as detrimental as some claim it to be.</p>\n<p>“I take Adderall on an occasional basis and it has no apparent long-term detrimental side affects. It has certainly saved my ass on more than one occasion in an academic respect,” Nikolai said. “I feel like it won’t be the last time it will.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Quinn said she thinks that the overuse of drugs, at least at UCSB, stems not just from the pressure to succeed, but also from easy access. She said that even though these drugs are legal, “they are still, very much, drugs.”</p>\n<p>“I have friends that didn’t want to try [prescription drugs] but with the pressures of school and the easy access to them, they ended up using them,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58016\" style=\"width: 395px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1471172757\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58013\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58016\" data-attachment-id=\"58016\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/drugs-front-photo-page-by-kenneth-song_for-11-06-2014-5946/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415235563\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5946\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58016\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946-1024x681.jpg?resize=385%2C256\" alt=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5946\" width=\"385\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey found that 34.8 percent of students have used Adderall at least once and that 18.4 percent of students have used Xanax at least once. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Fixing the Symptoms Instead of Solving the Problem<br>\n</strong><br>\nAccording to Kurta, a lot of students that come to the Alcohol &amp; Drug program find themselves turning to not just “study drugs,” but also to anti-anxiety medication such as Xanax in order to feel relief from stress or trauma.</p>\n<p>“They do talk about the fact that some of their use is prompted by a feeling of some relief from stress, relief from anxiety — many from feelings of depression, or loneliness or traumatic situations that have occurred,” Kurta said.</p>\n<p>Peters agreed and said that widespread use of benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Klonopin and Ativan can lead to detrimental and even possibly fatal results.</p>\n<p>“With Xanax, a lot of people think its fine since it’s so widely prescribed for anxiety, not realizing they’re very potent,” Peters said, “especially when accidentally or purposefully mixed with alcohol, it can be deadly.”</p>\n<p>According to Hassemer, our continuously competitive academic environment coupled with college students’ natural inclination to experiment are both elements that factor into student inclination to abuse pharmaceutical drugs.</p>\n<p>“The high-stress environment of a college campus, linked with exposure to prescription drugs, and even natural curiosity of this age group, makes it more likely for experimentation and dangerous, even life-threatening habits to form,” Hassemer said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak … An anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what’s happening. And a lot of these drugs are that. We’re getting our children through education by anaesthetizing them. — Sir Ken Robinson</p></blockquote>\n<p>So let’s say school is the problem. Then what? When all is said and done, is there anything anyone can do to mitigate the prescription drug problem?</p>\n<p>According to notable author, speaker and international advisor in education Sir Ken Robinson in a Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts (RSA) lecture titled “Changing Education Paradigms,” diagnosis of ADHD has risen in parallel with the growth of standardized testing, a phenomenon which he said is no coincidence.</p>\n<p>“Our children are living in the most intensely stimulating period in the history of the earth,” Robinson said in the lecture. “They’re being besieged with information and calls for their attention from every platform — computers, from iPhones, from advertising hoardings, from hundreds of television channels — and we’re penalizing them now for getting distracted. From what? Boring stuff at school, for the most part.”</p>\n<p>Robinson, who points out that the public school system was modeled to meet the needs of industrialism in the 19th century, advocates for a reassessment of our current education model in order to meet 21st century standards. He also points to Ritalin and Adderall as “quite dangerous drugs” given to students to force them to focus in a model of education that is outdated.</p>\n<p>“And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak … An anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what’s happening,” Robinson said. “And a lot of these drugs are that. We’re getting our children through education by anaesthetizing them.”</p>\n<p>According to Robinson, the increased usage of prescription drugs points to a necessity to change the educational paradigm. This means doing away with Industrial Age methods of schooling such as ringing bells, separate facilities specialized into separate subjects and separating school children by age. Instead, Robinson states that we must start looking at ways to encourage creativity and divergent thinking into the school system.</p>\n<p>Whether his advice rings true or not, one thing is for certain — a significant chunk of students are medicating themselves in order to get by, and unless either students or school systems change, prescription drugs are here to stay.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zDZFcDGpL4U\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>This story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, November 6, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexu<em>s. </em><em>Some names in this article have been changed on condition of anonymity.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/","id":3436,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[3435,3434,3433],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Geographer Receives Plous Award","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Assistant professor of geography Krzysztof Janowicz was recently awarded the 2014-2015 Harold J.

Plous Award by the College of Letters and Sciences for his outstanding performance as a junior faculty member.</p>\n<p>The Plous Award is one of the university’s oldest and most prestigious honors, established in 1957 in honor of assistant professor of economics Harold J. Plous who died at 32 years old after only three years in the position. The award is given to new and junior faculty members early in their careers with the university.</p>\n<p>Janowicz, who received recognition for his research in the geographic information science and “geoinformatics” fields, is scheduled to give the annual Harold J. Plous lecture next Spring as part of his appointment.</p>\n<p>Dean of Science and professor of physics Pierre Wiltzius said he believes Janowicz has been an impressive junior scholar from the start of his career at the university several years ago.</p>\n<p>“He has been with us now maybe for something like two years, and I was actually part of helping recruit him with the geography department,” Wiltzius said.</p>\n<p>“Among a very strong competitive pool of candidates he was the strongest already, so we were very lucky to be able to attract him in a very important area of geography.”</p>\n<p>According to geography professor Dar Roberts, Janowicz’s work in mobile computing and GPS based location services is especially relevant today.</p>\n<p>“The growing way we use smart phones, tablets or other devices to navigate our cars, find good restaurants, stores that sell specialized items, or simply look for things in geographic space,” Roberts said. “You can easily imagine that research that makes this easier and more accurate is of high interest.”</p>\n<p>Professor and chair of geography Dan Montello said the Plous Award demonstrates more than creative work and research.</p>\n<p>“I would emphasize that this is not only about being a talented junior professor, but it’s about already getting involved in campus life,” Montello said. “And that means intellectual activity both within your department and outside your department, I think those are important criteria.”</p>\n<p>According to Montello, starting this year Janowicz will chair the Cognitive Science Program, a position usually filled by a tenured professor instead of a junior professor, which is not a tenured position. The program gives graduate students the option of adding a Ph.D. emphasis in cognitive science.</p>\n<p>Wiltzius said the department is honored to have such a distinguished colleague as Janowicz.</p>\n<p>“We’re very proud that one of the members of the science division won this very prestigious prize. I couldn’t be happier for Janowicz and also for the Department of Geography, which is a highly ranked department,” Wiltzius said. “It’s one of the highest ranking geography departments of the country.”</p>\n<p>According to Wiltzius, Janowicz’s studies center around Geographic Information Science.</p>\n<p>“[GIS] is how we deal with all the information that relates one way or another to geography,” Wiltzius said. “The big data bases, all the information that comes from sensors whether they are terrestrial, satellite or airplane based. It’s a rapidly growing area that’s a little bit between geography and computer science, so it’s really a very exciting area that our geography department wants to be in.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, November 6, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/","id":2342,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2341,2340,2339],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Model U.N.

The opening ceremony will be held in Girvetz Hall, large committees will be in the Theater &amp; Dance Building, small committees will be in the Student Resource Building and the closing ceremony will be in Isla Vista Theater.</p>\n<p>According to SBIMUN Security Council Chair and fourth-year political science and Italian double major Jane Huson, their event is relatively new compared to those held at other universities and will provide students with good preparation for future MUN conferences.</p>\n<p>“Our conference is pretty new and more of an educational one since it is hosted in the fall and a lot of colleges send newer delegates so they can experience it in a less intimidating environment,” Huson said. “A lot of students will go to the New York MUN in the spring and the Berkeley MUN in the winter so this is a jumping off point for the students.”</p>\n<p>The number of travel conferences MUN will be able to attend depends on how much funding they collect from hosting home conferences. The team is planning to attend conferences in New York, Davis, Berkeley and Los Angeles this school year.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN Human Rights Council and third-year global studies Benjamin Pu said the conference will be a great learning opportunity for many students.</p>\n<p>“This is a great training conference, and for many schools it will be the first conference of the year,” Pu said. “We provide a thorough and rigorous environment for rules and procedures and also emphasize educational aspects as well.”</p>\n<p>Huson said around 400 to 450 delegates from 18 universities throughout California are expected to be at the conference, including UC San Diego, UC Davis, University of Southern California and Stanford University.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN World Food Program and first-year pre-economics Jason Tsao said he looks forward to the event.</p>\n<p>“This is my first time chairing for a MUN conference and even though it’s going to be a long three days, I’m excited,” Tsao said. “There are training sessions held weekly and that’s where delegates will learn what to do at the conferences.”</p>\n<p>According to Huson, there will be four committee sessions spread out over three days with the opening ceremony introducing chairs, committees and a guest speaker. Each committee will have two topics for discussion and will be chaired by MUN students.</p>\n<p>Huson said MUN members can learn how to be better delegates through hosting a conference.</p>\n<p>“Conferences are super helpful because students are chairing and facilitating the debates,” Huson said. “Chairs who are members will see what makes people good delegates so when they go to travel conferences they can know how to better behave and win prizes and learn what goes into writing a good resolution.”</p>\n<p>MUN will host two more annual conferences, the Gaucho Model United Nations High School Conference and the Central Coast Scrimmage, on Feb. 14-15 and May 2 respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58011\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58011\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/","id":2306,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[2305,2304,2303],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Campus Student Advocacy Unit to “provide free and confidential peer support, advice, and assistance to any student, student organization, or student group involved in a dispute with any entity within the University community.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Garcia said the idea for the bill arose when fourth-year sociology and psychology major and A.S. President Ali Guthy expressed concerns about the structure and operation regarding the OSA.</p>\n<p>“The concern regarding the current structure and operation of the office was ultimately this: if the Student Advocate General is meant to advocate for the entire student body as a whole, how can the elected individual, properly advocate for the rights of the whole student body when only dealing with on-campus issues such as plagiarism and dormitory write-ups?” Garcia said in an email.</p>\n<p>Guthy said that while the OSA conducts specific casework for individual students who encounter disciplinary problems on campus, there could be a better way to serve all students.</p>\n<p>“This type of individualized service is not offered by any other elected executive officer or their staff, considering there are alternative structures within the association that serve to facilitate this need,” Guthy said in an email. “As executives, I believe it is the responsibility of our offices and ourselves to advocate for all UCSB students as opposed to assisting with individual cases because we are elected by the entire student body.”</p>\n<p>Second-year CC] literature major, SAG candidate and current OSA outreach coordinator Ethan Reul said that without casework, the OSA would operate like an “umbrella” for other advocacy groups and would be saddled with additional responsibilities.</p>\n<p>“The SAG would then be responsible for the oversight and management of all these advocacy groups as well as kind of advocating on a more university-wide level as opposed to just the on-campus issues that the OSA currently deals with,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>Guthy also said this new CSA unit would settle in with other advocacy units on campus and broaden the spectrum of student support, which already includes the Legal Resource Center and the Isla Vista Tenants Union.</p>\n<p>“The new unit this bill seeks to create, Campus Student Advocacy (CSA), will fit perfectly within this structure as the CSA would conduct casework to assist students who receive on-campus violations,” Guthy said in an email. “The formation of the CSA would create a holistic approach and structure for advocacy in associated students, as the ‘Advocacy Units’ would now address housing issues, off-campus issues, and on-campus issues.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, this bill would better serve students because it would provide a more cohesive relationship among groups on campus striving to help students.</p>\n<p>“For me, the biggest reason is that this bill proposes a new model that will facilitate a more positive, synchronized relationship between the SAG and now multiple advocacy groups, specializing in different aspects of student rights,” Guthy said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year CCS literature major and former SAG Bailey Loverin said the new bill could take the OSA “five steps backwards” from when it was previously restructured.</p>\n<p>“The new unit will not have the administrative clout of the OSA under the SAG, the SAG will be reduced to a figurehead position, confidentiality could be seriously compromised, you can’t guarantee non-partisan chairs so students could feel unsafe going to the unit, you can’t force them to attend office hours and meetings, the list goes on,” Loverin said in an email.</p>\n<p>Reul said Guthy had initially brought the bill to the OSA, but after the OSA decided not to split the office, Guthy went ahead and presented the bill to the senate. While there was some debate between the two, it ultimately met with compromise.</p>\n<p>“Ali went ahead and decided that she wanted to present it to senate anyway. Technically, it was a professional courtesy that she brought it to us; she did not need to,” Reul said. “However, because she did, we were kind of put off by the fact that she went ahead and did it anyway. So we kind of got into a bit of a heated argument with her and we came to the compromise of postponing, rather than completely eliminating or going through with the bill.”</p>\n<p>Reul said he would support the bill if it were more closely examined and revised, particularly after a new SAG is elected.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that when we do have a Student Advocate General, [they] work more closely with Ali on the creation of this bill so that way when it finally does go through, it’s in the best interest of Associated Students and the student body as a whole,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Attorney General Hector Contreras said the bill in its current form could be deemed unconstitutional according to the A.S. Legal Code and that it would be best to wait until a new SAG is elected before going forward with the bill.</p>\n<p>“If the bill were to be passed as it is now, under my interpretation it would be unconstitutional because it is preventing the Student Advocate General from providing oversight and direction to their office as there is no current elected SAG,” Contreras said in an email.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57926\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57926\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/","id":3437,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[3436,3435,3434],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2014 Midterm Election Results: Capps, Williams Re-elected, GOP Takes Senate","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Santa Barbara County Clerk-Recorder’s Office released its final numbers shortly after 11:30p.m. on election day yesterday evening, posting results for state, federal, and local contests relevant...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57922\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57922\" data-attachment-id=\"57922\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/election-day-by-anna-kodelashvili_for-11-04-2014w-5758/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,798\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415125289\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.04\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Election Day by Anna Kodelashvili_for 11.04.2014w-5758\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57922\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758-1024x680.jpg?resize=500%2C333\" alt=\"Lois Capps, who has retained her seat in the House of Representatives, visited campus yesterday to urge students to vote.

Abboud, at 22 years old, is the youngest trustee ever elected to the board.</p>\n<p>Statewide ballot propositions 1, 2 and 47 also passed, while propositions 45, 46 and 48 all failed by large majorities. Proposition 1, which passed with 66.7 percent of the vote, authorizes roughly $7 billion in general obligation bonds toward water infrastructure projects, while Prop 2, which passed with 68.8 percent of the vote, amends the California Constitution to require annual transfer of state general fund revenues to a “budget stabilization account,” with half the funds to be used to pay off state debts while the other half will be used in the case of “emergencies” or budget deficits. Prop 47, which passed with 58.4 percent of the vote, reduced the penalties for certain drug crimes from felonies to misdemeanors.</p>\n<p>Proposition 45, which requires the state’s Insurance Commissioner’s approval before a health insurer can change its rates, failed to get more than 40.1 percent of the vote. Proposition 46, which required drug testing for physicians, also went down with 67.2 percent of voters saying no.</p>\n<p>In national elections, the Republicans picked up seven seats in the U.S. Senate, gaining a majority in that house for the party for the first time since 2007. The GOP also picked up 13 seats in the House of Representatives, placing majorities in both houses of Congress in control of the Republicans.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-57927\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The UCSB Faculty Association held a town hall meeting to discuss the health insurance plan created by the University of California Office of the President.</p></div>\n<p>The Faculty Association held a town hall meeting in Corwin Pavilion yesterday afternoon issuing an open letter addressing their concerns with the recent transition to UC Care, a systemwide Preferred Provider Organization health insurance plan (PPO) created by the UC Office of the President specifically for UC faculty.</p>\n<p>According to the letter, under UC Care, implemented earlier this year, faculty and staff do not have the same access to health care plans as staff on other UC campuses. The letter also states the Santa Barbara area also lacks tier-one health insurance options, which would provide generic medications instead of specialty and brand name medication.</p>\n<p>President of the Faculty Association Nelson Lichtenstein said there are several issues with the UC Care plan as it applies to university faculty. According to Lichtenstein, one main problem was that Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital is not included in the UC Insurance Plan, and there is an extra cost to faculty who get care provided to them by the hospital.</p>\n<p>“The UC Care health system is a set-up that is clearly not working. The most important hospital, the only one, is not part of that system,” Lichtenstein said. “We have staff that need to use the facility that can’t use it without it costing them more money.”</p>\n<p>According to the letter, the transition to UC Care eliminated the university faculty’s access to Anthem/Blue Cross provided coverage, which the letter states poses numerous problems in the quality of faculty care.</p>\n<p>“This transition has generated difficulties at all campuses, but at Santa Barbara the elimination of Anthem/Blue Cross and the introduction of UC Care as a replacement have resulted in a series of inequities related to level of care, the cost of care, and the availability and continuity of care,” the letter states.</p>\n<p>The letter also states that while the Sansum Clinic, another regional healthcare provider for Santa Barbara, is included in UC Care as a tier-one option, the coverage it provides is “incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Sansum Clinic has signed on to UC Care, but only on a year by year basis. Santa Barbara Select HMO, an association of independent physicians serving our community, is not part of the UC Care tier one network,” the letter states. “Meanwhile, other UC campuses without medical centers, notably Santa Cruz and Riverside, have been able to convince officials in the Office of the President to negotiate with and secure UC Care tier-one coverage by local providers and hospitals in their communities.”</p>\n<p>The letter additionally cites issues presented by signing up with Sansum, including long wait times for an initial appointment with a doctor, existing limits on the capacity of Sansum to provide access to faculty and the extra costs incurred by getting care at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital as a tier-two provider.</p>\n<p>Lichtenstein said that without the Cottage Hospital, patients are forced to go to Los Angeles for the next closest hospital.</p>\n<p>“It’s the only quality hospital in the area before LA and for faculty suffering chronic illnesses, 30 percent of the faculty is above 60, they would be consigned to go to UCLA, which is not practical,” Lichtenstein said.</p>\n<p>According to Lichtenstein, other UC Campuses are also having problems with the implementation of the new insurance policies at other campuses.</p>\n<p>“Other campuses aren’t particularly happy either, Santa Cruz is one of them,” Lichtenstein said. “Turns out UC Health care hospitals aren’t designed to treat everyday illnesses, they’re for research and they’re good at it … even UCLA has problems with their rates going way up. We’re particularly pissed because our rates went up too but we aren’t getting access to the best hospital between L.A and San Francisco. UCOP should have thought about that before they made it system-wide.”</p>\n<p>Faculty members such as professor of geography Ray Smith posed suggestions to solve the UC Health program’s lack of coverage.</p>\n<p>“Going back to trying to do something independent, they could send a delegation to UCLA and see if they could send a satellite hospital to UCSB,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Faculty Advisor to the Chancellor’s Office Richard Watts said UC Care may eventually close down on its own.</p>\n<p>“Come 2016 we could be on the edge of having UC Care so expensive it will run out of business anyhow,” Watts said.</p>\n<p>During the discussion, questions were raised regarding the effectiveness of the letter to Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Several attendees said a possible first step would be to meet with Yang in a group setting to openly discuss the issues.</p>\n<p>Professor of Physics Harry N. Nelson said the problem with the letter to Yang is that it did not produce responses.</p>\n<p>“Given that there was a major problem last year, I’m kind of surprised they never want to come back and see what happened,” Nelson said. “If they actively don’t want to check back, tactically it’s unimaginable that they don’t care enough to see if their solution worked.”</p>\n<p>The town hall ended with a general consensus to meet with Yang for further discussion of premiums and quality of care and begin taking action by the end of the open enrollment period for this year, toward changes in the upcoming year.</p>\n<p>According to Lichtenstein, further action needs to be taken soon.</p>\n<p>“I think the takeaway from this meeting is we weren’t just making accusations, we chose Kum-Kum [Bhavnani] to delegate a committee to explore our options,” Lichtenstein said. “Whether that is legal action or anything else, we need to begin to negotiate right now with UCOP so we can start to make decisions.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Ray Smith as an entomology professor.

One revision is the inclusion of “dating partners” under the definition of “intimate partners,” allowing victims to seek protection from domestic violence and stalking.</p>\n<p>The Pause for Gun Safety Act would allow friends or family members to seek a temporary “gun violence prevention order” if they fear that someone close to them is posing a threat to themselves or others. The gun violence prevention order would effectively prohibit, for a brief period, a given individual from purchasing or possessing a firearm and grant authorities permission to confiscate firearms already in possession.</p>\n<p>According to Capps, voting certain candidates into office, such as herself, will allow for changes in legislation to happen.</p>\n<p>“I’ve supported legislation ever since I got there; the relationship between gun violence and domestic violence, safety issues and now in this case, allowing a parent or someone else in a position of recognizing someone might be a danger to themselves or others, to intervene in time for the guns to be confiscated,” Capps said.</p>\n<p>Since the events of May 23, Martinez said he has toured the country, visiting 11 states as well as Washington D.C. in a campaign to change state legislation regarding gun safety.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, solving gun violence issues requires more than one answer.</p>\n<p>“There’s no one solution to gun violence; it’s a multifaceted problem,” Martinez said, “There isn’t one solution to this kind of thing. You make changes that incrementally solve the issue.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said voting is a response that is one potential solution to gun violence.</p>\n<p>“Voting matters,” Martinez said. “It’s a black-and-white choice.”</p>\n<p>According to Capps, gun control is not the only pressing issue in this “critical” election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always been a champion for making college more affordable,” Capps said. “We want to make sure that we protect the environment, that we put people to work in projects that will bring our economy forward, take advantage of alternative energy other than fossil fuels. There’s protecting Medicare and social security. There’s all kinds of issues at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, Capps went door-to-door in I.V. to ask community members to vote the next day. This morning, she was up at 5:00 a.m. to hang pamphlets on the doorknobs of the residences in I.V. to remind voters to turn in ballots.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of excitement in this election, so they forget about the ballot, it’s still sitting on top of the refrigerator, and then they say ‘Oh my gosh, I have this ballot here!’ Well they can take it to any polling place,” Capps said, “And there’s several of them around Isla Vista and UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hillel, Saint Michael’s University Church, Saint Mark’s University Parish and Merton Housing Co-Op are all polling places located in I.V., while on-campus voters can go to the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge, the Loma Pelona Center and the Linda Vista Room in Santa Catalina.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/","id":3632,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[3631,3630,3629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AS Finance and Business Committee Freezes S.C.O.R.E Finances, Hears Requests","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Monday night, the Associated Students Finance Board discussed the Students of Color Conference, funding for various campus organizations including the A.S.

Finance and Business Committee discussed the Students of Color Conference, funding for various campus organizations including the A.S. Food Bank and the Mock Trial team and also placed a freeze on the account used by the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E) over alleged lack of clear information on where the group’s funding is being used.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez spoke on behalf of A.S. President Ali Guthy on the upcoming Students of Color Conference event held by S.C.O.R.E. After discussion, the meeting passed a motion to freeze S.C.O.R.E’s finance account, which will be sent to the Senate on Wednesday for ratification.</p>\n<p>According to Chief Financial Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus, S.C.O.R.E has been vague regarding their use of funds.</p>\n<p>“There had been a clear misunderstanding of everything they’ve been doing,” Theus said, “They are not being transparent with us as Board.”</p>\n<p>According to Márquez, A.S. did not receive adequate information on the planning and selection processes of the upcoming Student of Color Conference, to be held this weekend at UC Merced, to no fault of the organization.</p>\n<p>“We need to know more information about the Student of Color Conference in the planning as well as the selection process,” Márquez said. “We want to know what has been the process been so far in selecting who the delegates will be to the conference and how they were chosen. They were not aware of this responsibility of giving us this information and as they hadn’t necessarily done this function on behalf of A.S. before, I believe their responses were genuine.”</p>\n<p>According to S.C.O.R.E. diversity educator and second-year biology major Kyron Covington and outreach coordinator Allison Bettencourt, the group needed funds for additional applicants because current funds had already been used.</p>\n<p>“We had to reopen the application process to accommodate an increase in applications,” Covington said. “The funds had already been processed.”</p>\n<p>In addition, mental health awareness organization Active Minds, a campus group dedicated to mental health awareness, requested $1,162.50 to fund Stigma Free UCSB, a public forum event where student organizations can discuss issues and struggles with mental health and the lack of safe spaces. The group said the event is aimed towards addressing lack of representation of mental health groups on campus.</p>\n<p>The Muslim Student Association (MSA) also requested funds from the A.S. Finance and Business Committee. Student representative for MSA Altamash Azam said the group’s first event, a barbeque on Goleta Beach, requires $377.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be an open public forum anyone who has a question for the average Muslim student, open to general public,” Azam said. “We’re anticipating about 40 people and we’re contacting other religious groups on campus to accomplish one of our long-term goals of communication amongst the groups.”</p>\n<p>According to Captains of Mock Trial, Andrew Cavarno and Brett Russell and Vice President, Cheryl Wilson, their upcoming Yale Invitational conference is a rare occasion, and requires funds to transport the team to and from the airport once it arrives in Connecticut.</p>\n<p>“In the history of our program we have never been able to compete in this national tournament,” Russell said. “We have begun to establish ourselves as national powerhouse after last year and we have received invitations to these East Coast tournaments. We would greatly benefit from this.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[Correction: This article and the accompanying headline incorrectly referred to the AS Finance and Budget Committee as the the AS Finance Board. That is incorrect. The article has been updated accordingly.]</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously incorrectly stated Kyron Covington’s position as S.C.O.R.E. “co-chair”, and incorrectly stated Allison Bettencourt’s position as “club historian”.

Unlike his opponent, who has no prior experience with the office, Reul has worked in the office for the last six months and has attained enough experience to know what the office needs.</p>\n<p>He also has a concrete plan ready to maintain and improve upon the current functions of the office with specific points, which makes him a better choice than his opponent. While Reul plans on keeping all the current employees of the office, something his opponent has also stated she would do, his plan for the office is more concrete. This includes a much needed modernization of the SAG website, advocacy workshops and outreach to various student organizations to create safe houses in Isla Vista, continuation of the Legal Observers program as well as efforts to increase communication with advocacy offices on other UC campuses.</p>\n<p>While his platform primarily focuses on continuing the work begun by his predecessor, the unique situation of a resignation in the middle of the current term of the SAG presents challenges not faced by candidates that would otherwise come into the office in June. While we support his opponent’s commitment to keeping the advocacy and casework aspects of the office unified, her lack of prior experience with the office and with Associated Students places her at a disadvantage we believe makes her the less suitable choice for the office.</p>\n<p><strong>External Vice President of Local Affairs: Cameron Schunk</strong></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"57812\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/associated-students-special-election-endorsements-2014/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?fit=480%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"480,480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?fit=480%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-57812\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">The <em>Daily Nexus</em> endorses Cameron Schunk for the position of External Vice President of Local Affairs. Although running unopposed, Schunk’s heavy involvement in efforts toward Isla Vista self-governance make him the perfect candidate for the position of EVPLA.</p>\n<p>With a well-informed understanding of possible forms of self-governance, particularly in the process of making I.V. a community services district or legislative district, Schunk has already taken initiative to make I.V. a safer place by founding Students for a Safer Isla Vista, forming relationships with county officials and local legislators and by helping to lead I.V. self-governance town halls. Schunk’s plans to actively reach out to Latino families in I.V. and to address sexual assault by providing survivors safe opportunities to share their experiences with the community are goals that we feel appropriately address some of I.V.’s most pressing issues. In addition, his plans to increase EVPLA presence online, put the I.V. Community Center to use and document housing conditions in I.V. are goals we feel Schunk has the ability to deliver.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, his passion for using the EVPLA position as an avenue to forward the movement toward self-governance for I.V. makes him best suited for the job.</p>\n<h2><strong>Fee Endorsements</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>A.S. Legal Resource Center</strong></p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> does not endorse the proposed fee increase of $9.37 per student per Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer Quarters beginning Fall 2015 and decreasing to $6.84 in Fall 2019 for the Associated Students Legal Resource Center. Much of the increased funding would go to a Sobering Center program in Isla Vista that would allow first timer offenders of alcohol-related crimes to stay in a building until they sober up, ultimately avoiding a court case or jail time. We believe that the establishment of a Sobering Center would both incentivize irresponsible behavior in regards to reducing the consequences for underage drinking as well as discriminate unfairly against non-UCSB students who are residents of I.V. and would be denied assistance by the new center. The Sobering Center seeks to essentially augment and subvert the traditional legal process for drunk in public offenses for those fortunate enough to attend UCSB, while doing nothing for the broader community.</p>\n<p>We recognize the importance of the A.S. Legal Resource Center in assisting students with legal issues and providing legal advice and therefore would be inclined to support a fee increase if funds were being allocated directly to improve the current functions of the office and if the requested amount were not as steep as it currently stands.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57811\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/associated-students-special-election-endorsements-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57811\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/associated-students-special-election-endorsements-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/associated-students-special-election-endorsements-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/associated-students-special-election-endorsements-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/associated-students-special-election-endorsements-2014/","id":2992,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2991,2990,2989],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Stays Safe This Halloween","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There were no major incidents in Isla Vista this past Halloween weekend and arrests and citations were down significantly compared to last year’s Halloween attendance, according to a statement from ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57825\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"850436030\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57810\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57825\" data-attachment-id=\"57825\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-02/i-v-stays-safe-this-halloween/halloween-by-william-zhou_for-11-02-2014-1566/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566.jpg?fit=1600%2C913&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,913\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1414793567\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Halloween by William Zhou_for 11.02.2014-1566\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566.jpg?fit=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566.jpg?fit=888%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57825\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566-1024x584.jpg?resize=600%2C342\" alt=\"The rain may have kept out-of-towners away, but didn't dampen the spirits of I.V. residents.

Schunk’s platform focuses on I.V. self-<br> governance and student advocacy through community members, business owners and long-term residents. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Associated Students held a forum at the Arbor on Wednesday for the position of A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, a fourth-year psychology and political science double major, is running unopposed to fill the void previously left by fourth-year sociology and Asian American studies major Beatrice Contreras. The forum was held yesterday afternoon in the Arbor to inform students about Schunk’s platform and goals for the future if elected.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology and Chicano Studies double-major Gerardo Gonzalez, a general member of the elections committee, said no one outside of A.S. asked questions.</p>\n<p>“Questions were centered around his position as a EVPLA, what he was working to accomplish, his thoughts and his experience he’s had with Associated Students and the EVPLA office in Isla Vista,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>According to Cameron, his platform focuses primarily on providing student advocacy and self-governance for the residents of I.V., and there is no one entity responsible for everyone living in I.V.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day we are represented by one of five supervisors on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors,” Schunk said. “Of that one person, we’re only 20 percent of her voter block. We’re not her priority and that’s not because she’s a bad person, it’s because she doesn’t have the resources to dedicate to us effectively. If we have the resources ourselves, we would be able to do it just fine.“</p>\n<p>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Molly Morrison said Schunk’s platform resonated with her and that he demonstrated concern for the future of I.V., a concern she found lacking in many other students.</p>\n<p>“Most students here, because they are so transient, don’t seem to care about the future of UCSB, SBCC students and Isla Vista long-term residents,” Morrison said. “I think his platform for self-governance and overall for culture improvement really speaks to me. If we don’t have anyone to speak for us right now, then who will speak for us in the future?”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, another primary goal of his is to create an “I Support Isla Vista” campaign for community members, business owners, and long-term residents to catalyze advocacy and community interest in I.V.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I’ve noticed in Isla Vista is whenever I attend a county board meeting, it is largely long-term residents that are there. It is because students aren’t aware that those things are happening,” Schunk said. “If we don’t speak, no one will hear us.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he also hopes to have A.S., and eventually the university, provide outreach by providing bilingual publications and announcements.</p>\n<p>“I want A.S. and especially the entire student body to take accountability for the impacts we make on the Isla Vista community,” Schunk said. “Just because you love something, doesn’t mean you always take care of it, even when it needs to be taken care of.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 30, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57650\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57650\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/","id":2985,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2984,2983,2982],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":135,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
