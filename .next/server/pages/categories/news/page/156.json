As an afterthought, the man told the officers the sickly squatter was also bleeding from the forehead.</p>\n<p>Intrigued, the deputies followed the man to his house and into the bathroom. There, they found an 18-year old girl sitting atop a pile of her own puke, completely in the nude, blood trickling down from an eyebrow piercing.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the drunken CSU Northridge student if she knew where she was or whose house she was in, but she didn’t have any idea. Furthermore, the puking princess could not tell the deputies where she staying nor where she lived.</p>\n<p>When asked how much alcohol she had consumed, she said five shots and told the officers she was feeling “drunk.” She did not know how she had caused her piercing to bleed, though the deputies suspected a tumble had caused the injury.</p>\n<p>Fearing that the nude Northridger would end up somewhere she would regret, the officers decided to arrest her for public intoxication. After collecting her clothing, the deputies transported the out-of-towner to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Taxi Cab Blues<br>\nSat., Jan. 31, 10:03 p.m. – Officers on 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were alerted to possible trouble by the sound of a car horn.</p>\n<p>Looking down the street, the deputies spotted a young man staggering down the center of the street, with a yellow taxi right on his heels. The taxi driver was unable to get around the sloppy stroller and, out of frustration, had reverted to repeated use of his horn.</p>\n<p>Despite the ruckus behind him, the inebriated 21-year old refused to step aside. When the officers approached and told the young man to get out of the street, he replied, “Well, you’re walking in the road.”</p>\n<p>The deputies, brushing the failed attempt at argument aside, escorted the man, and the girl that was with him, to the sidewalk. The officers then informed the drunken reveler of the dangers associated with walking down the middle of the street and told him to head straight home. His female counterpart, who the officers learned was his girlfriend, ensured the deputies he would do so and they walked off in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, less than a minute later an argument ensued and the officers watched as the childlike 21-year old pulled away from his girlfriend, shouting that he wasn’t going to go home.</p>\n<p>Having escaped the grasp of his woman, the young man fell right into the hands of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, who arrested him for public intoxication. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Wild Alaska<br>\nSun., Feb. 1, 2:05 a.m. – A young woman walking down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive – swaying as she went – caught the eye of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the clearly intoxicated female stumbled down the center of the street, cell phone in hand. The 19-year old then made for the sidewalk, but when she attempted to step up onto the curb, her foot got caught on the curb and she face-planted onto the cement. The deputies then watched as she sat up and promptly returned to her phone conversation.</p>\n<p>   The officers approached the sidewalk sitter and asked her if she knew where she was. She replied she was either in Las Vegas or Alaska, but could not decide which.</p>\n<p>Somewhat befuddled, the deputies asked if there was anyone she could call to come and get her, and the inebriated UCSB student was quick to dial a number. Explaining it was her brother, and that he would take care of her, she handed the phone to the officer, who introduced himself.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the line, the brother informed the officer that he could not come and get his sister since he was in his home state of Alaska.</p>\n<p>With no other option, the deputies arrested the severely misplaced women and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail. While in transit, however, the Las Vegas native vomited in the back seat of the car. Once out of the car, she fell over, hit her head, and temporarily lost consciousness.</p>\n<p>A nurse attended to the fallen reveler and determined she was too drunk to spend the night in jail and the young woman was subsequently transported to the hospital.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18233\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18233\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/","id":3846,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3845,3844,3843],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Bringing Down the House\n\nFri., Jan. 16, 11:56 p.m. - Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive witnessed two young men climb through the window into an abandoned house.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Bringing Down the House</p>\n<p>Fri., Jan. 16, 11:56 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive witnessed two young men climb through the window into an abandoned house.</p>\n<p>Once inside the house, the two inebriated men were overtaken by drunken douchebaggery. The deputies watched as they proceeded to destroy an assortment of objects in the house by throwing them to the ground.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached, the two troublemakers made for the backdoor and out into the backyard. While one of the males was able to get away, the second got tripped up and fell into the arms of the law.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the intoxicated man why he was in the abandoned house and he replied, “Physic, directed, mutant, genesis.” Confused, the officer asked a second time but the man just repeated himself, “Physic, directed, mutant, genesis.”</p>\n<p>Having taken note of his strange answer, the officer then asked the 23-year old to recite his alphabet. “A, B, C,” he started, “E, G, H, I, H, Z.”</p>\n<p>Feeling certain the man was too intoxicated to take care of himself, the officers arrested and transported him to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Station. While waiting for his paperwork to be completed, the man was placed on a chair in the station’s drunk tank. However, he was too drunk to sit in a chair properly, and, after a few minutes, he fell off the chair and landed on the side of his head, which caused a few small abrasions on his ear and cheek.</p>\n<p>The man was treated for his injuries and then taken to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Go Slugs!</p>\n<p>Sat., Jan 17, 3:08 a.m. – An intoxicated female nearly got run over by two officers driving their patrol car on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road early Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>The 19-year old woman was stumbling down the street with her head down and apparently did not see the approaching police car. Just as the car was about to pass, the inebriated stroller staggered to the side and directly in front of the squad car.</p>\n<p>The officers hit the brakes and backed up the vehicle to talk with the drunken UC Santa Cruz student. The deputies tried to ask the young lady about her condition but had trouble understanding her answers. It seemed to the deputy that the woman’s mouth was filled with something and he asked why. She told the officer she had “cottonmouth” and when asked why she said, “‘Cause there was so much to drink.”</p>\n<p>While she was able to correctly recite her alphabet, the drunken out-of-towner was otherwise at a total loss. She could not understand why she was talking with the police or why they were asking so many questions.</p>\n<p>Despite her confusion, the officers asked the woman, who weighed about 120 pounds, how much alcohol she had consumed. She replied, “Seven shots of vodka and five beers.” With ample evidence, the deputies arrested the Banana Slug for public intoxication and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending a good salting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/","id":3844,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3843,3842,3841],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Could You Help Me Zip Up?\nSat., Jan. 10, 1:02 a.m. - Deputies on a Friday night patrol watched as an inebriated young man stumbled through the front yard of 6662 Del Playa Dr., seemingly searching for...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Could You Help Me Zip Up?<br>\nSat., Jan. 10, 1:02 a.m. – Deputies on a Friday night patrol watched as an inebriated young man stumbled through the front yard of 6662 Del Playa Dr., seemingly searching for a place to relieve himself.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old man found a wall, unzipped and started to drunkenly write his name in urine on the bricks. The officer approached the man and stood behind him as he finished. Ten seconds later, the man was done peeing and face to face with Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The officer escorted him to the curb and asked for his name and date of birth. The piss-drunk pee-er told the officers his name was George Douglas McClaren – a fake – and that his date of birth was 9-21-88 – also fake.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, it didn’t take the officer long to determine he was being lied to and even less time to the arrest the dishonest urinator.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the drunken reveler was transported to the Isla Vista Station while the arrested deputy did the paperwork. A minute later, the dams burst open and Mr. McClaren vomited all over himself and the floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy placed him outside, where he continued to intermediately upchuck on himself. Then the 20-year-old sat motionless with his eyes closed and pissed himself.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Have You Seen My Wife?<br>\nFri., Jan. 2, 4:43 a.m. – Officers working the late shift received a report of two middle-aged men hiding in and shouting from the bushes in front of 6621 Abrego Rd.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, the deputies spotted the two men walking westbound down Abrego. The officers contacted the former bush-lovers, and one of them – a heavily intoxicated 58-year-old – immediately became argumentative and combative.</p>\n<p>Since his age was clearly not a concern, the deputies started by asking why the man was out walking around I.V. at 5 in the morning. His answer was frank, albeit completely untrue. He told the officers he had gotten into a fight with his wife earlier in the night and that she had kicked him out of the house.</p>\n<p>He went on to say that he had been trying to walk his intoxicated friend home when they fell into the bushes.</p>\n<p>A quick call to the Mrs., however, revealed a much different story. She told the officers that she and her husband no longer lived together and that he was currently residing in downtown Santa Barbara. The estranged wife added that her husband had also taken to sleeping in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park with the local transient population.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the officers had plenty to work with and arrested the twiggy man, transporting him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>You Guys Got a Light?<br>\nMon., Jan. 12, 1:49 a.m. – While on patrol, two officers spotted a man staggering down the middle of Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The two officers stood at the corner of Abrego and Camino Del Sur and watched as the man approached. The clearly inebriated man then proceeded to stumble into the middle of the intersection – with two cars fast approaching – and addressed the deputies.</p>\n<p>“You got a light for my cigarette?” he asked.</p>\n<p>The officers kindly asked the man to walk out of the street. The 31-year-old SBCC student refused, however, and shouted, “Fuck you guys,” at the officers.</p>\n<p>Even though the cops had ignored his request for a light, shouting profanities at the police – especially when drunk – is almost never a smart call. The officers walked over to the man, took him by the arm and escorted him to the sidewalk. Once there, they arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18026\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18026\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/","id":3843,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3842,3841,3840],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Approximately 10 males at the corner of Embarcadero Del Norte and Segovia Road who were surrounding a young woman with her back against a fence sparked the interest of patrolling officers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Third Time’s the Charm</p>\n<p>Thurs., Nov. 20, 1:06 a.m. — Approximately 10 males at the corner of Embarcadero Del Norte and Segovia Road who were surrounding a young woman with her back against a fence sparked the interest of patrolling officers.</p>\n<p>The deputies interrupted the lopsided powwow and inquired into the young lady’s welfare. She drunkenly informed the officers she was going to a nearby sorority.</p>\n<p>Despite being unable to complete her ABCs, the deputies allowed the inebriated 18-year-old to go after instructing her to walk straight to the sorority with a man she indicated was her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>The officers then rode their bikes a block away and turned to watch the drunken sorority sister. Instead of walking toward her sorority, however, the young woman and her boy-toy – driven by the drunchies – headed straight for Freebirds.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the pair again and reminded the hungry girl of her instructions. After another failed alphabet test, the deputies let her go once more and continued to watch.</p>\n<p>The pair then walked toward campus and headed into the Pardall tunnel. The deputies stopped her for a third time and asked what she was doing. This time, she informed the officers that she was returning to her dorm room.</p>\n<p>The deputies explained that this was their third time talking with her and asked her how much she had imbibed. She responded by saying, “More than I should have.” At this point, the officers had no option but to arrest her, which they did.</p>\n<p>She was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>But I’m Just Drunk</p>\n<p>Fri., Nov. 21, 5:55 p.m. — A man was spotted stumbling down the sidewalk in front of Berrilicious, forcing Isla Vista’s finest into action.</p>\n<p>Deputies watched as the older male attempted to put one foot in front of the other without much success. On several occasions, the inebriated man lost his balance and nearly fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>The officers stopped the 43-year-old transient and immediately concluded he was exceedingly intoxicated.</p>\n<p>When the deputies attempted to question him, his words were so severely slurred that he could not be understood. After several failed attempts at human conversation, the day-drinking drunk finally admitting to drinking “a beer.” The officers concluded he was either an extreme lightweight, or he was lying about his consumption.</p>\n<p>Either way, a few minutes later he stated that all he had done was “get drunk” and could not understand why he was getting arrested. The officers calmly explained that public intoxication was a crime and subsequently arrested him. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Dare to D.A.R.E.</p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 22, 5:15 p.m. — An officer was on duty at UCSB’s Robertson Gym when he was informed that someone may have been jumping on the hood of a D.A.R.E. patrol car.</p>\n<p>As the deputy was walking out to the car, he noticed a middle-aged male moving away from the vehicle. He stopped the suspect and detained him.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the 36-year-old man what he was doing, but the individual said nothing at first. The deputy asked again, and the suspect said, “I was going to smash the D.A.R.E. vehicle.” He then went on to say, “I wanted to talk to Gregg Wilson so I could see my old swim records. They wouldn’t let me so I jumped on the D.A.R.E. car. I told them I was going to smash it.”</p>\n<p>When asked what the D.A.R.E. car had to do with Gregg Wilson, the seemingly sober man said, “I’m the named assistant swim coach for Gregg Wilson,” and offered no other reasoning.</p>\n<p>The deputy then inspected the car and noticed that the suspect had caused two small dents in the hood.</p>\n<p>The deputy placed the man under arrest and escorted him to his patrol car. Still not understanding, the officer asked once more why the man had jumped on the D.A.R.E. car. The swim-obsessed man replied that he was upset because he couldn’t see his old records. When asked again why jumping on the car had anything to do with seeing the swim records, he said, “I don’t know, I was upset.”</p>\n<p>The man was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending anger management.</p>\n<p>–Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17889\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17889\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/","id":3845,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3844,3843,3842],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Thurs., Oct 23, 5:50 a.m. — Custodial staff working an early morning shift at Ellison Hall on the UCSB campus called the police after coming across a young man asleep outside a door to the build...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Thurs., Oct 23, 5:50 a.m. — Custodial staff working an early morning shift at Ellison Hall on the UCSB campus called the police after coming across a young man asleep outside a door to the building.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista’s finest responded and found the inebriated subject lying upside-down on a handicap ramp. The deputies roused the man from his drunken stupor and assisted him to his feet.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the sidewalk sleeper if he knew where he was and he told them he was in front of Manzanita Village. A deputy directed his attention to the large academic building behind him and again asked the man to describe his surroundings, but the 19-year-old adamantly assured the deputies they were at Manzanita Village and that the offices in Ellison were in fact dorm rooms.</p>\n<p>The severely confused individual then told officers that he lived on Camino Pescadero, that it was just a short walk from Manzanita and that they should just let him walk home. Officers told him he was not close to Camino Pescadero and, despite assuring officers he was, asked if he could call his roommate to walk him home.</p>\n<p>The deputies said he could and he proceeded to reach for his phone. His phone, however, was not there and the still intoxicated man became confused and looked to the officer to ask if he had his cell phone.</p>\n<p>The deputy told him he did not have his cell phone, and instead arrested the young man for public intoxication. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Mon., Oct 27, 4:11 a.m. — At approximately 4:01 a.m., deputies received a report of an intoxicated man trying to gain entry into a house on the 6700 block of Pasado Road.</p>\n<p>The concerned residents told dispatch that the man had begun by repeatedly slamming his body into their sliding glass door, and when that proved ineffective, had moved around to the front door and was banging incessantly trying to gain entry.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived 10 minutes later, they witnessed the heavy set 28-year-old man square up to the front door, push himself forward and, with considerable force, slam the entirety of his excessive weight against the wooden door.</p>\n<p>Despite the man’s sincerest and drunkest efforts, however, the door did not budge.</p>\n<p>The deputies contacted the man and told him to stop throwing himself at the door, which he did. The officers then asked the man — who, incidentally, works for KjEE FM in Santa Barbara — why he was trying to get inside in the residence.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the heavily intoxicated male did not have an answer to this question. In fact, he could not say where he was, how he had come to be in Isla Vista to begin with, or whose house he was attempting to enter.</p>\n<p>All he could say for sure was that he had consumed between five and eight beers that night.</p>\n<p>That was enough for the deputies, though, who arrested the man for public intoxication and allowed him unobstructed entrance into the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>— Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/","id":3889,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3888,3887,3886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat., Oct. 11, 1:17 a.m. -- An officer on a uniformed foot patrol of the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive spotted a heavily intoxicated female being assisted by a male companion.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When the Vomit Hits the Fan</p>\n<p>Sat., Oct. 11, 1:17 a.m. — An officer on a uniformed foot patrol of the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive spotted a heavily intoxicated female being assisted by a male companion.</p>\n<p>Judging that the young woman was unable to walk on her own, the deputy stopped the pair and asked to talk with the inebriated woman. Her escort agreed and quickly left the scene.</p>\n<p>Without the help of her supposed friend, the 18-year-old out-of-towner was unable to maintain her balance and started to dry heave.</p>\n<p>Before the officer could assist the unsteady gal, she began to dry heave so violently that she fell to the ground. Once on the pavement, her dry heaving turned to actual vomiting and the shit hit the fan; she threw up in her hair, on her clothes and all over her legs and feet.</p>\n<p>After she was done upchucking her dinner, lunch and breakfast, the deputy asked her how much she had to drink that night, and she replied with, “I’m good.” Then she told the officer that she was having trouble seeing things.</p>\n<p>After five minutes of sitting on the curb, the officer asked if she could walk. She said she could try, but after two steps nearly fell to the ground.

She had another female with her, but she was not assisting the inebriated.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the 19-year-old woman, and immediately picked up on the strong odor of alcohol coming from her person.</p>\n<p>They asked the young woman where she was coming from and she replied that she had just left her sorority. She was then asked where she was heading, and she replied her sorority.</p>\n<p>When asked how much she had had to drink, she said, “Enough.” After speaking with her friend, the officers learned that they had come from the Phi Sig fraternity house, where the various sororities had been competing in a “gladiator style” sporting event.</p>\n<p>She was arrested and transported to the Isla Vista sub-station on Trigo Road. There she was placed on a chair in the holding cell, but after a half-hour of repeatedly falling off she was moved to the floor.</p>\n<p>Her intoxication seemed to be increasing, and at times she lost consciousness. Then, she began to urinate, soaking her shorts and the ground that she was sitting on. She made no attempt to move and ultimately passed out in a puddle of her own urine.</p>\n<p>The sorority girl was then transported to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for alcohol overdose, but was ultimately released back to the Sheriff’s Dept. and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>–Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/","id":3888,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3887,3886,3885],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Friday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. - A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Watch Your Step</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. – A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling officer.</p>\n<p>The deputy went to check on the well-being of the 19-year-old and immediately noticed the strong odor of alcohol emanating from his person. The not-so-sure-footed partier had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, and his clothes were soiled in what appeared to be his own bodily fluids.</p>\n<p>As the deputy spoke with the now-seated man, he began to vomit vigorously. After he was done regurgitating his dinner, he slumped over to the side, almost landed in his own pile of vomit, and fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>The officer awoke the sickly man and continued questioning him, making sure not to step in the puddle of sick.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the man what he had been drinking, and not surprisingly, the young man stated, “Tequila.”</p>\n<p>Having heard all he needed to hear, the officer arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Marking Your Territory</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:20 p.m. – Officers poking around a Del Playa parking lot came across a young man defacing a stranger’s vehicle.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the 19-year-old UCSB student pulled down his zipper, whipped it out and began urinating on the side of a minivan. He was, however, too drunk to keep his balance and had to use the minivan for support as he relieved himself.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even with the van’s steady support, standing tall was just too difficult and the perp stumbled to the side and started peeing on his own leg.</p>\n<p>An officer walked up behind the man and told him to “zip it up.” Caught red-handed, the young man turned around and still tried to play it cool, telling the officer he hadn’t been urinating.</p>\n<p>His zipper was still down, however, and the officer told him once more to zip it up, which he eventually did. The deputy then began to question the young man, but he proved to be uncooperative.</p>\n<p>Judging that the man was unable to care for himself, the officer arrested the young pisser and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Deaf, Dumb and Blind</b><br>\nSat. Sept. 20, 12:14 a.m. – An SBCC student walking west down Del Playa Drive caught the attention of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>Acting as if he were a human pinball and Del Playa was his alcohol-themed pinball machine, the 20-year-old man was bumping into people left and right as he attempted to navigate the busy street. He had with him a female escort, but not even a pinball wizard could have controlled his reckless walking.</p>\n<p>Then the unsteady stroller bumped into the wrong man, who got up in his face and started shouting. The deputies hastened towards the intoxicated man, hoping to get to him before he got himself into real trouble.</p>\n<p>The officers reached the young man and told him to sit down on the curb, which he did, and started asking him for his information. Due to his level of intoxication, however, he proved difficult to talk to. His speech was so slurred the deputy had to ask him to repeat answers several times before he could comprehend what he was trying to saying.</p>\n<p>He told the officers he had been drinking at a friend’s house and was heading to another friend’s house. Isla Vista’s Finest were forced to disagree, however, and arrested the man right there.

Not surprisingly, the 19-year-old possessed many of the symptoms of heavy intoxication.</p>\n<p>The deputy, relatively unscathed from his run-in with the bike, immediately told the reckless rider to park it on the curb, but the young man would not. After several attempts at ordering him to sit down, the officer had to physically assist him to the curb.</p>\n<p>After finally succeeding in seating the BMX bomber, the deputy was able to assess the situation. He first noticed that the young man was not wearing a shoe on his right foot, a sign of having too much to drink.</p>\n<p>The young man told the officer he had taken three shots earlier in the night, but after failing to complete his ABC’s, he was arrested for public intoxication. In response, the recently arrested cyclist repeatedly told the deputy that he had just been trying to get home and that everything was an “accident.”</p>\n<p>Accident or not, crashing into a police officer while riding a bike is never going to turn out well, and in this case the young man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Where Did You Sleep Last Night?<br>\nSun., Sept. 7, 6:47 a.m.-Deputies working the morning shift received a call concerning a young man passed out on a sidewalk near the intersection of Camino Pescadero and El Greco roads.</p>\n<p>Two officers responded to the call and immediately found the 18-year-old sleeping peacefully on the concrete. He was fully dressed, but the fresh morning light revealed that his t-shirt was covered in what appeared to be his own vomit.</p>\n<p>One of the deputies walked up to the sidewalk sleeper and said, “Police, wake up,” in a low, police-like voice, but the sleeping beauty did not rouse. However, after a little shaking, the young man eventually sat up.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the severely confused man if he knew where he was, but he simply looked up at the deputy with a blank stare on his face.</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked if he knew where he lived, and he responded by saying he lived on “DP.” When asked where on Del Playa, he just shrugged his shoulders and did not respond.</p>\n<p>The SBCC student was then asked if he had too much to drink the night before and he, as anyone who wakes up on a sidewalk should, nodded his head in agreement.</p>\n<p>“Would you like to go to jail?” asked the deputy, and the young man once again nodded his head in agreement. Not wishing to disappoint, the officer arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Breaking and Entering (and Sleeping?)<br>\nMon., Sept. 15, 5:14 a.m.-A deputy was dispatched to 6661 Berkshire Terrace on a report of an intoxicated male trying to unlawfully gain entry into an apartment.</p>\n<p>When the officer arrived he contacted a resident of the apartment, who said that she had been sleeping on the living room couch when an unidentified male climbed through the front window and “passed out” on the floor. When asked if she knew the squatter, she said “no” and that she wanted him gone.</p>\n<p>The deputy walked into the apartment and saw the 21-year-old UCSB student fast asleep on the living room floor. He had on a collared shirt, a pair of underwear and nothing else. His pants were soaking wet with what no doubt was his own urine, and his shoes were laying haphazardly on the kitchen floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy shook the young man awake, but he was too disoriented to cooperate.

All around, 18 to 22-year-olds are making their way towards the ocean – specifically, toward Isla Vista’s notorious Del Playa Drive. Even a few blocks away from I.V.’s main drag, the faint buzz of speakers can be heard.</p>\n<p>But first, a cup of coffee. It’s the last Friday of summer for anyone attending Santa Barbara City College, and the sergeant and his accompanying officer know that tonight is going to be a long one.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista, UCSB’s crowded, pint-sized college town is often – and falsely – called the most densely populated neighborhood on the West Coast. Its reputation for debauchery, however, is much more quantifiable: With only approximately 10 percent of the county’s total population, I.V. accounts for roughly 20 percent of serious crimes committed – the vast majority of which are linked to alcohol use.</p>\n<p>According to Sgt. Raney, curbing the use of alcohol is at the heart of what the IVFP does.</p>\n<p>“If we can control the alcohol, we can help mitigate the serious crimes and accidents [so prominent in I.V.],” Raney says.</p>\n<p><b>Not-so-medical Marijuana</b></p>\n<p>The quick jerk of the man’s hand toward his back pocket immediately catches the attention of the patrolling officers. He might as well have just walked up and told the cops he was doing something illegal.</p>\n<p>It’s 10:55 p.m. and Sgt. Raney asks the man what he just put in his back pocket. Unfortunately for this second year SBCC student, playing dumb is not going to work. Sgt. Raney suspects it may be a bag of cocaine he stuffed into his pocket (an automatic arrest), so he places the man in handcuffs and asks him again, “What’s in your pocket?”</p>\n<p>Seeing that there is no way out, the man confesses, “A gram of marijuana.”</p>\n<p>The handcuffs are removed and he is told to sit on the curb. Sgt. Raney writes out the citation for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, a misdemeanor offense that’s going to cost the toker a little more than $100.</p>\n<p>Trying to make light of the situation, the young man tells the officers he doesn’t even have a pipe to smoke his recently purchased weed.</p>\n<p>“I just figured I’d pick that up later,” he says.</p>\n<p><b>A Captain’s Tale</b></p>\n<p>“I don’t think that’s legal,” yells a reveler socializing in front of a party on oceanside Del Playa Drive. “That’s private property!”</p>\n<p>The sheriff pays him no mind and continues down the side alley, making his way toward the balcony jutting precariously out over the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>“Even if it is private property, if it’s an open party or can be viewed from the street, we have the right to enter,” Sgt. Raney says as he passes onto the property.</p>\n<p>There, unaware of his imminent arrival, are five underage drinkers enjoying the sound of the waves and the comforting warmth of Captain Morgan’s Spiced Rum. There are not many places where college students have it so good, but with the pros come the cons.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take the officers long to determine that none of the revelers are of age. However, some insist on trying to talk their way out of it, swearing that the half-drunk beers that sit directly between their feet are not theirs.</p>\n<p>Caught red-handed, however, nobody is getting out of it. All five watch as their Minor in Possessions – the most common of citations according to Sgt. Raney – are written out and their booze is poured onto the ground.</p>\n<p>One, however, is adamant about talking his way out trouble, insisting he is a good guy and that he isn’t drunk at all. Sgt. Raney agrees he is no doubt a good guy, but keeps filling out the paperwork.</p>\n<p>With the yellow citation in hand – an approximate $150 ticket plus the cost of the drug awareness classes most opt for – the young man changes gears and tries to salvage what is left of the night.</p>\n<p>“If you were honestly cool cops, you’d let me drink that beer right now,” the 19-year-old says, referring to the nearly full forty of Miller Genuine Draft sitting at his feet. Without uttering a word, the accompanying officer picks up the beer and pours it out onto the cement.</p>\n<p><b>May I Recommend a Bush?</b></p>\n<p>There are a definite drawbacks to heavy drinking (a killer hangover, a bad decision or two, not remembering if you made a bad decision or two) but few are more prevalent – or urgent – than the need to urinate.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, you just can’t find that necessary toilet.</p>\n<p>If this is the case, a trip into one of Isla Vista’s many parks could be an (illegal) necessity, but pissing on the side of building in view of the street is never a good idea.</p>\n<p>It’s 12:50 a.m. and Sgt. Raney catches a glimpse of a man making just that mistake.</p>\n<p>Upon noticing the sheriff, he instinctively grabs his phone and makes like he was busy texting, only his phone is locked and the screen remains blank.</p>\n<p>The man is asked to sit on the curb, and while the officer is filling out the citation, a resident of the apartment comes out to vouch for the man.</p>\n<p>“He’s one of my very good friends,” she tells Sgt. Raney.</p>\n<p>“Did he have permission to pee on the side of your apartment?” Raney asks with a slight smile, but receives no answer.</p>\n<p>The man is cited for breaking a county ordinance, the lesser of two possible citations. Had he been especially rude, Raney says, he could have received the more severe penalty, which carries with it a fine of over $700.</p>\n<p><b>867-5309</b></p>\n<p>It’s 1:05 a.m. and the streets of Isla Vista are still crowded, albeit more intoxicated than a few hours earlier. Sgt. Raney and his fellow officer are standing in the shadows along Del Playa Drive, waiting for something to catch their attention.</p>\n<p>A young female, clearly intoxicated, stumbles by, holding on to a young man who doesn’t appear to be a good friend. Sgt. Raney stops the pair and asks to talk with the young lady.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney asks if she knows her male counterpart, and she tells him that they met tonight. Her accent tells him that she is not a native to Isla Vista, and he asks her where she is staying. The young Swedish woman points back and says, “the house with the dolphins on it.”</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney believes she is too drunk to take care of herself and, for her own safety, does not want to leave her with her newly acquired friend. He asks her if she has any other friends with her and she shakes her head, but offers to call them.</p>\n<p>The sheriff agrees, and she tries a few numbers without success, until finally reaching a friend. Sgt. Raney takes the phone from her, introduces himself and tells the young woman’s friend, “Come and get your friend, so she doesn’t go to jail.”</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, a gaggle of girls shows up and leads the young Swede away.</p>\n<p>“I was trying to protect an intoxicated woman strolling down the street with a random guy,” Raney says later. Had her friends not shown up, he says, he would have had to arrest her for public intoxication, which can have potentially serious ramifications and almost always includes a night in jail.</p>\n<p><b>Pending Sobriety</b></p>\n<p>The moon is sinking beneath the western horizon and the streets are starting to finally clear out. It’s nearly two in the morning and the fervor from hours past is starting to wane.</p>\n<p>Standing at the corner of DP and El Embarcadero, a number of the deputies congregate to discuss the night’s events, but none can help but notice when a highly intoxicated female stumbles out into the middle of street carrying her shoes in one hand and dropping her phone with the other.</p>\n<p>Two officers immediately make their way toward her, and watch as she attempts to pick up her phone, only to drop one of her shoes. The officers walk up to her and tell her to stop, but she brushes them off and continues walking, saying, “I’m not drinking.”</p>\n<p>One of the officers grabs her arm, and directs her to the curb. They ask her for her age and she tells them she’s 21. Her demeanor is combative, and she attempts to stand up, but is quickly reprimanded. She is asked her age again.</p>\n<p>“Twenty-four,” is her new answer. The deputy tells her she just gave two separate answers and she says, “I’m 23.”</p>\n<p>The officers stand her up and slap handcuffs on her. She continues to tell them that she’s not drunk, but her appeals fall on deaf ears. The deputies arrest her for being drunk in public.</p>\n<p>(An easy way to avoid this fate is to always walk with someone and never give the police a reason to stop you. Stumbling down the street and repeatedly dropping your belongings are dead giveaways.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the young lady acted unwisely and has to pay the consequences. After a few moments, a patrol car picks her up and transports her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she is housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/","id":3571,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3570,3569,3568],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-08-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Loitering in the Streets with Demons Sun., Aug. 2, 2:47 a.m. — Officers working the late shift received a call concerning a man loitering at the 7-Eleven convenience store on Hollister Avenue.

The man was quick to answer: “God,” he told the officer.</p>\n<p>Unfazed, the officer asked what the man was doing. “Purples fives in my eyes,” he replied.</p>\n<p>The psychedelic poet continued, uttering more strange answers when questioned. When asked his address, he mentioned a “Thermo Nuclear Device” and at one point began speaking in numbers.</p>\n<p>And when he wasn’t articulating the outlandish and bizarre, he would stand with his eyes closed and refuse to answer any questions.</p>\n<p>The officer could not detect the presence of alcohol, but judging from his weird behavior, arrested the 35-year old man for public intoxication of a controlled substance and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Angels in the Bike Rack</b><br>\n<i>Tues., July 29, 9:44 a.m. —</i> Officers on a patrol down Embarcadero Del Norte came across a young woman passed out between a pair of bikes parked in front of Freebirds.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the sidewalk sleeper and observed that she had soiled her pants and had what appeared to be dried spit and leftover food on her chin.</p>\n<p>When the officers awoke the weeknight reveler, she was extremely disoriented. She could not remember her own name and told the deputies she was at her home in Agoura Hills, Calif., some 70 miles from Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the officer was skeptical of her story, she added that she was “walking home” to Agoura Hills with her friend. When asked what friend she was walking with, the 23-year-old woman pointed towards the sky and said “him.”</p>\n<p>However, the deputy knew that not even holy providence could have steered the drunk woman home that night. Instead, he arrested and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Doggie Heaven or Just the Dog House?</b><br>\n<i>Sun., July 20, 2:43 a.m. —</i> Residents of 6744 Sabado Tarde Rd. contacted the Isla Vista Foot Patrol to report an unknown female wandering around their front yard, barefoot.</p>\n<p>When the deputies contacted the 22-year-old woman, she was unable to speak coherently or provide answers to simple questions such as her name or address.</p>\n<p>Additionally, her face was covered in what appeared to be mud, and when the officers stood a little closer, they were overwhelmed by the familiar smell of vomit and alcohol.</p>\n<p>When asked why she was in a stranger’s yard, she informed the deputies that she was trying to locate her missing dog.

Unable to conduct a stop due to traffic, the deputies followed the vehicle, which eventually made a right onto El Colegio Road and then a left onto Stadium Road.</p>\n<p>As the truck turned onto Stadium Road, the driver crossed the double yellow lines, prompting the deputies to pull him over.</p>\n<p>While standing at the driver’s side window, the officer immediately detected the pungent odor of burnt marijuana emanating from within the truck. The deputy asked if there was any pot in the car and the driver admitted that he and his passengers had hot-boxed the truck earlier that evening. He then assured the officer there wasn’t anymore weed – or at least he couldn’t remember there being anymore.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old male then produced a brightly colored pipe, complete with burnt residue. The driver told the deputies the piece belonged to his passenger, however the man riding shotgun was unable to produce a valid medical marijuana card.</p>\n<p>The driver was then asked to step out of the truck while an officer checked the vehicle for any hidden drugs. Unfortunately for this stoner, the floor beneath the passenger seat just wasn’t a good hiding spot and, after a short search, the deputy produced a small baggie containing less than an ounce of weed.</p>\n<p>The red-eyed Rasta was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of a controlled substance and was required to pee into a cup. He was later released into the care of his sober passenger, pending a later court date.</p>\n<p>Brown-Bagging It<br>\nTues., May 27, 4:28 p.m. – Officers on an afternoon patrol received a complaint of an intoxicated subject disturbing pedestrians in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, deputies spotted a 47-year-old male staggering about the park, yelling at an innocent bystander. As if his actions – and his breath – weren’t tips enough, the belligerent day-drinker was also toting a 40-shaped brown paper bag.</p>\n<p>The officer told the man to take a seat, but before obliging, the drunkard poured out his beer and tossed the bottle behind him. Dutifully, the deputy went to fetch the litter.</p>\n<p>The officer placed the bottle back in front of the elderly drunk, only to have him pick it up and throw it once more.</p>\n<p>Deciding it was best to just leave the bottle as is, the deputy asked the man – whose eyes were bloodshot and watering – how much alcohol he had consumed. The man yelled back, “I don’t care. Take me to jail.”</p>\n<p>The deputy didn’t have to be told twice. He arrested the man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/","id":3872,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3871,3870,3869],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., May 18, 12:05 a.m. - Officers on a routine patrol down El Embarcadero spotted a rather young-looking male pestering passersby as he moved down the street.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Mama Always Said…<br>\nSun., May 18, 12:05 a.m. – Officers on a routine patrol down El Embarcadero spotted a rather young-looking male pestering passersby as he moved down the street.</p>\n<p>The young man was rudely using both middle fingers to flip off those who passed, as if one “fuck you” wasn’t enough for the citizens of Isla Vista. Despite his slight build and young face, he seemed to be highly confrontational and looked to be itching for a fight.</p>\n<p>Before he could find that perfect someone, though, he ran into I.V.’s finest. The officers asked the pugnacious punk his age and he truthfully replied that he was 15.</p>\n<p>The officers saw that the 15-year old kid, who was in town visiting his brother, was carrying a backpack and asked him what was in it. He told them, “It’s just water in there. You can search it if you want.”</p>\n<p>The officers, not wanting to refuse an invitation, opened the bag and found an open, nearly empty fifth of Taaka Vodka.</p>\n<p>Upon seeing the deputy remove the alcohol from his backpack, the young gun quickly retorted, saying “Hey! How’d that get in my backpack? I was only carrying water. They must have put that vodka in there.”</p>\n<p>Not caring to get to the bottom of this case, the officers cited the young whippersnapper with a minor in possession, as well as being out past curfew, and released him to his brother, pending harsher punishment from his mother.</p>\n<p>Shrubbery Showdown<br>\nFri., May 16, 12:18 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Pasado Road witnessed a man ungracefully weaving in and out of foot traffic.</p>\n<p>So intoxicated was the young man that many of his fellow Friday night revelers stopped and watched him as he attempted to walk down the street.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he also drew the gaze of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, who stopped the unsteady stroller.</p>\n<p>A deputy advised the 18-year-old male that he was very intoxicated and told the tipsy trotter that he wanted a word with him. The intoxicated male attempted to say something in return, but his words were completely incoherent.</p>\n<p>The officer sat the tongue-tied man on the curb, but he immediately fell backwards into a rather large bush. Sitting back up, the drunkard attempted to say his name but once again could not be understood.</p>\n<p>Fearing words wouldn’t get them any farther, the deputy asked if the man had ID. The drunk managed to answer “no.”</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked the man if he could walk home, and received a “yes” in return. Yet when he attempted to stand up, gravity won the battle and the drunk found himself back in the bushes – and into a pair of handcuffs.</p>\n<p>While awaiting his trip to the jail at the IVFP substation, the man had more issues sitting, this time mistaking a trashcan for a chair. Luckily he was too drunk to be embarrassed, and was eventually transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Two Cups, One Hangover<br>\nSat., May 17, 5:19 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to the 6500 block of Cordoba Road on reports of a subject trying to gain entrance to an apartment complex.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived on the scene a few minutes later and went around to the back of the apartment complex, where they found the 19-year-old perpetrator hunched over a large puddle of his own vomit.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the defeated reveler where he was and he answered by saying his last name aloud. His answer was the same when asked where he was from.</p>\n<p>Hoping for a different answer, the deputies asked him where he was once more, and he incorrectly told them “Del Playa.” Not a bad guess, they conceded.</p>\n<p>Next on the list of questions was his date of birth, which the drunkard told the officers was “six, six.” The deputy then asked how much alcohol he had consumed and he said, “two cups.”</p>\n<p>Comfortable with their decision, the officers arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16908\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16908\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/","id":3752,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3751,3750,3749],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Trail Needs Dusting: A Nexus Goodbye","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I've learned a lot of things in the past four years and many of them I learned while working at one of the best damned college papers in the state.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I’ve learned a lot of things in the past four years and many of them I learned while working at one of the best damned college papers in the state. So, rather than boring you with my philosophies on life and journalism, I’ve decided to share with you all at least a few of those things:</p>\n<p>1) Parents of incoming freshmen are really, really nervous. Oh, and sex columns scare the crap out of them.<br>\n2) Albino raccoons are invading Isla Vista. When good ol’ Albert Raccoon bit the dust last year, we thought we had seen the last of El Blanco, but we were wrong. Dead wrong. Okay, not dead wrong. At any rate, I’m taking credit for naming the celebrated I.V. mascot since I dubbed him Albert in our April Fool’s issue many moons ago. Deal with it, Facebook.<br>\n3) Associated Students elections are fierce and scary. Sometimes when I log on GOLD at night, I can still hear the screaming…<br>\n4) The Daily Nexus is the best place to work on campus.</p>\n<p>We’ve had quite the year, gang. The Daily Nexus got a front-page makeover, feature stories and a science page; our Web site got ads, videos and comment boards; UCTV made a documentary about us; we had some amazing news coverage – hello, does Hillary Clinton ring a bell? – and we took home several awards, including the honor of being named one of the top three college newspapers in the state. Oh yeah, and we stopped two subpoenas.

I could not have done it without you. Additionally, I could not have done it without the awesome training of former editors Kaitlin Pike and Jason La.</p>\n<p>So without further delay, here is a list of my immense thanks to you all:</p>\n<p>Dianne Jobson: You have been everything I could have hoped for and more. You are the glue that holds the Nexus together. I know everyone in the office loves you, but I love you more. It’ll be weird not to work together anymore, but I’m glad that we’ll still be very close next year. I look forward to our next adventure.</p>\n<p>Sabrina Ricci: Dammit, kid, get a watch! Oh, who am I kidding. I can’t stay mad at you. You’ve done some great work with the layout this year and, holy cow, you revived the science section! Kudos, my friend.</p>\n<p>Lauren Crecelius: You are one of the most reliable people in the office. It’s been a relief to have you on the team. You are not only a fantastic editor, but a true friend.</p>\n<p>Travis Miller and Evan Wagstaff: T-Mills, you’ll always be in my heart and on my desktop, and Evan, you have a beautiful voice. Both of you have really pulled through this year and I thank you kindly. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Aria Miran: I can’t believe you are hanging around I.V. for another year. I’m warning freshmen parents about you. Seriously, though, you have led your news desk to glory this year and we’ve had some awesome times together. I have no regrets.</p>\n<p>Jessica Mullen and Mackenzie Weinger: You write some amazing and well-researched stories and it’s always fun to watch you get excited. I am so very proud of you two and I will miss you both. Give ’em hell.</p>\n<p>Erin Currie: I thought we fired you! Ok, ok. You can keep your job. Erin, I think it’s fair to say that you are one of the nicest and most humble persons in this office. Please, don’t change!</p>\n<p>Patty Bobek and C.K. Hickey : You always come into work with a smile on your faces and you’ve handled some difficult situations with the opinion page this past year. Patty, you’ve truly encouraged me to always do more and, C.K., I suspect you are Superman, but I guess I’ll never know … I put Kryptonite in your hookah.</p>\n<p>Chris Hoffman and Alex Pavlovic: If there’s anything I’ll remember, it’s Chris’s mischievous grin and Alex’s sly-guy wit. You have rocked the world of sports this year and your columns kick ass. Call me when you make it to ESPN.</p>\n<p>Mollie Vandor and Tyler Vickers: The woman who takes shit from no one and the nicest guy in the office. You two are truly a force to be reckoned with. You guys know what you want and you take it.</p>\n<p>Erin Saldana and Rickey Mizuno: Where’s Erin? I can’t find Erin? Oh, there she is. As our pint-sized photographer you took some beautiful shots this year, and Rickey, you were always there for us when we needed you. You also make a damn fine drink. With that, I leave you with Erin’s favorite word: Chupacabra.</p>\n<p>Simon Estrada and Rick Martinez: You are so damned talented. Every time I find a piece of art I like in the paper, it usually tends to be yours, and I like the way you push your artists to excel. I see great things in your future.</p>\n<p>Valerie Tidwell, Melissa Davis, Noel Woodward, Rachel Lorencz, Virginia Yapp, and the rest of Copy: I regret that I do not have enough space to give thanks to each and every one of you. Please know that your willingness to endure some of those late nights has always left me in awe of you all.</p>\n<p>Kelly O’Halloran and Kera Zacuto: You guys made On the Menu the best section it could possibly be. Never has this section looked so beautiful. I thank you very much for you hard work.</p>\n<p>Nicki Arnold: You are too cool and I was lucky to have you by my side when I was opinion editor. I’m so glad you came back this year. You are the little sister I always wish I had.</p>\n<p>Nikki Moore, Craig Calkins and Dana Olsen: You guys may have left your desks a little early, but you never left my mind. It’s been fun growing up with you at the Nexus and I hope to run into you again post-graduation.</p>\n<p>Dan Gruen, Ryan Moll, Steve Placial: Video guys! You have helped make our vision a reality. You have formed the basis of what will likely become an integral part of the Web site. Thank you so much!</p>\n<p>Barb MacLean and J.E.

By the time the officers had arrived, he had disappeared.</p>\n<p>The friend told the deputies he had allowed the man inside the apartment but that, once inside, his drunken friend started to verbally abuse his girlfriend and needed to be kicked out. It was at this point that he jumped the fence and started his assault on the sliding glass door.</p>\n<p>After avoiding the police, the man resumed his quest at the front door, prompting his friend to call the police a second time. When the deputies arrived, they heard the desperate man shouting, “Come on, man. I’m going to jail. Let me in!”</p>\n<p>The officers told the man to wait until he was sober to talk to his girlfriend and that he should go straight home, lest he be arrested for public intoxication. He agreed, telling the deputies that he would not be a problem anymore.</p>\n<p>Thinking he had given the Isla Vista Foot Patrol the slip, he returned a few minutes later to bang on the door a third time. The police met up with him in the parking lot behind the apartment and arrested him – ending his marathon of obnoxious knocking.</p>\n<p>He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Rambling Man<br>\nSat., May 3, 11:25 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive observed a man struggling to walk the line.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the 18-year-old male wove back and forth across the street, clearly intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The man then lost his balance and veered sidelong into a parked car. Unabashed, he continued on, but soon lost his balance again and fell into the next available parked car.</p>\n<p>The officers stopped the unsteady stroller, who could barely stand still without completely losing his poise.</p>\n<p>The deputies began to question him, but soon realized that along with his balance, the man had lost his ability to comprehend what was happening. He stood there with a blank expression on his face and was unable to focus on the deputy when addressed.</p>\n<p>The officer asked oblivious man where he had been headed, but when he tried to answer, his speech was nothing but a stream of incoherent ramblings. His words were horribly slurred and he could barely put together a sentence.</p>\n<p>The officers, convinced the confused wanderer was unable to get home safely, arrested him. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Marathon<br>\nSun., May 4, 2:20 p.m. – Officers taking a break in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Station on Pardall Road were interrupted by the loud remarks of two passersby.</p>\n<p>A 19-year old male and his friend walking eastbound down Pardall Road decided to tempt fate by loudly making snide remarks about Isla Vista’s finest as they passed the open door of the police station. Only, this pair of day drinkers made one glaringly obvious mistake: One of them had decided to drunkenly taunt the police with a red cup in his hand.</p>\n<p>The deputies, however, opted not to stop the pair and let them continue on their way, red cup and all.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for them, these two Sunday partiers apparently hadn’t gotten enough thrills on their first pass, because 20 minutes later they returned walking in the opposite direction – the red cup still firmly in hand.</p>\n<p>If the deputies still had reservations about stopping the two, they were wiped away when they heard their now incoherent remarks drift in through the open door.</p>\n<p>An officer stopped the cup-wielding man and asked him what it contained. The defeated daredevil confessed that he was carrying vodka and that he was only 19 years of age.</p>\n<p>When asked when he had begun his daytime drinking, the man proudly stated that he had been continuously drinking since the night before.</p>\n<p>Apparently unimpressed, the deputy arrested the man and had him transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/","id":3874,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3873,3872,3871],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Judge Joseph Lodge — 1932-2008","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In his almost 50 years on the bench in Santa Barbara County, Judge Joseph Lodge had a reputation that preceded him.

Seasoned trial lawyers and fresh faces out of law school knew that with a gavel in hand, the UCSB criminal justice professor was intelligent, probing and unpredictable all at once. His courtroom was his domain.</p>\n<p>After presiding over thousands of cases, the judge’s friends and co-workers – both in and out of the legal profession – are certain of one thing: The honorable Joe Lodge was absolutely committed to the ideals of his profession.</p>\n<p>“He tried very hard to bring justice to a coarse, harsh system,” said Benjamin Bycel, a prominent criminal attorney tapped to teach the remainder of Lodge’s criminal justice class at UCSB. “Joe tried to bring humanity and ethics into it. He wasn’t successful all the time and he was criticized for it, but his desire to consider the uniqueness of every case was well-respected.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When Lodge pulled into Santa Barbara in the late fifties things were different, Chief Assistant District Attorney Pat McKinley said. In Goleta and the surrounding area, the law was handed down through a Justice Court that met maybe two times a week – and judges did not even have to be lawyers.</p>\n<p>In 1958, the Goleta-Hope Ranch Justice Court judge was no lawyer. Senior Deputy District Attorney and friend Darryl Perlin said Lodge, fresh out of law school, decided to take a chance and give the incumbent a run for his money.</p>\n<p>“Joe Lodge, who knew very few people, did something which today is considered standard operating procedure in political campaigns, but back in 1958 it was unheard of,” Perlin said. “He decided that he would walk the precincts and introduce himself.”</p>\n<p>Lodge won the seat narrowly and never got up from the bench. Over the next half century, Lodge presided over his court in spite of severe back pain and a ten-year battle with lymphoma.</p>\n<p>“Judge Lodge could have retired 30 years ago at full salary but he didn’t,” Perlin said. “The reason was because of his love of the law and the job he did every day. He never missed work.”</p>\n<p>“You never knew exactly what to expect from him on the bench and I believe that’s exactly the way he wanted it,” William Makler, a defense attorney and former public defender, said</p>\n<p>Senior Deputy District Attorney Joyce Dudley said she first met the judge when she was just 19 years old. Lodge had ruled on a ticket she received for having an unleashed dog and she recalled how he told her to “sit” when she stood up out of place. The judge, she said, was sensitive and inquisitive but stood firm by his opinions.</p>\n<p>“He was a force,” Dudley said. “The man embraced life, embraced philosophy, embraced the law, embraced justice, and he was never interested in winning any popularity contests in terms of his rulings.”</p>\n<p>McKinley said that it is a known fact that plenty of lawyers disagreed with Lodge and that it was not easy to foresee his rulings.</p>\n<p>“He was unpredictable – unpredictable for both sides,” McKinley said.</p>\n<p>However, according to McKinley and Perlin, Lodge’s unpredictability was proof that he shot from the hip – and the fact that attorneys in court rarely moved to disqualify him is just the “proof in the pudding.”</p>\n<p>In 2002, a gala party was thrown for Lodge at the Montecito Country Club. The affair was, as his wife Sheila put it, “in lieu of” a retirement party. She said the judge was not about to step down from the bench.</p>\n<p>Perlin said it was also thrown because “it was not thought that he had much longer to live.”</p>\n<p>At the time, Lodge had been living with lymphoma for four years, McKinley said.</p>\n<p>“He handled [lymphoma] with a dignity and an openness that is rare in today’s day and age,” McKinley said. “He never really expressed fear of it. He beat back the cancer three or four times.”</p>\n<p>Perlin said that throughout Lodge’s battle with cancer, he continued to serve as a judge and professor.</p>\n<p>“Many a time, he would go for a cancer treatment in the morning and as soon as he had received it, he would be back on the bench as though nothing had happened,” Perlin said.</p>\n<p>According to Perlin, Lodge was a judge who would not quit, as he even out-lived his “memorial” party by six years.</p>\n<p>“It’s not often someone gets to come to their going-away party,” Perlin said. “But Joe Lodge didn’t go away.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16729\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16729\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/","id":3566,"author":{"id":345,"name":"David Ferry"},"related":[3565,3564,3563],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":156,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
