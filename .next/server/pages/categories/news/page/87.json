class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>It is UC Santa Barbara tradition for students to fling tortillas onto the field after a goal during home soccer games, a custom that will undoubtedly continue into Saturday’s match against rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>In the immediate aftermath of Saturday’s game, though, students might also expect to see a UCSB library employee on the field collecting the tortillas as she has done at every home game for almost a decade.</p>\n<p>Margaret Rankin describes herself as someone who has been reducing, reusing and recycling “before those words were ever known.” She recalls going to a soccer game at Harder Stadium about seven years ago and seeing the field laden with several hundred pounds of tortillas.</p>\n<p>She naturally began to question their fate and soon learned that field staff disposed of them in the landfill dumpster.</p>\n<p>“It was such a waste; to just send them to the landfill is just appalling,” she said. “I thought, ‘If they’re going to continue this, then let’s do something about it that’s actually helpful.’”</p>\n<p>The librarian first asked UCSB Athletics if she might take the tortillas to add to her own backyard compost operation. She later decided to collect the tortillas for on-campus composting.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Recycling (ASR) partnered with her shortly after and supplied designated tortilla bins for her to wheel over to their on-campus composting facility just a couple hundred feet from the stadium.</p>\n<p>According to Sarah Siedschlag, the A.S. environmental programs advisor and former ASR program coordinator, the A.S. Department of Public Worms, formerly a part of ASR, had been composting the tortillas in their worm bins when she came in as coordinator in fall 2012.</p>\n<p>The mass of tortillas proved “too much for the worms,” she said, and so the program opted to have the tortillas industrially composted off-campus in fall 2013.</p>\n<p>Tortilla-flinging began in 1995 during an ESPN-televised basketball game against DePaul University when the student section threw tortillas on the court after the first basket. The tradition was adopted for soccer matches about a decade later.</p>\n<p>The flying tortillas were especially problematic during basketball games; officials whistle any object thrown onto the court as an automatic technical foul for the home team, giving a free throw to the opposing team. Known as the “tortilla technical” in the 1990s, the tradition once cost UCSB three technical fouls in a close game against Pacific University in 1997, prompting former head coach Jerry Pimm to take a microphone and plead that audience members act more like adults.</p>\n<p>To avoid such outcomes, UCSB Athletics does not allow tortilla-throwing at basketball games or soccer games.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB Athletics currently has a “quick response plan” in place whereby field staff retrieve the tortillas almost as soon as they land on the field. The staff then bag the tortillas and leave them on the sidelines for Rankin to collect later.</p>\n<p>Rankin is not allowed on the field during the game, she said, but the exclusive pass granted to her by UCSB Athletics allows her to gather the tortillas in the moments following the game’s conclusion. She said her pass reads that she is the “Director of Phylum Annelida” (Annelida is the phylum to categorize segmented worms, which are used for composting).</p>\n<p>Rankin said she has found students to be quite “inventive” as to how far across the field they can fling tortillas. Frozen tortillas typically go further because of their rigidness, she said, as do thick tortillas and baked tortillas.</p>\n<p>Tortilla-throwing is “a good release” for students, Rankin said, but she doesn’t want to encourage it.</p>\n<p>“I just try to get a better solution to what could have been wasted,” Rankin said.</p>\n<p>In her years collecting tortillas, Rankin said she has hardly received thanks for what she does. This is fine, she said, because her work is completely voluntary, and she aims to keep a low profile.</p>\n<p>“At least I make millions happy, which just so happen to be worms,” she said.</p><div

Barbara.</p>\n<p>Katherine Kepski, the leader of the protest, encountered a woman outside her home on Sept. 16 who was being verbally abused by her boyfriend. The woman had allegedly been sexually assaulted by the man’s best friend while unconscious, and Kepski attempted to assist her.</p>\n<p>The event featured a representative of the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, members of the Student Activist Network and various members of UCSB fraternities and sororities.</p>\n<p>Numbering over a hundred strong at the beginning of the event, the protest began at the Pardall Center with a speech by a Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center advocate. She asked, “What can we do to make our streets feel safer?” and called on students to intervene, remain vocal and share their stories.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Students are marching through Isla Vista to 67 Sabado Tarde Road in protest of rape culture at UC Santa Barbara. <a href=\"https://t.co/baB1lX2HYa\">https://t.co/baB1lX2HYa</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/LL5gSpD6Yv\">pic.twitter.com/LL5gSpD6Yv</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus (@dailynexus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/787149677334441984\">October 15, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The congregation marched through the streets of I.V. starting on Pardall Road, rounding the loop past 7-Eleven and continuing through Del Playa Road.</p>\n<p>Partygoers on Del Playa issued a mixed response to the protesters, as some fervently joined in from their backyard chanting “2, 4, 6, 8, stop the violence, stop the rape” or “hey hey, ho ho, the patriarchy has got to go,” while others tepidly mocked the display, adding unrelated quips about party culture.</p>\n<p>Regardless, all eyes on Del Playa were locked on the protest, with phones up documenting a crowd which grew to over 150 protesters of mixed gender, identity and race.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73219\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2134225290\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73214\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73219\" data-attachment-id=\"73219\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/feminasty-guardians-protest-against-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/fem-rally-by-oliver-zuniga-online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"fem-rally-by-oliver-zuniga-online-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73219\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=350%2C525\" alt=\"Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73219\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Orchid Divine, third year UCSB student, hoists a sign in support of survivors of sexual assault.

id=\"caption-attachment-73212\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of NYU Tandon School of Engineering</em></p></div>\n<p>A group of hackers from UC Santa Barbara is one of the top teams to advance in a cyber security contest that began with 18,000 undergraduate students from around the world.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering hosted a 48-hour cyber security contest on Sept. 16 known as Capture The Flag (CTF), and UCSB’s team, Shellphish, came out in the top ten of all United States teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group is comprised of Andrew Dutcher, Caitlin Scarberry and Brandon Dutcher. Originally a brainchild of UCSB Hacking Team, Shellphish was founded by UCSB professor Giovanni Vigna and is one of the oldest continually active CTF teams in existence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve always been super into computers and started programming them around the age of 12 just making games and stuff,” Andrew Dutcher said of his start in hacking. Andrew Dutcher and his friends attended a hacking competition at Carnegie Mellon University during their junior year of high school, and he said, “we ended up winning, somehow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yan Shoshitaishvili, a senior member of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shellphish and a computer science graduate student, had similar beginnings in hacking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been working with computers since I was eight, but got pulled into actual hacking in high school by hacking around with my friends,” he said. “I went to the DEFCON computer security conference held in Las Vegas every summer and was completely hooked after that.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In CTF, students perform numerous challenges to test their cyber security skills. Easier challenges can take as little as 10 minutes, while more difficult tasks can take up to 18 hours.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CTF events occur all over the world every weekend, but Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) is the largest student-run cyber security event in the nation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSAW features six competitions, keynote presentations, workshops and an industry fair. Students range across all different ages and experience levels from high school students to doctoral candidates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the seemingly daunting task of 48 hours of competition to solve intense cyber security challenges, the common sentiment among both organizers and participants of CSAW is that it’s a fun event for people interested in cyber security.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“CTF is really just a puzzle game for security professionals to practice their skills in a controlled and fun environment,” Andrew Dutcher said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To expand the reach of the competition to gain worldwide impact, CSAW this year partnered with NYU Abu Dhabi and the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasir Memon, professor of computer science and engineering at NYU, founded the competition 13 years ago when cyber security was still a burgeoning field of work. He said that, today, young minds are needed to address the vulnerabilities in rapidly expanding technology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think security is an interesting discipline, because it’s more than just technology,” Memon said. “It’s a psychological problem, a business problem, a policy problem, a legal problem. We need to have the right minds in the discipline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, there have been over one million cybersecurity job openings just this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While expansion of these skills may be key to finding work in the increasingly competitive job market, for the members of Shellphish, it’s just a fun way to hang out with friends while learning about hacking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christopher Thompson, third-year computer science major at NYU with a specialty in cyber security, is the lead organizer for the Capture The Flag event. He said it is “extremely important” for people to know that cyber security programs such as CSAW are making an effort.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Going through this competition is the equivalent to earning a degree in computer security; having the CSAW name behind a person gives them a lot of validity,” Thompson said. “We’re trying to get companies to realize the talent that’s available while also giving people something to challenge themselves and have fun with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 15 teams which have outlasted preliminary competitions will advance to finals in New York from Nov. 10-12. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about Shellphish’s shot at winning CTF finals, Andrew Dutcher said they were “almost zero” due to the graduation of much of the original team.

Less than 30 officers are expected to patrol on Sunday and Monday, he said.</p>\n<p>UCPD will be sourcing officers from seven different University of California campuses to supplement its staff. Officers from Los Angeles, Irvine, UC San Diego, San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Riverside will arrive at UCSB on Oct. 27 to attend a one-day training prior to Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nearly 100 UCPD officers were present in I.V. last year, Signa said, but this year “there’s a better understanding within the whole community, this idea of trying to keep it safe, keep it local.” He said initiatives like UC Isla Vista Volunteering Program have been “fantastic” at drawing students away from parties and toward local events.</p>\n<p>Although the department hopes to gradually decrease police presence by higher increments, “we’re always kind of nervous about what’s going to happen,” Signa said. UCPD can call on the Santa Barbara Police Department and additional UC officers in the case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>IVFP, an offshoot of the Santa Barbara County Police Department, plans to post approximately 100 officers in I.V. on Friday and Saturday, 50 officers on Sunday and 75 on Monday, according to IVFP Sergeant Chris Gotschall.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73145\" style=\"width: 466px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73145\" data-attachment-id=\"73145\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/policestats/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"357,181\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"policestats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=250%2C127&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73145\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?resize=456%2C200\" alt=\"Icon courtesy of Symbolon; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus\" width=\"456\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=456%2C200 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=456%2C200 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73145\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Icon courtesy of Symbolon, Noun Project; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The department came to the decision after coordinating with both UCPD and UCSB administration. “Based on how much quieter Halloween was last year, they determined that they could actually decrease their coverage.” Gotschall said.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that this is a good sign; that things are more manageable in Isla Vista and on campus and the need for the presence of police officers is less,” Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said.</p>\n<p>IVFP officers arrested less than 30 people during Halloween weekend last year, down from over 100 in years prior, and crime is expected to stay low this year. The department currently has no plans to bring horses into I.V. as mounted patrol units, but Gotschall said this could change in case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want unsafe parties, we don’t want people coming in from all over to cause mischief,” he said.</p>\n<p>Because Halloween falls on a Monday this year, less activity is expected on Halloween Day. Gotschall said approximately 188 officers were patrolling I.V. on both weekend days in 2011, the last time Halloween was on a Monday.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, external vice president of local affairs, plans to continue alternative programming from last year. Businesses in the Downtown District participating in “Haunt the Loop” will share candy with trick-or-treaters, and volunteers will pass out water bottles to partygoers at “hydration stations” throughout Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board hosted Snoop Dogg for a sold-out concert on Halloween last year, and this year’s headliner will be announced in the three weeks leading up to Oct. 31.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73144\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73144\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/","id":4647,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4646,4645,4644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings-On in I.V.

The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, and Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p><strong>IVRPD</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 13, in the IVRPD building next to the I.V.

The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>Debate</strong><br>\nThe Nexus, KCSB and The Bottom Line will co-host a debate between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann, the candidates for Third District County Supervisor. The debate will be Thursday, Oct. 13 at I.V. Theater starting at 6:30 p.m. The debate will also air live on 91.9 FM KCSB.</p>\n<p><strong>Memorial Garden</strong><br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting at 2 p.m. on Friday to upkeep the Isla Vista Love &amp; Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was built in May 2015 to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014 shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Concert in the Park</strong><br>\nThe UCSB Community Housing Office, the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU) and IVRPD are co-hosting a Kick-Off Community Concert on Friday in Anisq’Oyo’ Park (966 Embarcadero Del Mar) from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. The event is for residents to interact with their property providers while listening to live music from local bands Mellow Grass, The Real Savage Henry and The Nitwits. Landlords, managers and owners from over 25 property providers will be at the event. There will also be a photo booth, succulent planting and prize giveaways.</p>\n<p><strong>Vegan</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. on Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>Free Food</strong><br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, IVTU and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday, Oct. 19, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students. This food giveaway is regularly held every Wednesday.</p>\n<p><strong>Voters</strong><br>\nCommunity volunteers are currently working to register 13,000 voters in Isla Vista and at UCSB. In years past, UCSB has been one of the top universities in terms of registering voters with as many as 11,000 voters. This year, volunteers hope to set a new record by registering thousands more for the November election. The last day to register is Oct. 24.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The fee will be used to partially fund a Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista to improve infrastructure, provide tenant-landlord mediation and institute community policing, among other services.</p>\n<p>According to Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the legislation outlining the Isla Vista CSD, the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) sets the rate at which the CSD may levy its UUT. LAFCO approved an eighth percent UUT in April.</p>\n<p>Along with several other I.V. stakeholders, Chuck Eckert, an Isla Vista property provider, assembled Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes in September to build opposition toward the measure to approve the UUT, which requires a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>One of Eckert’s main objections to the measure, he said, is its potential to increase the cost of living for I.V. renters. Not only will renters have to pay the taxes for their own utilities, he said, but any tax paid by landlords will be added to renting costs.</p>\n<p>Eckert said he and many other I.V. property providers oppose higher rent because such price hikes will make their units less “attractive,” prompting renters to look elsewhere for housing.</p>\n<p>In a radio show with KCSB 91.9 FM in August, Yes on E&amp;F campaign organizer Jonathan Abboud said each person will pay between $5 to $10 per month for the UUT — “about half a Freebirds burrito once a month.”</p>\n<p>Although unable to provide numbers during an interview with the Nexus, Eckert said he anticipates much higher costs as a result of a UUT.</p>\n<p>“It’s certainly going to be more than half a burrito,” he said.</p>\n<p>Eckert said the CSD will be ineffective in providing services to Isla Vista residents. Half of the funds raised by the tax will fund “bureaucracy,” he said.</p>\n<p>Citing a financial feasibility study organized by The Fund for Santa Barbara in Sept. 2015, Eckert said there will be an annual $512,000 revenue from the UUT. About half of that amount, $257,000, will go toward management and administration of the CSD, leaving $255,000 for other services.</p>\n<p>This, however, is not the only proposed means of funding CSD services. UC Santa Barbara has pledged an annual $200,000 to the CSD for seven years.</p>\n<p>Eckert also disapproves of Measure F because he finds it to be unfair; UCSB can have representation in the CSD board of directors despite not paying the UUT. According to AB 3, UCSB shall appoint one member to the CSD board of directors, yet, as the financial feasibility study reports, all utility consumption on UCSB land would be exempt from a new UUT.</p>\n<p>Despite starting a campaign against Measure F, Eckert has not come out in opposition to Measure E, the ballot measure to create the CSD in Isla Vista. As he put it, “one could be neutral on Measure E and still oppose Measure F.”</p>\n<p>But according to Darcel Elliott, the campaign manager for Yes on E&amp;F, opposition to Measure F is still opposition to Measure E. Disapproving of the means to fund the CSD, she said, will not allow the CSD to provide all of its enumerated functions.</p>\n<p>“You can’t have E without F,” she said.</p>\n<p>One might say that the fate of the CSD ultimately rests on the approval of a UUT at some point. AB 3 enumerates that, if voters do not approve the UUT before Jan. 1, 2023, the CSD shall be dissolved as of that date.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

He says that students are more likely to trust emails from these “legitimate” accounts. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The email, sent by Sam Horowitz, the chief information security officer at UCSB, gave tips for keeping student information secure, such as how to spot phishing attempts, suspicious URLs and Trojan horse attachments.</p>\n<p>Horowitz said this latest phishing campaign was made possible by “a few relatively narrow campaigns targeted at staff” in the summer. The attack originated when a compromised U-Mail account sought to collect additional usernames and passwords in the last week of September.</p>\n<p>According to Horowitz, users are more likely to trust the compromised account when it is a real UCSB email account. The result is “a continuous loop:” one account gets phished and that account is used to phish others.</p>\n<p>As a result, it becomes difficult to track or prevent phishing attacks when they are actually sourced from legitimate accounts.</p>\n<p>At that point, students would have to call or visit the Collaborate Student Support Center to have a necessary password reset on their account. According to Horowitz, there’s no way to tell how many people responded to the attacks, but he can confirm that it was “more than a rare occurrence.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the message came too late for Ashley de Leon, a first-year film and media studies major, whose account was locked when it became a victim to phishing.</p>\n<p>De Leon explains that she received a high number of illicit emails informing her that her inbox was too full and that she needed to sign in to upgrade her storage. At first, she responded by clearing out her inbox, but after repeated pestering, she finally submitted her information.</p>\n<p>“I first noticed something was wrong when the window disappeared after I put in my information,” she said. “Then things started getting really wrong about a day later when I was receiving emails from Microsoft saying that my emails weren’t sending. I hadn’t sent any emails, and it was like 50 of these coming in.”</p>\n<p>The U-Mail system was blocking a large number of the outgoing emails that the phishers were using her account to send, but it’s still unknown how many were actually successfully sent.</p>\n<p>“First I changed my password … and it worked, but then the next day I got entirely locked out of the whole system,” de Leon said.</p>\n<p>After receiving help from the I.T. department, de Leon was finally able to recover her account, and it is no longer being used for phishing attacks.</p>\n<p>NCSAM “emphasizes proper cyber security practices through webinars, posters, YouTube videos, social media outreach and on-campus presentations,” Matt Hall, the chief information officer at UCSB, said. Fittingly, the first two weeks of NCSAM focus directly on topics of phishing — email and otherwise.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73142\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73142\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/","id":2458,"author":{"id":106,"name":"Josh Bevan"},"related":[2457,2456,2455],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Arbor’s Tarot Card Reader Buckingham Reads Fortunes, Gives Advice","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-13-at-9.45.35-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-13-at-9.45.35-PM.png?resize=586%2C374&ssl=1","description":"Near the corner of the Arbor’s bustling walkway, a small camp-like setup can be seen next to Larry Calvaletto’s “Got Questions?” booth.

Advertised with a piece of cardboard inked with the words “Tarot Reading,” the curious setup is gathered around a man in dark clothing reading a student’s fortune.</p>\n<p>Dan Buckingham, a 26-year-old Tarot card reader from Michigan, has settled down on campus after three years of travelling. He has been visiting the Arbor Monday through Fridays the past five weeks.</p>\n<p>According to Buckingham, his primary goal is not to make money; he charges no “fixed rate” and asks only for donations if students are willing. Rather, he said he does Tarot reading to offer guidance to lost students.</p>\n<p>“I do it to help people; to give guidance and counsel to those who are just sort of wanting some clarity or wanting advice from somebody,” he said. “And past that, it’s a way to bring up certain topics or uncomfortable discussions that are otherwise inaccessible other than through a medium like Tarot or something like that.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham has been doing Tarot readings for almost a year-and-a-half, receiving generally positive feedback from his clients.</p>\n<p>“Before the reading, they’re normally curious,” Buckingham said. “The majority of them have never done this before, so they generally go to it with some expectation but don’t really know what’s going to happen. Afterwards, they’re generally pleased, surprised at the accuracy and overall happy with the outcome.”</p>\n<p>The basic idea behind a Tarot reading is simple — the querent (the one receiving the fortune) picks an instructed amount of cards from a shuffled 78-card deck. The reader then lays out the chosen cards in a spread — that is a shape or pattern — that consists of different meanings depending on where the card is placed.</p>\n<p>The Tarot reader (Buckingham, in this case) then interprets how the meaning of the card corresponds to the position it is in, and he gives a description or advice to the client what the spread seems to be saying about their current life situation.</p>\n<p>Although Buckingham’s primary goal is to help those who are lost, there are some people he does not read for.</p>\n<p>“I almost never read for people who are intoxicated,” Buckingham said. “Also, if I have a suspicion that somebody won’t be appreciative or won’t take it seriously, then I will immediately turn them away because I don’t want to waste my energy and time to help somebody who is not going to use it.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham’s biggest concern involves contemporary society, and the direction it is headed if it doesn’t change.</p>\n<p>“I sort of see that the way humans conduct themselves — with themselves as well as the rest of the world — is in a manner that is unsustainable and cannot be maintained for any much longer. And so this includes a whole host of systems we have in place and the ways we do business,” Buckingham said. “If this is not somehow overturned or stopped or changed, then very serious irreversible repercussions will result, and so that’s of concern to me.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham specifically chose to do his readings on a university campus because students are “kind of figuring out who they are,” during a very important “transformation” in their lives.</p>\n<p>“So I really feel like the world is in a position where that age group and that kind of potential is really necessary to address, and they really are the ticket to the solution.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham’s biggest advice to UCSB students is to not worry too much, including about knowledge, material wealth, a degree or a job.</p>\n<p>“I think in one way everyone is already enlightened, or is in complete connection with everything and that there is no religion or doctrine or thing that one needs to pursue or experience to get that,” he said. “In the end, I just want to empower them; urge them to think about things.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

students expressed themselves in spoken word on Monday at the annual “Coming Out Monologues,” sharing their experiences aloud to usher in National Coming Out Day on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>For approximately eight years, the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) has organized the event as a safe space for students.</p>\n<p>The MultiCultural Center Theater was a full house Monday, with people struggling to find a place to sit, or even stand, so that they could find a view of the stage.</p>\n<p>Manny Jimenez, the show’s coordinator, began the night by introducing the event format. The first hour was allotted for scheduled performers, and the second hour opened up the stage for all interested performers.</p>\n<p>The poets were from diverse backgrounds, and each one talked about different topics while on stage. Jimenez was the first to take the stage. He started off his performance by placing a rug on the floor alongside some candles, creating an altar. He performed a skit with spoken word integrated to it, prompting resounding applause from the audience.</p>\n<p>The rest of the performers introduced themselves by first name only, focusing attention on their poems. Ariel and Emma sat on stage and told their stories, and Andrew used the time on stage to speak about his mental health.</p>\n<p>Ezra told a story about being partially closeted, admitting that he was out to his friends and people at school but not to his family. He noted that many people speak about the benefits of coming out, but also offered advice for those who fear the process.</p>\n<p>“It’s okay to be closeted; coming out is your choice,” Ezra said.</p>\n<p>In Yessica Ramirez’ performance, she talked about her struggles with coming out in addition to being a Mexican immigrant.</p>\n<p>The final planned performance was from Kyle. Kyle took the time to first tell the audience how he had moved away from his parents and was homeless for most of high school. He also recited a poem called, “A Love That’s Not a Choice,” which prompted rounds of loud applause from audience members.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stein was then introduced by Ben Manski, a Green Party member since 1990 who was Stein’s campaign manager for her 2012 presidential bid.</p>\n<p>Stein began by speaking about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would run through the land of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota. Contamination from the pipeline, she said, would be environmentally and culturally disastrous for the indigenous people.</p>\n<p>She added that a warrant is out for her arrest following her involvement in the protest at Standing Rock, prompting applause from a crowd of approximately 100 people.</p>\n<p>She focused mostly on environmental issues and the importance of voting for “the greater good, not the lesser of two evils,” and she frequently alluded to both the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates.</p>\n<p>Stein was well received by the moderately sized audience and several individuals frequently chanted Stein’s name and applauded for her speaking points.</p>\n<p>Commenting on Stein’s policy earlier this week in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>, Green Party Spokesman Mike Feinstein said it would be useless for Californians to vote Democratic in this election, given the state’s history of voting for Democratic leaders.</p>\n<p>“It’s a wasted vote if you’re a progressive and you’re voting for Hillary Clinton. You’re not gaining anything by doing that, on a policy basis,” Feinstein said.</p>\n<p>Per Hoel, a 32-year-old freelance videographer and local activist who attended the rally, was skeptical of her choice to focus primarily on the environment and other big ticket issues without delving fully into the issues with the two-party system.</p>\n<p>“I found the speech kind of underwhelming,” the rally attendee said. “I was expecting a reason to vote for her, not the things that I wanted to hear.”</p>\n<p>Mariah Clegg, a first-year sociology graduate student also in attendance at the rally, said she was undecided on whether to vote for the Green Party candidate and expressed that at the moment she did not know what was best for the movement.</p>\n<p>“It’s important that progressives don’t split along this line of people who are voting for the lesser of two evils and people who are doing the righteous thing,” Clegg said.</p>\n<p>Because Stein could not be on stage with Democrat and Republican presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Sunday,  she live-streamed answers for the presidential debate at <a

offering new bites and the same laid-back vibes Isla Vistans have come to love since its inception.</p>\n<p>The event was organized by A.S. Program Board and offered free food from Woodstock’s Pizza, C’est Cheese, China Pavilion at Chapala and Kyle’s Kitchen. It also featured performances by local musicians Choice, Kaysin and The Real Savage Henry.</p>\n<p>The slogan of the festival was “your fees, your fest,” and Christina Chiocchi of the Program Board emphasized the group’s goal to address student hunger. The need for food can be “so real” in college, she said.</p>\n<p>Students also need safe spaces without alcohol and to see that there is “more than just the party scene” in I.V. said Program Board commissioner Bo Wolfe. He said an event like First Friday is especially important for first-year students who are still finding their footing in the community.</p>\n<p>Although community volunteers have organized the event in the past, several UCSB clubs, including A.S. Program Board, hope to host it in the future. Though each organization approaches First Fridays differently, they all plan art, lights and a substance free area for students to relax and socialize.</p>\n<p>Since the first event in October of 2014 with a turnout of around 70 people, it has grown to feature fire jugglers, a palm reader, food trucks and a snow machine from the UCSB Excursion Club during the holidays.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72994\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1841787309\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72996\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72994\" data-attachment-id=\"72994\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-09/first-friday-offers-free-food-laid-back-vibes/ivff-by-christina-demarzo-10072016-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?fit=1325%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1325,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ivff-by-christina-demarzo-10072016-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?fit=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72994\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?resize=250%2C377\" alt=\"Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?w=1325&amp;ssl=1 1325w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1159&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?resize=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 678w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72994\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The turnout steadily increased as word spread and student organizations began to sponsor the event, driving attendance up to 500 students per event.</p>\n<p>The idea of First Fridays emerged two years ago, after the May 23, 2014 Isla Vista shooting. Kim Yasuda, a professor in the Department of Art, started a class called I.V. OpenLab to create projects for the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>Organized by student volunteers from Yasuda’s class with support from Chancellor Yang, senior campus organizations advisor Viviana Marsano, I.V. Drip, Sorriso Italiano and Shave It, First Fridays were born.</p>\n<p>The events were not only for students, but for families and other residents who came together to strengthen the community. The first event was held in People’s Park, next to the Love and Remembrance Garden, a place described by the I.V.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Sept. 28 a bill that eliminates the statute of limitations for rape and related offenses.</p>\n<p>The Justice for Victims Act (Senate Bill 813), authored by Sen. Connie M. Levya, ensures an indefinite time limit for the prosecution of sex offenses such as rape.</p>\n<p>Previous California legislation required rape cases to be prosecuted within ten years of the alleged crime, unless new DNA evidence surfaced after the ten-year limit. This ten-year time limit is known as a statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>Levya said the bill will allow victims to pursue justice whenever they feel ready to come forward, as victims often take time to process trauma and gather courage before approaching law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Survivors of sexual assault should always have the ability to seek justice in a court of law, even years after the alleged crime was committed,” Levya said in a press statement. The bill, Levya said, will “help to ensure that rapists and sexual predators are not able to evade justice simply because of a shortened statute of limitations.”</p>\n<p>The bill is linked to the sexual assault allegations against comedian Bill Cosby, who has been accused of committing a variety of sex offense by over 60 women.</p>\n<p>Several of Cosby’s alleged victims testified in favor of the bill at legislative hearings and press conferences.</p>\n<p>Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Cosby’s accusers, said that California’s statute of limitations prevented her clients from having their cases heard.</p>\n<p>“It was too late for California prosecutors to file a case even if they concluded that they had sufficient evidence to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt,” Allred said of Cosby’s alleged victims in a press statement. “Even though it was too late for these accusers, we decided that we should work to change the law to help others.”</p>\n<p>For many anti-rape advocates, the bill is an important milestone; it was signed just four weeks after the early release of Stanford swimmer Brock Turner, who was convicted on three counts of sexual assault, and is one of several bills introduced in the California legislature addressing rape and sexual assault.</p>\n<p>However, the elimination of the statute of limitations has raised concerns as well. Charles Anderson, law professor at UCLA School of Law and former criminal defense practitioner, said that eliminating the statute of limitations could lead to a wider margin of error when prosecuting rape cases over ten years after the alleged crimes.</p>\n<p>“The more that time passes, the greater the likelihood an unjust outcome may be reached,” Anderson said in an email.</p>\n<p>“There is an increased danger that a person who reports being a sexual assault victim after so many years may have a distorted memory of the event.”</p>\n<p>Such “unjust outcomes” may include wrongful convictions of rape, as was the case with former football player Brian Banks. Banks served five years in prison before it was found that the alleged victim had fabricated her story and Banks’s conviction was overturned.</p>\n<p>Despite these potential consequences, the Justice for Victims Act was passed with bipartisan support as Cosby’s allegations became a hot-button issue. According to Anderson, the bill “would not be happening right now if it were not for the Cosby case.”</p>\n<p>However, Cosby and other alleged sexual offenders will not be tried for cases whose statutes of limitations are already expired. The Justice for Victims Act will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2017 and does not apply retroactively.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of

election; Patterson performed poetry and spoke on black history. <em>Soham Tikekar / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Renowned minds in art and academia flew into Santa Barbara this week to discuss the concept of civility in the face of hatred and violence at UCSB Student Affairs’ newest series.</p>\n<p>Award-winning spoken word artist Sunni Patterson and David Kim, the department chair of racial and religious studies at Connecticut College, were invited to UCSB by George Lipsitz, a professor of sociology and black studies.</p>\n<p>A Tuesday night event was held at the St. George Family Youth Center in Isla Vista, featuring only Patterson, and a Wednesday night event included both Patterson and Kim.</p>\n<p>Kim said he accepted Lipsitz’s request because Lipsitz felt there was a “brokenness” to the culture of the campus.</p>\n<p>“There were incidents on the campus where racism and xenophobia were affecting the first-generation students,” Kim said. “We wanted to set a theme for the year about how might love be a way for the culture to heal itself.”</p>\n<p>Their goal was to promote conversation and help inspire creative work, in addition to “letting seeds grow,” Patterson said.</p>\n<p>The Wednesday event was held in the Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall in panel form. Lipsitz, as the host, asked questions while Patterson and Kim answered. The room was packed with students and visitors alike.</p>\n<p>“Love-driven politics” was Kim’s main theme. He talked about the resilience of love in the face of hate and power struggles in the political scene. Using his own upbringing as an example, he started off with a word of gratitude toward the organizers of the event. He said he hoped the same sincere gratitude would be present in the political sphere.</p>\n<p>Kim also talked about the culture of hate as perpetrated by the Trump campaign and the effects of such hate, including political gridlock in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, most of Paterson’s themes focused on her phrase “Freedom is now!” Using her cultural background for context, Patterson explored the history of African Americans.</p>\n<p>She recounted her visit to Ghana in the early 2000s, where she was told of the plight of early African slaves who were stowed on ships “packed like sardines” with only the ability “to move your head or a foot.”</p>\n<p>Another anecdote she shared was her own experience with pain, loss and lack of freedom during Hurricane Katrina. As a New Orleans native, she endured the storm personally, and it was the inspiration for much of her poetry. The idea behind the phrase “Freedom is now!” she said, is that one has to seize the moment.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72919\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/guests-speak-on-love-in-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72919\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/guests-speak-on-love-in-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/guests-speak-on-love-in-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/guests-speak-on-love-in-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/guests-speak-on-love-in-politics/","id":2453,"author":{"id":105,"name":"Jack Hu"},"related":[2452,2451,2450],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Grant To Lay Framework for Digital Database","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?resize=960%2C641&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB library has received a $100,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences to create a framework that supports extensive digital library collections.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_72906\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72906\" data-attachment-id=\"72906\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/new-grant-to-lay-framework-for-digital-database/library-by-eric-swenson/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?fit=960%2C641&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,641\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library-by-eric-swenson\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72906\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Library-by-Eric-Swenson.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"The grant — which totals $100,000 — aims to begin initial proceedings for creating a framework that can support vast digital library collections.

The team began to form in November 2015, after which it took almost a year to secure the grant. Because it was his first time applying for such a grant, he said the success of the application was due to the expertise and specialization of the team, many of whom spent years researching before coming together to work on the proposal.</p>\n<p>Padilla estimates that the majority of the money will be used to support the participation of visiting researchers, bringing together a group of experts both nationally and internationally.</p>\n<p>He believes that it is crucial to have a “diverse representation of voices,” since the project is interdisciplinary.</p>\n<p>The money will be allocated toward travel and lodging costs, as well as other expenses necessary to facilitate the meetings.</p>\n<p>The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) awards the National Leadership Grants to support projects that benefit libraries through advances in research and new tools, models and services.</p>\n<p>A press release from IMLS states that out of the 85 preliminary applications that were received, 19 full proposals were invited for further review and only 15 libraries were given grants. IMLS Director Dr. Kathryn K. Matthew said that the “recipients represent the best of the best,” and all the recipients went through a rigorous peer-reviewed process.</p>\n<p>Padilla was inspired to start the project after extensive work with humanities researchers, many of whom were interested in computational analysis. The project supports those who wish to analyze or download hundreds or thousands of documents at a time, as opposed to the traditional online viewing of one document at a time.</p>\n<p>The grant will help fund an initial two-and-a-half-day conference in March or April at UCSB with approximately 30 experts including librarians, researchers, technologists, archivists and museum professionals from various universities.</p>\n<p>Their goal is to identify challenges and suggest possible ways to “prepare access to digital library collections in a way that makes them easier to use” for computational analysis, Padilla said. Questions that need to be addressed include the form the collection should be in and the type of documentation needed to create such a collection.</p>\n<p>This conference will be followed by six conventions, including one with the Digital Library Federation in the next year and a half to refine ideas proposed during the initial meeting and to push forward in the development of the frameworks.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
