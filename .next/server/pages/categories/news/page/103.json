Students were able to walk through the new paseo entrance Monday and explore 60,000 square feet and three stories of brand new space, which students hope will alleviate library traffic, especially during finals week.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Metzger, assistant university librarian for outreach and academic collaboration, said plans for the renovation had been “in the works for almost two decades,” due partially to rising enrollment.</p>\n<p>“If you have spent any time in the library, you have seen that it’s really packed with students all the time,” Metzger said. “By the time we began [construction], the library hadn’t been touched in 35 years.”</p>\n<p>The project was largely made possible by an approximately $80 million state grant, and Metzger said the library is “continuing to raise money for furnishings, technology, collections and other initiatives.”</p>\n<p>The construction appeared to be ahead of schedule in the summer, and school officials estimated the library would open earlier than expected, but the construction was completed in line with the initial timeframe.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67162\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67162\" data-attachment-id=\"67162\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/renovated-library-portions/newlibrary_eric-swenson-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1451912299\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"140\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New Library Opening\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67162\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=650%2C434\" alt=\"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Metzger said the first few students in the building Monday encountered some surprises, and she warned students to expect some kinks that will be worked out in the coming days.</p>\n<p>“There were definitely some hiccups on opening day morning,” Metzger said. “There were some alarms going off, some doors opening that shouldn’t be opening. People should be a little bit patient with coming back.”</p>\n<p>Students in the library Monday evening said they were enjoying the new library, though, and praised its new design and spaces.</p>\n<p>“I love it. It’s a shocking difference from the old library; the new spaces are so nice,” third-year political science major Cristina Hernandez said. “I use the computers in the library all the time, so having all these new options of where to do that is going to be good.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez lives on Sabado Tarde Road in Isla Vista, which she said has led her to rely on the library for a quiet study space.</p>\n<p>“I can’t study in my apartment,” Hernandez said. “I just will never get homework done there. If I want to get anything done, I’m always at the library.”</p>\n<p>The University of California system plans to enroll 5,000 additional in-state students among its nine campuses next year, and 5,000 more over the subsequent two years. Hernandez said she thought the renovations were necessary to keep up with the new students.</p>\n<p>“Within my last couple of years, I could already tell the library was getting more and more packed every year, so it definitely came at a good time,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Ian Davis works at the circulation desk and said he was enjoying his first shift in the new library.</p>\n<p>“The old space, we worked at circulation over there and it was a lot more cramped,” Davis said. “Here, we obviously have this huge area, which is pretty nice.”</p>\n<p>Davis said he was most excited for the ability to reserve study areas online, “so you don’t have to have someone in your group get there at 8 a.m. and kind of post up. You can do it on your own time which is more convenient for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major Chris Claycomb was reading a book in one of the study areas in the new library Monday evening, and said he liked being able to “kill some time” before making the commute home to downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Claycomb left UCSB after his sophomore year to study at the United States Naval Academy and is returning this year to complete his degree. He said he remembered a much busier library before the addition.</p>\n<p>“I just remember you would go to the old library and, at least during finals and midterms, you would have to wander three floors to find a room, especially if you were with a group of people,” Claycomb said.</p>\n<p>For this reason, Claycomb said he “only used the library a few times” before the addition, but thought he would “give it a shot” after seeing the addition and renovations.</p>\n<p>There will be a formal opening for the library on Jan. 13, when Chancellor Henry T. Yang will speak and A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal will announce that the senior class gift will be designated for the library, according to Metzger.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

recent RAND Corporation study found that more University of California students have been receiving mental health care following an increase in state funding for mental health services on campuses.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A recent RAND Corporation study found that more University of California students have been receiving mental health care following an increase in state funding for mental health services on campuses.</p>\n<p>California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA), a statewide mental health initiative funded by the 2004 Mental Health Services Act (Prop. 63), implemented new mental health service programs at California’s public colleges in 2010, asking the Santa Monica-based think tank RAND Corporation to conduct an evaluation of the statewide programs over the course of a year. The RAND report indicates the percentage of students accessing mental health treatment increased by about 13 percent from 2013 to 2014. UCSB’s Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) confirms an increase in the number of students it has been treating since receiving CalMHSA funding in 2011.</p>\n<p>RAND Corporation associate policy researcher and lead author of the study J. Scott Ashwood said the increase indicates more students are going to counseling services to receive necessary help.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students at UCs and other systems experience mental health disorders, and it’s also the case that most of those students don’t receive services or treatment for those mental health disorders,” Ashwood said. “We think an increase of 13 percent is a really positive increase because it means that more students are getting treatment for these conditions that they weren’t getting treatment for before.”</p>\n<p>Ashwood said there could be more than one reason campuses treated more students between 2013 and 2014 than in previous years, such as an increase in the amount of insured students due to the Affordable Care Act, but he believes CalMHSA funding for campus mental health services is the primary reason for the increase.</p>\n<p>“We’re pretty confident that some of this increase, at least — and possibly all of it — is due to CalMHSA’s investment,” Ashwood said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. director Jeanne Stanford said UCSB’s mental health services center has seen a 20 percent increase in the amount of students it serves every year since it first received CalMHSA grant funding in 2011.</p>\n<p>“I never knew what money would do for mental health services until we got the grant,” Stanford said. “It made us visible and it made mental health visible. None of that, or maybe a quarter of that, would have been done without the CalMHSA funds.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. mental health specialist Gladys Koscak, who helped decide how to spend CalMHSA grant funding, said C.A.P.S. used the state money mostly for outreach, such as the center’s #SaySomething campaign, which launched in 2012.</p>\n<p>“[The grant] gave us the opportunity to have money for outreach and marketing materials that we typically don’t have money to be able to purchase,” Koscak said. “That really helped spread the word both about our services and also about mental health in general.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. psychologist Janet Osimo, who also helped allocate CalMHSA grant funds, said the additional money allowed C.A.P.S. to develop a mobile phone app and an online interactive screening program alongside its #SaySomething campaign, which she said encouraged students to access C.A.P.S. over the past few years.</p>\n<p>“I think what the extra funding does for us is it really helps address the unspoken need out there that we’re not aware of so we can start opening our doors more,” Osimo said. “Fortunately, we’ve been able to continue that.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said she hopes the increase in the number of students that C.A.P.S. has treated since 2011 leads university policy makers to give even more funding for campus mental health services.</p>\n<p>“I hope it increases the allotment and that it increases what the universities are willing to give to student mental health,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Stanford also said she hopes to see administration designate more campus space to C.A.P.S. to meet the university’s increasing demand for mental health treatment.</p>\n<p>“You can’t just increase the numbers in the schools or build more residence halls without thinking about mental health,” Stanford said. “It’s about finding the space for mental health and wellness services on a campus and making it a policy that every campus has to increase their ability to provide services.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and sociology double major Siavash Zohoori said the RAND Corporation findings will demonstrate to the UC Board of Regents that increased funding toward campus mental health services allows universities to treat more students.</p>\n<p>“I think that the study was a necessary step that a lot of activists were waiting for so that we could prove to the Regents and the policy makers that the funding is really necessary and will be effective,” Zohoori said. “Increased funding will actually benefit students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to the plaintiff, she suffered the loss of educational opportunities after being sexually assaulted in October 2014, ultimately being forced to withdraw from the university in January 2015 due to “deliberate indifference” on the part of the university.</p>\n<p>According to the case, Moore’s cousin reported the sexual assault to the police the morning after the incident. Moore provided a statement to UCPD and went to Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) the next day to schedule a counseling session. After Moore received a session with an intern seven to 10 days later, Moore’s father contacted Marisa Huston, Assistant Coordinator of Student Mental Health Services and requested his daughter be able to promptly meet with an experienced counselor. Moore met with Huston two to three days later and was allegedly made to wait 10 minutes and told that Huston was not obligated to the keep the contents of the meeting confidential. During this counseling session, Moore expressed concern about losing her financial aid and student housing if she dropped classes and was told by Huston that these could both be potential problems.</p>\n<p>The case states Kirsten Olson, the Assistant Clinical Director and Administrative Services Coordinator called Moore three to four days after the counseling session and scheduled a meeting for a few days later.</p>\n<p>“At the meeting, Olson immediately began talking to Moore about her grades. She asked Moore if Moore had considered withdrawing from UCSB. Moore informed Olson that she did not want to withdraw. Olson responded by questioning Moore’s decision not to withdraw, and informed Moore that there were counseling measures Moore could engage in during the time she was withdrawn from UCSB,” the case states.</p>\n<p>According to the case, Moore also had a phone call with Joe O’Brien, Assistant Dean and Director of Advising at UCSB, and was told that if she reduced her course load, she would be ineligible for both financial aid and UCSB housing. Moore also made efforts to switch her counselor at C.A.R.E., but ran into several roadblocks.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, Moore received a letter from UCSB informing her of academic probation due to poor academic performance during her first quarter at UCSB. In late January, four months after first reporting her assault to UCSB, Moore withdrew from the university.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff alleges that UCSB’s Title IX coordinator was never informed of her sexual assault report and that she was not provided adequate or timely counseling from C.A.R.E. after the sexual assault. Moore’s case also claims UCSB did not take any action to investigate Moore’s report of sexual assault by another UCSB student after she expressed a desire for some “remedial action” to be taken with regard to her report. In response to this request, the university allegedly told Moore an investigation would take a long time, be difficult emotionally and distract Moore from her studies. She was also told a school investigation would likely interfere with, and possibly even sabotage, the criminal investigation of Moore’s assault.</p>\n<p>The case also states Moore encountered the perpetrator of her sexual assault at least one time on campus after the incident, causing Moore to quickly leave the area after suffering a panic attack.</p>\n<p>“The mere presence on campus, without any restrictions, of the student that sexually assaulted Moore made Moore vulnerable to additional harassment and further exposed her to a sexually hostile environment,” the case states.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also claims she was deprived of several education opportunities, including but not limited to: a drop in her GPA, withdrawal from several classes, avoidance of several social activities on campus, the need to seek multiple accommodations from UCSB and eventual withdrawal from UCSB.</p>\n<p>“As a result of Defendant Trustees’ deliberate indifference, Plaintiff suffered loss of educational opportunities and/or benefits, has incurred and will continue to incur attorney fees and costs of litigation,” the case states.</p>\n<p>UCSB and the University of California Office of the President were both unable to comment, stating the case is currently pending litigation.</p>\n<p>UCSB Public Affairs office said while they could not comment on the case, the safety and well-being of students is the university’s highest priority, and students’ cases are treated with care and confidential advocacy.</p>\n<p>“If the student chooses to formally report their assault to the University, the allegations are thoroughly investigated and adjudicated in accordance with UC policy and government guidelines. We strive to ensure that our investigative processes are survivor-centered, but we understand that not every survivor opts to formally report their assault. In all cases we continue to offer support and counseling to assault survivors, as the safety and well-being of our students is our highest priority,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div

Black Coalition, which encompasses UC’s nine Black Student Unions, revealed in November that the University held shares in private prisons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC) issued <a href=\"http://afrikanblackcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Prison-Divestmen-final-resolution.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a resolution</a> Thursday demanding that UC divest from private prisons and companies that support private prisons. Later on Thursday, a spokesperson from the UC Office of the President (UCOP) confirmed the University’s shares in private prisons, which were part of a broader portfolio, had been sold on Dec. 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCOP’s Director of Media Relations Dianne Klein said after <a href=\"http://afrikanblackcoalition.org/2015/11/30/university-of-california-has-millions-invested-in-private-prisons/\" target=\"_blank\">ABC announced in November that UC had $25 million invested in private prisons</a>, the University decided to sell its shares in the companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students brought this to our attention, and based on that, we looked at our investments in private prisons, which total less than $30 million, and we decided to sell them — they are gone,” Klein said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klein said UC does not issue statements on divestments, but does routinely review its investments, totaling $91 billion, to see if they are financially sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We see the issue of private prisons as: Is that really sustainable? Is that going to make us money in the long term? And we don’t think so for these social reasons,” Klein said. “From a risk perspective, it didn’t make sense to hold on to these assets.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB alumnus and Political Director of ABC Yoel Haile said UC’s investments in private prisons supported a system that disproportionately harms poor people and people of color.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The investments were] a practical example of how the UC system doesn’t value black lives or immigrant lives or poor lives because it is underwriting an enterprise that is systematically targeting our people,” Haile said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haile said there is a contradiction between UC’s public stance and the corporations in which it is invested financially.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the UC system is the largest public institution in the country and is investing millions of dollars into [private prisons] … the message is obviously that you support this because, even if you say rhetorically that you don’t, your money is speaking,” Haile said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haile said ABC members have been speaking with UCOP Chief Investment Officer of the Regents Jagdeep Singh Bachher since August, and are hopeful that his office continues to work with the coalition on its additional demands, which include issuing quarterly investment reports and divesting $425 million from Wells Fargo, which owns shares in private prisons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Bachher] has stated that he wants to partner with us, and we hope that he becomes a good partner in this matter,” Haile said. “We really hope that the UC does the right thing. And if it doesn’t, then it’s going to have to deal with black students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he was looking forward to discussing the issue more with students in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I appreciate the Afrikan Black Coalition and the Black Student Union bringing up this current issue, and we look forward to having more dialogue and discussion with our ABC and BSU students … at upcoming Regents meetings,” Yang said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Black Student Union Political Chair and fourth-year environmental studies major Nia Mitchell said she sees this as one step toward a larger goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re getting the ball rolling,” Mitchell said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this is just the beginning of seeing what black unity and solidarity among people of color can do for the equity of all of our people.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

In the meeting, students, long-term residents and representatives from the Santa Barbara County considered the possibility of creating an I.V. Code Enforcement Program allowing the CSD to enforce building and zoning codes in I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Deputy Director of Planning and Development Glenn Russell, the cost to expand the County’s current Code Enforcement Program would be approximately $235,000 a year, and it would cost an I.V. CSD about $20,000 to $25,000 to get the program started.</p>\n<p>“$235,000 is a reasonable estimate,” Russell said. “It could be a little bit more. It could be a little bit less.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee Jonathan Abboud said Russell’s estimate for the Code Enforcement Program is significantly larger than the $120,000 estimated in the Financial Analysis Study The Fund for Santa Barbara released in September 2015.</p>\n<p>“That sounds like a lot of money,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Russell, the current Code Enforcement Program only investigates building and zoning code violations if residents report them to the county.</p>\n<p>“What we have today is a reactive code enforcement program, both for building and zoning violations,” Russell said. “Anybody in Isla Vista who reports a building or zoning violation can have it investigated.”</p>\n<p>Russell said a “proactive” Code Enforcement Program — one where Program officials can exercise their police powers to bring residences up to code — would raise the possibility of evicting residents for zoning violations, which is the protocol for enforcing such codes.</p>\n<p>“Be careful what you wish for,” Russell said. “You have to be very judicious in how you apply these limited police powers. A proactive Code Enforcement Program would put people out of their lodging.”</p>\n<p>According to Field Representative for Assemblymember Das Williams’ office Cameron Schunk, the structure of an I.V. CSD’s Code Enforcement Program will largely depend upon the funding it receives from UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be largely contingent on what we hear from UCSB as far as what they want to contribute towards what type of program they want to see,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Schunk also said University administrators discussed the possibility of opening University housing to students the CSD’s Code Enforcement Program temporarily evicts as incentive to bring their residencies up to code.</p>\n<p>“There were talks amongst administrative officials about offering some of the University’s housing as kind of temporary assistance housing if we decided to pursue some sort of code enforcement to bring the housing stock of I.V. back up to an acceptable level,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>With this option, however, Schunk said there is a “hidden catch” that the evicted students’ landlord might decrease the number of bedrooms in the residence.</p>\n<p>“There’s no guarantee that you’re going to have a place to go back to,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>As a solution for assisting evicted residents, Abboud said he suggests the I.V. CSD create a temporary housing fund.</p>\n<p>“If the I.V. CSD did implement this, we could have a small fund to help people who got kicked out to find temporary relocation for a month until they could move back into their place once it’s up to code,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said she is concerned about the possibility of evicting I.V. residents for violating zoning codes, such as by living in a closet or a garage.</p>\n<p>“These sort of people are not living in those conditions because they want to. It is because they have no other resources,” Dela Cruz said. “I think it’s important for us to keep that in mind that there are larger reasons for why these issues are occurring in our community, and we need to think about that as well while we’re thinking about this program.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66897\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"128780311\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66919\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66897\" data-attachment-id=\"66897\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/stakeholders-discuss-code-enforcement-program/iv-stakeholders-121-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"IV Stakeholders discussing the current county coe enforcement, and what would happen if we were switched to proactive enforcement.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1448996545\",\"copyright\":\"John Clow\\/DN\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"IV Stakeholders 12\\/1\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Stakeholders 12/1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66897\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"John Clow/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66897\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to Russell, however, a Code Enforcement Program cannot ignore violations for the sake of avoiding the eviction of residents, as it must be consistent in enforcing violations.</p>\n<p>“You can’t ignore something someplace because you just feel bad,” Russell said. “You have to be absolutely consistent and even-handed.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said she hopes the CSD’s Code Enforcement Program will provide opportunities for students to get involved.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested in hearing about the students and the involvement we may have in this Code Enforcement Program,” Dela Cruz said. “This is something that I think the university is very interested in.

The pop-up store has operated since 1968 and is run entirely by artists who apply each year to have their work featured. On Dec. 3 from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. the store is hosting its annual event to mark the first Thursday of December, featuring live music, wine and appetizers and allowing customers to meet the artists.</p>\n<p>Susan Dunbar, the current manager of the store and former UCSB student, said what makes The Yes Store special is cooperation and the “legwork that nobody sees.”</p>\n<p>“For me it’s just amazing to see everybody pull together in a big group and make it happen,” Dunbar said. “‘Cause we typically only have a week or two to build the desk, get your booths in, stock it and then we open.”</p>\n<p>Dunbar, who first began working for the store after graduating college in 1981, said she appreciates watching multiple generations of Santa Barbara locals enjoy the store.</p>\n<p>“We’re unique in the way that we’ve been doing this for so long, so we see families grow up and come back and bring their children and buy art,” Dunbar said.</p>\n<p>The Yes Store employee Wendy Wagner said she tries to create a connection between shoppers and artists.</p>\n<p>“I’m a floor sales person but I consider myself an artist facilitator,” Wagner said. “I try to encourage people to know a little bit about the artists when they’re looking at their work so that that might help them purchasing their little treasures from these people.”</p>\n<p>Wagner said the store has undergone considerable expansion since last year and is always encouraging new artists to join.</p>\n<p>“We have 10 new artists this year so there’s a lot of new product in the store; we’re really excited about that,” Wagner said. “We like the expansion process, and, if any artists are interested in being in The Yes Store, we have a book that you can sign your name and then be notified next year when the jury process begins.”</p>\n<p>Long-time customer Stella Larson said she loves the quality of the store’s products, as well as being able to give back to the Santa Barbara art community.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coming at least 42 years and I always look for my favourite people and then I look for the new people; it’s a wonderful thing. It’s all local artisans, everything is handmade — it’s really wonderful quality,” Larson said. “It helps the artist and it helps keep art going in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Local resident Trina Diaz said the store is well-known in the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>“I grew up here and it’s been going on forever,” Diaz said, “Locals all know about the [The] Yes Store so they look forward to it every year.”</p>\n<p>Diaz added that the store is a great opportunity for local artists to gain more exposure.</p>\n<p>“It’s a wonderful place for local artists to display their talent and for people to come and see that from all over the world,” Diaz said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Sweater Party in the Loma Pelona Center on Monday, encouraging the spirit of the holidays with an ugly sweater contest, cookie decorating, snacks, festive music and a photo booth.</p>\n<p>The Ugly Sweater Party took place after the first day of instruction following Thanksgiving break, and on the official commencement day of “Dead Week.” R.A. of the Zaca house and second-year biochemistry major Mitine and R.A. of the Camuesa house and third-year sociology and psychology double-major Aranki invited students to don holiday attire and relax before finals.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she enjoyed watching friends gather together in Loma Pelona and decorate cookies from an ugly sweater cookie kit.</p>\n<p>“It makes you feel like you’re in kindergarten,” Mitine said. “You’re decorating cookies and people are talking and getting to know each other.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said she is excited for Christmas break because she wants to spend time with friends and family and enjoy her first Christmas in Hawaii. Mitine said organizing the event was fun because she loves Christmas and the winter season.</p>\n<p>“Decorating was fun,” Mitine said. “The holiday times are my favorite, so doing a program like this was not a problem.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Yaneli Gutierrez said her favorite part of the party was decorating cookies, which she modeled after her reindeer sweater. Gutierrez also said she attended the party because she enjoys Christmas and ugly sweaters.</p>\n<p>“The tackier the better,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Aranki said she wanted to host a fun holiday party as a “de-stresser” for her residents.</p>\n<p>“I really care about residents a lot, especially their mental well-being,” Aranki said.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she hoped the event would be a fun way to bring the residents together.</p>\n<p>“Everyone always talks about how they miss being home for the holidays,” Mitine said. “Dead Week and finals are so stressful.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said the Loma Pelona Center was chosen for the event because it is between Manzanita and San Rafael residence halls and facilitates opportunities to meet other students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just a nice way to get people out of their room or away from the library for a little bit and to all be out here together,” Mitine said.</p>\n<p>Third year biology major Heidi Lee said Christmas is one of her favorite holidays because she gets to spend time with friends and family.</p>\n<p>“I want to skip over finals and get to break,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>International student from Belgium Annelies Leenknecht said she is currently taking classes at Santa Barbara City College on a gap year.</p>\n<p>Leenknecht said she enjoyed attending the party in preparation for winter break, although she wishes she was returning to Santa Barbara in January.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could come back here afterwards,” Leenknecht said. “I have to stay home unfortunately.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Santa Catalina South Hall Community Service Chair and first-year political science major Leanna Lugo organized Winter Warm-Up to help provide blankets for the shelter during this time.</p>\n<p>Lugo said the shelter has a shortage of blankets for the estimated 100 individuals expected to arrive at the shelter in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“They suggested I host a blanket drive,” Lugo said. “I went to my advisor and talked to him about it and he said it is a great idea so I began planning it.”</p>\n<p>According to Lugo, the program was a “success” and has received 40 to 50 blankets so far.</p>\n<p>“What I’m hoping for by the end of this week is about 60 blankets, but right now I think we have a pretty good amount,” Lugo said.</p>\n<p>Lugo said she originally wanted to organize volunteering for the shelter.</p>\n<p>“I really wanted to take a group of students to help feed the homeless at Casa Esperanza because I really liked what the shelter stood for and their mission,” Lugo said. “But when I got into contact with them, they were busy because it was November. They were booked for volunteers.”</p>\n<p>Lugo said most donations came in after students returned from the Thanksgiving weekend.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think people had a lot of used blankets here but when they went home for Thanksgiving break, they seemed to have brought back a lot since then,” Lugo said. “On Monday I started to see a lot of blankets in the boxes. Some people even brought clothes.”</p>\n<p>Santa Catalina South Hall Multimedia Coordinator and first-year communication major Carmen Ma said the values associated with Thanksgiving may have prompted students to donate blankets.</p>\n<p>“People start to remember what they’re thankful for and they start wanting to give back because they realize all that they have.” Ma said.</p>\n<p>Ma said it was easy to get students to participate.</p>\n<p>“All people had to do was bring back blankets over break,” Ma said. “It’s a win-win for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Santa Catalina South Hall Council Environmental Awareness Chair and first-year psychology major Nina Masjedi said she donated to the drive.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a great way to help people and see a direct result on a local scale,” Masjedi said in an email. “It was a way for me to help in the community surrounding me.”</p>\n<p>Lugo said the program provided people an easy opportunity to help the local community.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure that everyone who attends this school also had to do some sort of community service, so it’s important to keep that going even though you’re already in college.” Lugo said. “It’s important to give back to the community and give to those that need it more than we do.”</p>\n<p>Lugo said the program can set a precedent for future years.</p>\n<p>“This sort of event is a good thing to continue,” Lugo said. “Even if a homeless shelter doesn’t have a shortage of blankets or if they have enough of what they need.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/winter-warm-up-to-collect-blanket-donations/","id":2609,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2608,2607,2606],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Share Childhood Stories about Santa","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SANTA-.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SANTA-.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For many of us, the holiday season comes with disappointments in the form of finals, failed classes and freezing temperatures as low as 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

But each year the holiday season brings a much more severe disappointment to children around the world: the realization that Santa Claus isn’t real.</p>\n<p>We all have our own story of discovery, and the <em>Nexus </em>asked five UC Santa Barbara students to share the moment they discovered the magical man was, in fact, a legend.</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Sam Lewis said he was sick and home from school one day when his mom sat him down, holding an article about Saint Nicholas to show he was real at some point.</p>\n<p>“Then she said, ‘Even though [Santa Claus] is gone, his spirit still lives on through Christmas, and now you’re part of the knowing club because Santa Claus doesn’t really exist — we’re Santa Claus,’” Lewis said. “‘Your brother isn’t part of the club, so don’t tell him. When he’s about your age, we’ll tell him as well.’ And so for the next couple of years, I was in the know and I thought I was in this cool, exclusive club.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Varshini Satish said she was eager to catch Santa Claus one year with her dad. The two of them camped out by the fireplace on Christmas Eve with baseball bats and a garbage bag to catch Santa.</p>\n<p>“I tried to stay awake as long as I could, but I eventually fell asleep,” Satish said. “At some point I woke up when I heard a movement. My dad told me he had gone to get a glass of water, but I saw presents under the tree and I looked at the handwriting on them and it all clicked in my brain.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Camila Holm’s parents were not ready to tell her the truth about Santa Claus when her aunt spoiled the secret one year.</p>\n<p>“My mom always had special wrapping paper and special tags for Santa to use and then when my aunt came to visit, she mixed them up,” Holm said. “So then Santa and my aunt had the same wrapping paper and when I asked my mom about it, I found out.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Travis Kim discovered the sad reality when he supposedly misread the calendar one year.</p>\n<p>“Santa came on [December] 24th . . . I asked my mom why and she said, ‘Everyone makes mistakes — even Santa,’” Kim said. “But Santa never makes mistakes . . . that’s when I knew.”</p>\n<p>For some, like first-year biology major Sunaina Kongara, the illusion of Santa Claus and his reindeer never existed.</p>\n<p>“I never believed in Santa because my dad was too lazy,” Kongara said. “He wouldn’t even wait until we fell asleep to put presents under the tree or eat all the cookies.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 in the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/","id":2602,"author":{"id":140,"name":"Olivia Pla"},"related":[2601,2600,2599],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Editor in Chief Sends His Wishes This Holiday","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It’s been a tough year.

Not just for the students here at UCSB, but for the entire world. There are millions of people fleeing from a country torn apart by violence; Paris, Beirut and countries all across Africa and the Middle East have been the victims of terrorist attacks; there have been more mass shootings in the U.S. than there have been days; the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>With so much anger, hatred and violence in the world, it’s so easy to fall into fear. But that’s exactly the point of terrorism … to make us feel scared. Because, when humans feel scared, it’s a scientifically proven fact that creativity, empathy, generosity, intelligence, performance and pretty much all higher functioning decreases. We become animals of instinct and reaction, rather than beings of intellect and creation.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66923\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1379591936\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66922\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66923\" data-attachment-id=\"66923\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/emile/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"emile\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66923\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile-1024x576.jpg?resize=700%2C394\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66923\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It’s no revelation that everybody is affected by terrorism, whether it’s through the pain of losing a loved one, pain of being scared of attacks on ourselves or pain for humanity as a whole, we all feel it. But the problem is that we have begun to let that dictate how we feel everything. Everyday function is marred by the possibility of danger, so we keep our heads low and try to make sure we have enough just in case, trusting that everybody else will do the same — it’s not our responsibility how anyone else lives, right?</p>\n<p>Wrong. Humans are intrinsically wired for empathy, that’s why we have these things called mirror neurons. If we watch something happen, our brains light up as if it were happening to us. Our nature is to survive, yes, but our nature is also to care.</p>\n<p>I’m not trying to say that we all should walk around feeling guilty that we’re not sponsoring a refugee or anything like that — quite the opposite. I’m saying that everybody can help just by fighting back against the terror that is slowly creeping into our brains. It’s as easy as a smile. Next time you’re walking or biking around, keep a smile on your face. You’d be amazed at how many people smile back.</p>\n<p>Whenever you feel that inclination toward withdrawing into your shell, remember that is not your nature. That is somebody trying to manipulate you into silence, into complacency, into fear. You don’t have to accept the negativity that is being fed to you every day.</p>\n<p>I don’t mean to say you should ignore it at all; you need to see it, to observe it, to understand it. You need to process it in your own way. But then you learn and move on. You need to remember that you can play for one of two teams: fear or peace.</p>\n<p>If you feed your fear, what do you think you’ll notice everyday? Things that make you scared. You’ll live under a layer of doubt, uncertainty and selfishness. You’ll make choices based on what is best to annul your current fear without thinking about the long-term. That’s not an opinion, that’s science. Fear demands short-term rewards.</p>\n<p>So a piece of advice for this holiday season, and forever, is to choose to be confident, to be brave, to be happy for all the small victories and gifts in your life, to be peaceful and welcoming when you can and to handle yourself like you matter, because you do. You never know how far a smile can go. The more you look for the positive things in this world, the more you’ll find them and, chances are, the more you’ll create them.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, just remember that today you are not a victim, and that means you have the power to change things. You don’t need to be a Senator to enact change. Nothing ever stays the same. So ask yourself, are you making the world a happier or darker place today? You have the power to do both, and whether you like it or not, you’re doing one of them.</p>\n<p>Go out and enjoy this holiday season, even with all the tragedy. Enjoy it extra just to show the world that you won’t listen when they try to spook you. Enjoy it extra just because you can.

The holiday is only celebrated in a handful of locations including the United States, Canada, Norfolk Island, Puerto Rico and Liberia.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> spoke to international students and those studying abroad at UCSB to see how their Thanksgiving experiences compared to the images they had of the holiday.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Alice Lomas is from Devon, England, and said she had an idealized image of Thanksgiving from American media.</p>\n<p>“I had seen [Thanksgiving] in all the American films, and I thought it was a massive family gathering with a turkey and a traditional Sunday roast experience, similar to what our Christmas is like,” Lomas said.</p>\n<p>While Lomas said she cooked and spent the holiday with friends, she said it was lacking because family is what makes the tradition special.</p>\n<p>“It kind of lived up to the expectations, but because we didn’t have our own family there, it was not the same,” Lomas said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Cæcilie Køhler is from Copenhagen, Denmark, and said she understood Thanksgiving after watching television shows and movies portraying the American tradition, which she added is similar to a Danish Christmas.</p>\n<p>“It’s like this in Denmark during Christmas. Some people even eat so much that they have to go to the hospital,” Køhler said, laughing.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Xiaoyu Li from Beijing, China, compared his Thanksgiving experience in the U.S. to festivals in China because of Black Friday sales.</p>\n<p>“In China, there isn’t Thanksgiving, but there is a festival there that all the shops celebrate . . . It’s like a Black Friday sale,” Li said.</p>\n<p>Li said while he ate turkey and went Black Friday shopping during his first year at UCSB, this year he decided to spend it with friends making traditional Chinese food.</p>\n<p>“I went to Big Bear with a group of students and ate hot pot [an East Asian stew],” Li said.</p>\n<p>Second-year mathematical science major Omicron Wang from Chongqing, China, likened Thanksgiving to Spring Festival, known as Chinese New Year.</p>\n<p>“This is a time where every member of the family comes together,” Wang said. “We regard Thanksgiving in the U.S. as a regular holiday.”</p>\n<p>Second-year financial mathematics major Jennifer Sun from the Shandong province of China said although the food and traditions may be different, the values of the Chinese New Year and American Thanksgiving are similar.</p>\n<p>“When the Chinese New Year comes, we renew together and make traditional food like dumplings, just like people in the U.S. make traditional food and spend it with family,” Sun said.</p>\n<p>Second-year statistics major Shiwei Hua from Wuhan, China, said American Thanksgiving is similar to the Lunar Festival in China in some ways, but differs in others.</p>\n<p>“The Lunar Festival is when everywhere from the family gets together and eats traditional foods,” Hua said. “It’s a time for family to get together. I thought there would be many people in the street because during Lunar New Year we have games and puzzles all in the street.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of location or name, holidays provide an opportunity to celebrate one’s culture with the people, food and traditions that are important to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/","id":2599,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2598,2597,2596],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Combine Cultures in Thanksgiving Traditions","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Thanksgiving has been a tradition in the Americas since 1621 when Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag Indians shared a meal to celebrate the autumn harvest.

With many UCSB students coming from an immigrant background, often with relatives who had never heard of Thanksgiving prior coming to the United States, their Thanksgivings reflect a diverse cultural background.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> spoke with students who immigrated or have parents who immigrated to the U.S. to learn how they integrate their families’ traditions with those of the customary Thanksgiving practices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year mathematics major Alejandro Stawsky said when his parents first migrated to the U.S. from Uruguay, they didn’t originally celebrate Thanksgiving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we first came here, they had no idea what Thanksgiving was,” Stawsky said. “I would go to school and then I would come back home and ask, ‘Are we doing Thanksgiving?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stawsky said his family now mixes Thanksgiving traditions with its Jewish background by celebrating a Shabbat dinner, the Jewish Sabbath meal, on the Friday after Thanksgiving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During Shabbat, we incorporate Thanksgiving,” Stawsky said. “We make tortas de papa, bourekas, baba ghanoush and go around the table saying what we’re thankful for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year global studies and political science double major Kajol Raju said her Punjabi family spends Thanksgiving at her grandparents’ house with a meal of traditional Indian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have turkey, and my aunt makes a ham and mashed potatoes, and then my aunts or grandma will make Indian food like curry chicken or tandoori chicken, and we’ll have sweets like gulab jamun.” Raju said. “After, we throw on an Indian movie and dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year anthropology and art history double major Diana Torres Luevanos said for her Mexican family, the phrase “vamos a comer,” which means “let’s eat,” signifies Thanksgiving.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first arrived to the States, I didn’t really celebrate Thanksgiving how everyone did,” Torres Luevanos said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Torres Luevanos said today, though, Thanksgiving is an important family tradition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We now get together every year in our church and have a whole ceremony on giving thanks,” Torres Luevanos said. “Then we eat tamales, arroz, frijoles and a bunch of Mexican food; sometimes my sister even makes fresas con crema, which is strawberries and cream.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year mathematics major Armin Mahini said he and his Iranian parents combine typical Thanksgiving dinner with Persian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Typically we have tahdig, which is a crispy rice dish, but there’s also American food,” Mahini said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year biochemistry major Allysa Foot’s mother is Vietnamese and her father is Honduran. Foot said Thanksgiving is her favorite holiday because it is one of the few occasions in which her family can “appreciate the differences” and celebrate the “beauty” behind the different cultures involved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My mom’s side of the family will make seafood like crawfish and crab or clams and oysters … and my dad’s side of the family makes tamales or enchiladas,” Foot said. “They truly give thanks this way by being able to come together and embrace one another and their differences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foot said Thanksgiving reminds her of being “enveloped in a blanket.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re enveloped in this total complete warmth, and it’s comforting, and it’s safe and it’s beautiful,” Foot said. “It’s home.

in the Isla Vista Clinic building to discuss which services should be the first to receive funding if I.V. becomes a Community Service District (CSD) in the Nov. 2016 county elections.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday’s meeting was the fifth of 11 meetings the Initiate organized for community members to discuss the framework and specific services that may be offered in a CSD. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the meeting, the group of about 15 attendees made provisional plans to spend $119,000 out of the $255,000 they expect to have after the CSD’s administration costs.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The CSD’s budget for funding services would come from revenue from a Utility User Tax (UUT), as stipulated in Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group tentatively decided to ask the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to approve the following budget: $50,000 for hiring a grant writer, $30,000 to begin developing a new parking program, $25,000 for a tenant-landlord mediation program, $8,000 for a Municipal Advisory Council (M.A.C.) and $6,000 to remove graffiti, possibly by painting murals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy CEO of Santa Barbara County Martin Erickson said forming a CSD in I.V. through AB 3 might lead to more cooperation between the university, county and I.V. governance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think part of AB 3’s existence is going to have the County and UCSB look at this area differently and [result in] more partnerships,” Erickson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Organizer for Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said although the CSD will have a relatively small budget, it will be able to make significant improvements in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing about the CSD is it’s going to do things and those things are going to have an impact on Isla Vista,” Elliott said. “These things are not going to cost very much, but they’re going to do a lot for the community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elliott said the group’s tentative planning served an important purpose, even though it did not result in an official budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not just all out here running around like crazy … we are figuring it out now, we do have plans already in process; we are ready for governance; we can do this,” Elliott said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB professor of economics Lanny Ebenstein said spending $50,000 on a grant writer would be a good decision because it could yield a positive return.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems like a very good idea because that’s a position that could generate several times its cost,” Ebenstein said.</span></p>\n<div

held its first meeting to discuss social justice and civil rights at the Goleta Valley Conference Room last Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SPLC is a national organization focusing on a three-pronged strategy to tackle racial and social injustice by fighting hate, teaching tolerance and finding justice. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB club will seek to meet these objectives through educational initiatives, advocacy and collaboration with existing groups which share similar concerns.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The club’s specific plans are to have police sensitivity training, create a coalition with other activist groups and host a “Know Your Rights” event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SPLC Advisor and UCSB professor of classics Rose MacLean said the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> goals of the club are to combat hate, promote positive change, and protect civil rights by focusing on the legal details.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is essential that members of the community know their rights and have access to quality legal advice and representation,” MacLean said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club President third-year environmental studies and French double major Sebastianne Kent said the university needs clubs that fight hate groups, and that she encourages students to get involved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “It doesn’t take your whole life and all of your time to do something that’s going to change peoples’ lives,” Kent said. “It just takes you deciding that’s what you want to do and finding other people who feel the same way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kent said she feels SPLC differs from other activist groups because it advocates for anyone treated poorly because of their race, gender, identity or religion instead of focusing on a specific demographic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are a lot of activist groups here that do amazing work, but SPLC has a history of advocating for everybody who is a victim of discrimination,” Kent said. “I think not only is that important, for everybody to feel like they have a safe space, but for them to feel like they have some kind of information about how to take action.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club Secretary General and third-year sociology major Sanjukta Koppolu said she appreciates the club’s inclusive mentality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important because you have to realize that in an environment like a college campus, you are part of a community, so I think everyone is obligated to help each other out,” Koppolu said. “It shouldn’t be just women dealing with sexism or people of color dealing with racism. It should be everyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club Vice President and third-year English and psychology double major Caterina Lazzara, said she is interested in the club’s focus on legal rights.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to get involved here and make policy changes that would prevent these injustices from happening in the future,” Lazzara said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

(IRS) after filing IRS Form 990 for three consecutive years, having failed to do so for 12 years prior.</p>\n<p>IRS Form 990 is a tax form for tax-exempt organizations which outlines organization activities and finances. By law, the University of California is exempt from filing an IRS Form 990 because it is recognized as a government affiliated organization under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 115 and IRC 501(c)(3). The IRS is currently deciding whether Associated Students is exempt from filing IRS Form 990 based on its affiliation with the UC.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal said the current A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez addressed the IRS non-compliance issue by hiring lawyers to work with A.S. after she was hired in 2008.</p>\n<p>“From 2008 to 2012, that’s when we were in contact with lawyers,” Villarreal said. “Not just UC lawyers but we also brought in outside lawyers just to try to figure out where we were. We contacted the general counselor for the UC, so with their advice, we went to another lawyer who specializes in IRS matters.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) contacted her about the IRS non-compliance issue.</p>\n<p>“I had been working here in my office and UCOP called me up one day asking me why we haven’t been<strong> s</strong>ubmitting our own 990 document for the prior 12 years,” Marquez said. “I researched it and I found out the reason; prior to that there had been an understanding that turned out to be a misunderstanding.”</p>\n<p>According to Villarreal, A.S. did not file the form for 12 years due to confusion about the relationship between the UCen and UC.</p>\n<p>“The reason why we weren’t filing before that was because at the time, we shared the same track ID number with the UCen because technically we are in UCen property,” Villarreal said. “Because the University files for the UCen, the UCen thought the [University was] filing for Associated Students. But they were not.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said it is difficult to categorize the tax status of A.S because it follows policies from UC Regents, A.S. Legal Code and regulations as a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“The mix-up occurred because we are both a department for the campus and system, and we also hold our own tax ID number,” Marquez said. “Students wanting to be independent from the university have maintained both levels of responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said A.S. is working with lawyers to research whether A.S. should be recognized as a UC-affiliated organization.</p>\n<p>“We’re not even sure if we have to file 990s and that is still something we’re still trying to figure out with our lawyers because we’re under a governmental entity which is the University of California,” Villarreal said. “So even now we’re still working on exactly figuring out if this is something we have to do.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said because A.S. has an unclear affiliation with the UC, he does not know whether A.S. will incur penalties from the IRS.</p>\n<p>“It is a possibility that there could be fines incurred, but I’m not really sure how much,” Villarreal said. “But we have the funds that we can use for that and we can take care of it if need be. I don’t expect that to happen, but it could.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Louis Mariano said the IRS compliance issues are mostly “small technical things” that must be fixed to maintain a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“IRS issues have been present in the Association for the past few years and it is an issue that the A.S Executive Director has been dealing with, informing the president and senate with updates,” Mariano said in an email.</p>\n<p>Mariano said it is unlikely the student body will be affected by the A.S.’s non-compliance with the IRS as long as A.S. continues to communicate with the IRS.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I believe that there isn’t much impact for the student body and student fees as long as the issue is being dealt with, which the Executive Director has been doing as mentioned before,” Mariano said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66758\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66758\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/","id":2593,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2592,2591,2590],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":103,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
