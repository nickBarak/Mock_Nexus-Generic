One editor suggested they print the article that was written by a woman because “women never get published in literary magazines.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83871\" style=\"width: 754px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83871\" data-attachment-id=\"83871\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/img_0679/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0679.jpg?fit=744%2C903&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"744,903\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0679\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0679.jpg?fit=206%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0679.jpg?fit=744%2C903&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83871\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0679.jpg?resize=744%2C903\" alt=\"\" width=\"744\" height=\"903\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0679.jpg?w=744&amp;ssl=1 744w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0679.jpg?resize=206%2C250&amp;ssl=1 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83871\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Hannah Ford-Monroe</em></p></div>\n<p>“[That comment] got me thinking how a lot of times in magazines and media in general, that straight white-abled bodied heterosexual men tend to be prioritized unconsciously and consciously throughout society,” Woo said.</p>\n<p>Woo, along with a team of eight other second-year students, then decided to create a literary space of their own where students of all genders, races and sexualities could be equally represented.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to make a space and a platform for people who don’t live by those labels to showcase their art and creativity in a way that uplifts them and lets them speak for themselves,” Woo said.</p>\n<p>The publication will be called “Um…” Magazine because it represents the “psychological fillers” used by marginalized groups as they speak to others as to not come across as “aggressive,” “rude” or “harsh,” according to the magazine’s Gofundme page.</p>\n<p>The magazine will start out as a website that will feature content such as photography, videography, art and literary pieces. Each featured category will also have its own sub-section such as poetry, prose, drawings, paintings and sculptures, Woo said.</p>\n<p>“Um…” Magazine’s editorial team hopes to have print editions of their content by Winter Quarter 2019, according to Woo.</p>\n<p>While the magazine does plan on having consistent writers on their team, Woo said the majority of the content they wish to include will be submitted by students themselves, which will hopefully showcase students’ own personal struggles and stories.</p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to submit content will be allowed to do so, according to Woo.</p>\n<p>“The magazine would prioritize [marginalized] people… but won’t exclude anyone who wanted to submit content,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We hope to give voices to those [marginalized] groups and opinions that don’t see as much light without feeling it necessary to censor or change what they have to say regardless of who’s listening,” the magazine’s Gofundme page states.</p>\n<p>Woo’s hope is that the magazine will turn into a community rather than just a publication. They will hold fundraisers and social events, such as open mic nights, throughout the year to get more students involved and interested.</p>\n<p>A goal for the magazine is to be able to hand out their publications for free, so more people can read their content.</p>\n<p>“I think opening up people’s eyes to new perspectives will help them practice more than just tolerance… they’ll practice acceptance and to support those who don’t fit into a very one-sided perspective,” Woo said.</p>\n<p>The magazine has its own Instagram page that will keep students updated on the progress of the publication process. They have also asked students to submit their own content, which is already being featured on the page.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83855\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83855\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/","id":2222,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2221,2220,2219],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Abortion Pill In Public Universities One Step Closer to Becoming Law","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-08-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Student-Health-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.18.2014-01.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Student-Health-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.18.2014-01.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The bill would require all University of California and California State University campuses to offer the pills by Jan. 1, 2022, including UCSB.

<p>Police arrested a 20-year-old for cocaine possession, among other charges, in Isla Vista Saturday morning, during which a deputy “pulled out his service weapon,” according to police.</p>\n<p>The individual, Kole Yamashiro, was removed from his vehicle around 7:15 a.m. after deputies from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) observed said vehicle blocking a driveway on the 6600 block of Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>After approaching, deputies removed Yamashiro from the car and called medical officials for an unresponsive female companion who appeared to be suffering from an opioid overdose, according to Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Both were determined to be under the influence of a controlled substance, while Yamashiro was found in possession of cocaine and Xanax.</p>\n<p>A deputy then pulled his service weapon when Yamashiro “did not comply with the deputy’s commands regarding reaching into his pocket,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Manuel, a 22-year-old I.V. resident who asked that his last name not be used, initially posted on Facebook after he witnessed the incident.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Nexus, he said the police had been called because the vehicle was blocking the entrance to his driveway.</p>\n<p>Manuel said he saw no sign of resistance during Yamashiro’s arrest and that the officer had taken “aggressive action.”</p>\n<p>According to Manuel, a police officer “pull[ed] out his gun” and “threatened to shoot [Yamashiro] while he was on the ground.”</p>\n<p>“The male was not armed, was clearly confused to what was happening because he was woken up by the cops,” Manuel said.</p>\n<p>The female, who Manuel said had woken up after police arrested Yamashiro, was shouting that it was Yamashiro’s fault they were locked out of their apartment and subsequently had to sleep in their car, according to Manuel.</p>\n<p>Yamashiro, who is on probation, was officially charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale, being under the influence of a controlled substance and possession of a narcotic.</p>\n<p>He was cited and released approximately 11 hours after the incident.</p>\n<p>It is unknown if Yamashiro is an Isla Vista or Goleta resident because the address provided on Yamashiro’s arrest log does not exist.</p>\n<p>Yamashiro initially enrolled at Santa Barbara City College in

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Judge Donna D. Geck ruled the UC Regents failed to provide a fair hearing for the accused student, known in court documents as John Doe, in a Title IX investigation. UCSB expelled Doe in November 2016 after a student filed a Title IX complaint against him that June.</p>\n<p>The student who filed the complaint, referred to as Jane Roe in court documents, said Doe stalked her on a daily basis after the two engaged in a sexual encounter in November 2015 and briefly dated.</p>\n<p>UCSB Title IX investigator Brian Quillen determined the stalking offense, among others, “more likely than not did occur,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Following his expulsion, Doe attempted twice to appeal the decision: once with the Interpersonal Violence Appeal Review Committee (IPVARC) at UCSB in December 2016 and then again with the California Superior Court in December 2017, contending that the initial investigation had not been fair.</p>\n<p>While the IPVARC did not find issues with the procedures of the Title IX case, Geck found issues with the IPVARC’s review. Namely, she agreed with Doe’s argument that UCSB’s internal policies were “Confusing, Internally Inconsistent, and Unfair,” and she lifted his expulsion and ordered his case be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>The IPVARC panel reconvened in February 2018 and mirrored its original decision, once again expelling Doe.</p>\n<p>Doe returned to court in June to contend that his case had not been seriously reconsidered by the IPVARC, citing the language of the original and new decision to show they were almost exactly the same, minus one introductory sentence in the latter to address the court’s complaint.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Geck ruled the new decision was “merely a poorly rewritten decision that appears to be a justification for the earlier result,” finding UCSB in contempt of the court and annulling the panel’s decision.</p>\n<p>Doe now has the option to return to the UC system beginning Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Prior to filing the Title IX complaint, Roe filed a harassment report with the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) in May 2016. After the SBSO investigation determined there was no evidence of Doe’s alleged misconduct, she then filed the Title IX complaint.</p>\n<p>Roe stated Doe, following the initial encounter, had:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>followed her “to and from her classes for nearly an entire academic year on a daily basis”;</li>\n<li>“had an unidentified third-party call Roe three times… threatened to kill her, rape her”;</li>\n<li>“waited outside of Roe’s apartment building for her”;</li>\n<li>and “deliberately maintained close proximity to Jane Roe and her boyfriend and engaged in conduct directed at her and her boyfriend” while at a sorority event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, Roe alleged she said “no” multiple times during the November 2015 encounter, while Doe stated Roe provided “affirmative consent” throughout.</p>\n<p>Doe cited text messages sent between Doe’s former roommate and Roe to prove to the court that the encounter had been consensual. One of the text messages, sent by Roe the night of the Nov. encounter, read: “The truth is, if I had been waxed and more prepared, it would have gone further.”</p>\n<p>Roe later stated these messages were sent in an attempt to cope with the alleged assault.</p>\n<p>In his statement to the court, Doe denied Roe’s allegations and alleged that she had aggressively pursued him after their initial sexual encounter in Nov., offering anecdotal evidence to demonstrate he had initially been reluctant to enter into a relationship with her.</p>\n<p>He alleged Roe, following the initial encounter, had:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“started frequently appearing in Doe’s room unannounced and uninvited”;</li>\n<li>“frequently stayed in the lounge of [his] residence hall, in his room, or outside his door for long periods of time” to the extent that he “no longer felt safe in his residence hall”;</li>\n<li>would “come to John Doe’s residence hall to party and drink alcohol”;</li>\n<li>“put up posters around John Doe’s residence hall and all over campus containing a diatribe against her alleged ‘sexual offender,’ with the objective of intimidating and harassing [him].”;</li>\n<li>and told him she would “file a restraining order against him” if he did not agree to meet with a mediator of her choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doe initially made a formal complaint to UCSB about the “harassment and stalking” by Jane Roe in December 2015. Doe said he left the school temporarily before the quarter ended to “escape the stressful situation,” alleging his grades suffered due to Roe’s harassment.</p>\n<p>Once he returned to UCSB, he requested a room change and was then allowed to move out of his residence hall.</p>\n<p>However, Doe argued in his court case that none of his allegations were taken seriously by Title IX investigator Quillen. Instead, he argued Quillen was biased in the investigation and failed to provide him with the resources he was entitled to in order to defend himself adequately.</p>\n<p>The University of California Office of the President is considering <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/title-ix/\">potential amendments</a> to its system-wide policy following a federal investigation that revealed UC Berkeley violated Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>If approved, several changes would aim to address concerns similar to those brought up by Doe in his case.</p>\n<p>The amendments would include clarifying the types of evidence to be included in an investigation, outlining the contents of a formal notice of charges, providing students with the option to question the other party through the investigator and mandating consistent training for the appeal board.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

injunction filed after UC President Janet Napolitano brought a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-08/breaking-uc-files-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-for-unlawful-daca-repeal/\">lawsuit</a> against the Department of Homeland Security, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>The injunction <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/\">mandates</a> that the Department of Homeland Security continue to process Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) renewal applications.</p>\n<p>Napolitano originally filed the lawsuit in September, alleging that President Trump’s repeal of DACA violated the rights of those utilizing the program.</p>\n<p>In addition to pursuing legal action, the UC has also been advocating for Congress to pass legislation granting DACA recipients permanent statutory protection, according to the release.</p>\n<p>“Our efforts on behalf of our DACA students and the hundreds of thousands of other DACA recipients throughout the country are far from over,” Napolitano said in the press release. “But these numbers provide some good news.”</p>\n<p>President Trump’s <a

Elections Board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> the then EVPSA-elect, Mayela Morales, in May.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-22/breaking-special-election-for-evpsa-will-be-held-fall-quarter/\">special election</a> for the EVPSA position will be held during Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew and Briseno listed several reasons in the resolution as to why the funds would be allocated this way, noting that a large portion of the EVPSA’s job begins during the summer rather than during Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>“The EVPSA must attend all UCSA and UC Regents meetings as funds permit,” the resolution states. “The EVPSA manages all forms of media as it relates to the EVPSA office… as well as the official EVPSA email which is used for all state, national, and UC wide connections.”</p>\n<p>The resolution further states that two conferences, the UC Student Organizing Summit (UCSOS) and the United States Student Association (USSA) Congress, will take place over the summer.</p>\n<p>“Failing to send delegations to these conferences will result in the lack of representation of the UCSB student community,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB student community deserves to continue being allowed to participate in<br>\nthese events since they often serve as the initial point for students to get involved in the bettering<br>\nof student affairs on- and off-campus.”</p>\n<p>The passing of the vote grants temporary access to the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) funds to the following individuals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) – Jeike Meijer</li>\n<li>Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) – Grecia Martinez</li>\n<li>Associated Students (A.S.)

Martinez will serve as the A.S. representation during the USSA board meetings.</p>\n<p>President Kopel will “contribute toward logistical work needed” to plan UCSOS with EVPLA Meijer and Lobby Corps Co-chairs.</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President (I.V.P.) Steven Ho will assign a director of accountability to oversee the above-mentioned individuals.</p>\n<p>All involved will submit bi-weekly reports to the director, who is not yet assigned, according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The individuals listed above will be “compensated for their work through the senate’s unallocated funds” and their duties will be dissolved “the date that the new EVPSA is sworn-in,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>All will be paid the equivalent of a BCU chair, according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The exact amount of funds the EVPSA office manages was not listed in the resolution.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include Carlton-Carew’s quote. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Carbajal is a co-sponsor for the Keep Families Together Act. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The facility is located approximately 45 minutes away from El Paso, Texas, and houses 319 children ages 13 to 17, according to Carbajal. The children originate predominantly from Guatemala and then Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico respectively.</p>\n<p>The detention center is operated by a private contractor, <a href=\"https://discoverbcfs.net\">BCFS</a>, which is a “global system of health and human service nonprofit organizations with locations and programs across the U.S. and abroad,” according to the corporation’s website.</p>\n<p>While Carbajal said he believes the contractor is providing a “basic level of care,” he argued that it is not the right approach to this “self-imposed, developed crisis.”</p>\n<p>“They’re woken up at 5 a.m. after they were incarcerated and regimented, they’re rushed to showers and given less than five minutes at most,” Carbajal said in an interview with the Nexus. “Because this facility is in the desert, they’re only given 10-20 minutes of recreation once or twice a day.”</p>\n<p>“So clearly, these are not optimal, adequate conditions for children,” he added.</p>\n<p>He also noted there didn’t seem to be a clear system for children to file complaints regarding assault or other grievances.</p>\n<p>Among the 319 children being housed at this facility, 26 have been separated from their families, Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Although Carbajal is an original co-sponsor for the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3036/text\">Keep Families Together Act</a> within the House of Representatives, which puts limitations on the separation of families and sets deadlines for reunification, he said he is not hopeful about the likelihood of it passing due to the Republican control of the House, Senate and White House.</p>\n<p>While U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw ordered on Tuesday that the process of family separations be ended and that children be reunited with their families within 30 days, Carbajal said he has not seen any concrete plans to do so.</p>\n<p>“This administration is now saying that they are going to reunite children but haven’t provided a shred of evidence or detail as to how they’re gonna go about doing that,” he said. “There’s a conflict of data between the Department of Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Department of the custody of children. How many of them are there? Where are they? How are they going to reunite them? It’s all a big question mark.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal also visited the United States port of entry in El Paso and questioned Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers about the current procedures in place for migrants who come to the border seeking asylum.</p>\n<p>Carbajal was disappointed by the lack of information he was provided, stating that he questioned the officers “without sufficient answers.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The answers you’re seeking, I was seeking, and clearly they’re not providing them,” he said.</span></p>\n<p>Carbajal said he was told by the CBP and the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (I.C.E.) officials that children were being kept at a facility at the border — not Tornillo — for longer than the three-day limit due to the lack of coordination between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Health and Human Services Department (HHS).</p>\n<p>“They’re violating the human rights of these children based on U.S. law. And the I.C.E. officials admitted that to me,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>The presence of I.C.E. has been criticized at UC Santa Barbara — specifically, the compliance of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) under Sheriff Bill Brown with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">publicly positioned himself</a> against Senate Bill 54, which designates that local and state law agencies not work with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Amidst calls to abolish I.C.E., Carbajal said he stands for stricter “oversight and inquiry” of the agency’s enforcement actions and says I.C.E. “indiscriminately” targets undocumented individuals rather than individuals who have committed serious crimes.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the abolishment of I.C.E…. this is a larger conversation,” he said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal instead argues that the current immigration system needs to be comprehensively reformed on a national level, calling the current system “broken.” Only after this reformation will all the issues that fall under the umbrella of illegal immigration be addressed and resolved, he said.</p>\n<p>“I’m an immigrant myself. I immigrated to this country when the immigration system worked better.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal commends the individuals who are speaking out about their “discontent and their opposition” ahead of the Families Belong Together march planned for Saturday at 11 a.m. in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We need to stay vigilant, and make sure that we press this administration. The reason they’re modifying this policy a little bit is because there’s been public outrage throughout the country, and people should continue to express themselves,” Carbajal said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
