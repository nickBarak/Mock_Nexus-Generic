There are different organizations, agencies and government officials with an interest in nutrition, physical activity, environmental health and public healthy eating and active living.”</p>\n<p>According to Long, the Coalition takes community members’ opinions into consideration when making healthy lifestyle plans.</p>\n<p>“What we do is look at it as addressing it in a collective impact type of way,” Long said. “We have different goals and objectives but when we start talking down to the nitty-gritty, we realize that even though our county program is focused on healthy eating and active living, when we start talking with our partners and with community members, we hear about barriers that need to be addressed in order for us to be successful in getting people to eat healthier and get active.”</p>\n<p>Long said the Coalition will use community-based education and policy formation to promote H.E.A.L.’s message.</p>\n<p>“A group of our coalition partners that are interested in H.E.A.L. are working on getting the word out to private businesses and individuals that can make changes that would support a healthier environment and living for themselves,” Long said.</p>\n<p>Long said involvement from other local groups and businesses will be important to H.E.A.L.’s success.</p>\n<p>“We are planning different ways to get the word out about H.E.A.L., possibly a speakers bureau to cities who do not have a H.E.A.L. resolution yet,” Long said. “Also, reaching out to community clubs and organizations such as the Rotary Club to provide information about H.E.A.L. and offer ways that they could bring this back to their employer.”</p>\n<p>Fifth District County Supervisor Steve Lavagnino, who collaborated with Carbajal to pass the resolution, said he believes it is something everyone in the County should support.</p>\n<p>“Who is going to oppose trying to get kids to eat healthy and be active? It’s one of those things everybody talks about but we need to have everyone tied in,” Lavagnino said.</p>\n<p>According to Lavagnino, the resolution aims to prompt individual County residents to make changes.</p>\n<p>“It must become a lifestyle change and not just a resolution that we’re passing,” Lavagnino said. “We need to get people’s awareness up so they can make healthier decisions in their life.”</p>\n<p>Third-year English major Olivia Kapheim said she will appreciate knowing there is a County-level effort to support healthy lifestyles among residents.</p>\n<p>“I keep up on my sleep and eat healthy meals and not just snacking throughout the day,” Kapheim said. “I think a healthy lifestyle is doable on your own, but it would be nice to have community support.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68122\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68122\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/santa-barbara-county-second-to-adopt-h-e-a-l/","id":2552,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[2551,2550,2549],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Two A.S.

OPP was disbanded earlier this month as two new political parties, Campus United and the Peer Action Coalition, were created within the last week in an attempt to bring more diversity to the A.S. senate board. A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a single transferable vote system the student elections system to a single transferrable vote (STV) process was passed in October and will go into effect this spring which will use ranking averages instead of singular votes to choose election winners.</p>\n<p>Dustin Larrazolo, PAC member and third-year biochemistry major, said PAC was created to provide “all-inclusive” and non-toxic spaces within A.S.</p>\n<p>“We want to bring everyone home to A.S. I want to open up these spaces so that the people can tell us what to do,” Larrazolo said. “The students are the leaders and we [senate] are the vote. I’m strong proponent of that and democratic caucuses.”</p>\n<p>Nushi Yapabandara, PAC member and second-year philosophy, psychology and sociology triple major, said the goal of the Peer Action Coalition is to create a safe and accepting space for students of all backgrounds to experience A.S.</p>\n<p>“We want to ensure every Gaucho feels that they can have their voice heard through our group, whether it’s them wanting to actively help us with campaigning or if it’s them addressing concerns with future candidates,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Niki Elyasi, Campus United member and third-year biopsychology major, said Campus United was created to put students first as they are the party’s priority.</p>\n<p>“We are all about the student experience and improving it the best that we can and taking action on clear consensus student issues that would benefit all of us,” Elyasi said. “So we are really a student-focused, student-run movement looking to get involved in A.S.”</p>\n<p>Elyasi said Campus United was created to bring more diversity to senate.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to get a voice out that we feel hasn’t been heard as vocally and that’s the voice of the students for improved resources and academic distinction on campus,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<p>According to Yapabandara, the purpose of the PAC is to give UCSB students from diverse backgrounds a chance to be represented by senators who identify with them.</p>\n<p>“Up until now, A.S. has been a very particular type of UCSB student,” Yapabandara said. “As someone who was a campaign manager for one of the two major political parties last year, I remember feeling very left out because the students Senate has had in the past were of a particular social group.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said PAC is comprised of student leaders from Senate, the Office of Student Life, Resident Hall Council and various other student groups to give the party.</p>\n<p>“A.S. programs only benefits about 20 percent of students and we strive to expand that through collaborations with Office of Student Life Organizations, the Residence Halls Association and student clubs to let students understand what resources are available,” Larrazolo said. “We strive to have the multiplicity representative of our university because every student is a part of A.S. I don’t think only 23 people should handle 11 million dollars.”</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she was unable to run with the Open People’s Party last year despite her desire to run for an A.S. political office.</p>\n<p>“It was very discouraging because I wanted to help make change at the university but did not have the necessary connections to even be able to run with the party,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, Campus United member and third-year history of public policy major, said one party cannot adequately represent the student body.</p>\n<p>“I think that it was an inevitable thing where you can’t just have one group that tries to represent everybody because no matter how holistic, how genuine you try to be, it just doesn’t really work,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Villarreal, A.S. President and fourth-year history of public policy major, said the formation of new parties would be healthy for senate and for the campus.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think it is good to have competition. Competition breeds excellence. Complacency breeds mediocrity,” Villareal said.</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said he encourages students to form other political parties that represent them and their values.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to start something new in hopes that other people would continue to make new parties,” Minoiefar said. “We’re hoping that other parties can come up and have their focuses too, so that the parties are more representative of a variety of interest at the school.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said one goal of PAC is to institutionalize education reform to exercise A.S.’s one third-power within university spaces.</p>\n<p>“Students will be able to address their concerns more effectively. Since Academic Affairs Board was disbanded, we have no central power with regard to our academics. What’s the point of A.S. when you can’t even lobby or express concerns in our education when A.S. isn’t there to represent them effectively.”</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said PAC wants to educate students on the resources available to them since many students do not understand what their student fees fund.</p>\n<p>“We also want to make sure Gauchos know the benefits they can receive from A.S. so that they can utilize their resources on and off campus as necessary,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said Campus United will be focusing on preventing additional student fee increases.</p>\n<p>“We have the highest fees by far out of all the UC’s but we don’t have necessarily an extreme amount of services compared to some other schools,” Minoiefar said. “I think a large focus is to ensure that what we currently take from students is being paid well and also that students are aware of where the money goes.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said A.S. does not have much control over what programs and institutions are funded.</p>\n<p>“Over here our student fees pay for the UCen, they pay for the MCC, they pay for the Rec Cen, they pay for a great deal of stuff that people don’t know they’re being paid for but we have a lot less control,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she is eager to see what happens during the elections because of the multiple parties.</p>\n<p>“I am very excited to see what will happen in this year’s elections because there are so many more parties who are also focusing on other parts of the student population, combined with the new STV system,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said has high hopes for the party’s future come spring elections.</p>\n<p>“I’m very confident in people wanting to join our party and seeing what we have to offer but I do think it will have contributed to a healthier association and a healthier campus,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: This story originally quotes Larrazolo as saying “We want to bring everyone home from A.S.

Public Safety Commission.</p>\n<p>A full house was present at Embarcadero Hall as Sferios discussed the history of MDMA, its therapeutic use and public policies regarding the drug. He offered harm reduction strategies, sold drug testing kits and reminded attendees that no drug use is completely safe.</p>\n<p>Marjan Riazi, graduate from UCSB and education and outreach coordinator for the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, said it is important students are informed on the effects of drug use and safest possible methods if they choose to experiment.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited that you are all here talking about something that is really important and certainly impacts our community,” Riazi said. “We are telling you learn the facts, learn the information … be safe, we just want you to known all the facts. Sometimes people hear things, especially in Isla Vista, that isn’t necessarily true especially when it comes to substances like MDMA.”</p>\n<p>Cole Garcia, SSDP chapter leader and a second-year biology major, said the goal of SSDP is to educate students on drug safety and public policies that can be ineffective.</p>\n<p>“Within the Isla Vista community we are working on similar things to the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, so harm reduction through education, but another goal of our group is to get future voters in our political system well educated on the ways that drug policy can be improved,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said universities typically focus on abstinence when discussing drug use, but they should instead take the same stance as they have on alcohol and educate students on how to partake as safely as possible if one chooses to do so.</p>\n<p>“The university doesn’t say just ‘don’t drink, just don’t do it!’ They say, ‘ok we know some people will and if you do you need to know what you are doing to be safe,’” Sferios said. “That same approach really needs to be happening with party drugs like MDMA and I am really glad to see that Life of the Party is here doing that.”</p>\n<p>According to Sferios, prohibition of MDMA creates a more dangerous situation in which safety education is often neglected.</p>\n<p>“I realized DanceSafe and other harm reduction programs are more trying to counter the harm that results from our drug policies,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said there are beneficial therapeutic uses of MDMA, particularly for treating PTSD, because it releases the brain’s stored serotonin.</p>\n<p>“The receptors of serotonin are excitatory and inhibitory in all the right places to reduce anxiety while at the same time making the person very alert and increasing activity in the forebrain where you put things in context and look at traumatic experiences without fear,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that the drug is always beneficial, as 15 to 20 people a year in the United States die after taking MDMA, according to Sferios.</p>\n<p>“I was told by Life of the Party that in the last five years there have been 10 deaths on this campus related to alcohol and prescription drugs but none related to Molly as far as I know on this campus,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said legal drugs may have a much higher fatality rate in the United States.<br>\n“Aspirin kills 400 people a year,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Users of MDMA should be weary of over-heating and take time to cool down and drink water to stay hydrated, because serotonin-based drugs increase the risk of heat stroke by limiting the body’s thermoregulation, according to Sferios.</p>\n<p>“There is a warning label on Prozac for the same reasons,” Sferios said. “Who has ever had a warning label when they bought their MDMA from a dealer that said be careful? No, that is because the drug is illegal and this kind of life-saving essential information is not allowed.”</p>\n<p>Sferios said public policy should aim to reduce “adulterated criminal market” that provides minors with MDMA and lacks safety regulation.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really want MDMA available in convenience stores, right? We want to protect young people, we want to protect our children,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said he recommends a regulated dispensary system through which adults could obtain pure, legal MDMA.</p>\n<p>“We would reduce the criminal market and reduce access to minors,” Sferios said. “You would still have some adults diverge and buying it and giving it to minors, but you would limit the amount of adults, you limit that process.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68121\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/dancesafe-educates-students-on-mdma/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68121\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/dancesafe-educates-students-on-mdma/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/dancesafe-educates-students-on-mdma/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/dancesafe-educates-students-on-mdma/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/dancesafe-educates-students-on-mdma/","id":2551,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2550,2549,2548],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Former Student Arrested in 2014 Campus Rape Case","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Daniel-J.-Chen-UCPD.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Daniel-J.-Chen-UCPD.png?resize=417%2C519&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara Police arrested one man Wednesday in connection with the February 2014 violent rape and assault of a UCSB student.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68090\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68090\" data-attachment-id=\"68090\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/former-student-arrested-in-2014-campus-rape-case/daniel-j-chen-ucpd/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Daniel-J.-Chen-UCPD.png?fit=417%2C519&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"417,519\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Daniel J.

Chen, 21, of San Ramon, Calif., was arrested by UCSB Police Wednesday and charged with four felonies: rape by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury; rape in cooperation with another person; battery; and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Chen is being held in Santa Barbara County Jail without bail. He was arrested in Alameda County in January on an unrelated felony charge, according to the press release, and his DNA was matched to DNA from the crime scene, next to UCSB’s track.</p>\n<p>Chen’s Facebook profile says he graduated from Northgate High School in Walnut Creek, Calif. in 2012. Chen attended UCSB from September 2012 to December 2013, according to UCPD.</p>\n<p>The female victim was raped and assaulted by three men in the early hours of Feb. 23, 2014, after being taken from Isla Vista to a secluded location next to UCSB’s track. Shortly after the incident, UCPD <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucpd-releases-sketches-of-sexual-assault-case-suspects/\">released a sketch</a> of two of the three suspects, depicting two Asian men.</p>\n<p>The victim of the crime filed a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/\">lawsuit</a> against the University of California in January alleging that the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/lawsuit-claims-dangerous-area-of-ucsb-led-to-rape/\">area of the attack was not properly maintained</a> by the university, UCSB’s Police Department had not properly investigated the case and that UCSB “skewed” its sexual assault figures to attract prospective students.</p>\n<p>In January, Tyrone Maho, an attorney for the victim, told the <em>Daily Nexus</em> he hoped the lawsuit would reinvigorate the university’s investigation into the assault.</p>\n<p>“Our hope with this whole thing is not only to draw attention to what the university did to basically allow this activity to take place … but also to help with the appeal to find the perpetrators because it has been two years and UC police have not found the suspects,” Maho said in January.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office, Department of Justice Crime Lab and the FBI assisted in Chen’s arrest.</p>\n<p>Chen will appear in Santa Barbara Superior Court on Feb. 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Tuesday evening titled “Second Class Feminists?: The Changing Role of Women in Faith Communities” for panelists and audience members to discuss the intersections of religion and feminism and the role of feminists in religions with patriarchal interpretations.</p>\n<p>The event, which took place at the MultiCultural Center Theater, featured a panel of three feminist scholars of the Catholic, Muslim and Jewish faiths. Panelists included Gina Messina-Dysert, Dean of the School of Graduate and Professional Studies at Ursuline College, Nia Malika Dixon, author, filmmaker and founder of Audaz Entertainment and Rabbi Tamara Cohen, Director of Innovation at Moving Traditions. All three panelists are contributors to <em>Faithfully Feminist</em>, a collection of 45 essays on feminism in religion, for which they held a signing after the event.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Moore, religious studies professor and department chair at UCSB, said although religion and feminism are not inherently opposed, there is conflict generated by people’s expectations that an opposition exists.</p>\n<p>“They are not an either-or dichotomy, although the conflict between religion and feminism is real,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert said it is harmful for nonreligious feminists to discount the work of religious feminists, because the success of feminism depends on working together and mutual support between the two.</p>\n<p>“Individuals who identify as religious and feminists receive a lot of judgment, if you will, from both their religious communities and from feminists,” Messina-Dysert said. “I personally find both damaging, but I find judgment from feminists more damaging.”</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert offered her definition of feminism, which she said is inspired by those of Bell Hooks and Rosemary Radford Ruether.</p>\n<p>“I like to talk about feminism as being a movement that is focused on eradicating sexism, yes, but all oppression, because you cannot uproot one without uprooting all,” she said.</p>\n<p>Religion needs feminism, according to Messina-Dysert, as it is still inundated with patriarchal interpretations that lead to oppression.</p>\n<p>“Certainly it is necessary for feminism to be a critical part of religious practice,” Messina-Dysert said. “We need to continue to acknowledge the great oppressions that still exist within religious traditions and find the ways that we can create healing.”</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert spoke specifically about Catholicism to exemplify oppressive religious traditions such as the Vatican’s resistance to reproductive rights and women’s ordination. She said women are a “blind spot” of Pope Francis, who upholds the “theology of complementarity,” which declares a woman’s purpose and value come from her role as a wife and mother.</p>\n<p>Such traditions are not inherently part of religion and should be resisted, according to Messina-Dysert.</p>\n<p>“Certainly, the foundations of religion are not sexist — it’s the interpretations that are,” she said. “Feminism allows us to work toward disrupting those problematic interpretations.”</p>\n<p>Malika Dixon said she believes God gives her the right to stand up for both feminism and religion even though many interpretations hold them in contention.</p>\n<p>“Asking a Muslim ‘why are you feminist?’ to me seems kind of misinformed, because to me, as a Muslim, I believe we are automatically feminist,” Malika Dixon said. “The patriarchy that pervades our religious beliefs is not a part of our beliefs, it’s an interpretation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68035\" style=\"width: 810px\"

traditions such as the unequal status of bat mitzvahs and bar mitzvahs, which she experienced in her conservative synagogue and orthodox school while growing up.</p>\n<p>“Girls could have a bat mitzvah, but not equal to a bar mitzvah,” Cohen said. “We could read from the Torah only on Friday night, which doesn’t really count, and not on Saturday morning.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said her family chose to have a bar mitzvah for her despite the orthodoxy of her synagogue and school, empowering her to fight for feminist reforms to Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>“I had this sense with the way we did it that if something wasn’t fair out there we could change it,” Cohen said. “It wasn’t many years later that a lot of places began to say, yes, you can do it on Saturday morning, and that change happened because women demanded it and feminists demanded it.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said she had a crisis of faith after coming out as a lesbian in college, because conservative Judaism did not allow for ordination of LGBT Rabbis, which lead her to a new understanding of feminism.</p>\n<p>“It really shook me to my core and made me think about ‘what is feminism all about?’ and ‘who is it for?’ and ‘what are the limits of a certain feminism and how do we have to push it forward?’” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>She said she has struggled to assert both her feminist and her Jewish identity due to the popular notion that they are at odds.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to be accepted as what a certain image of what a feminist was and in some sense a certain aesthetic of what a cool dyke was in that moment of the early 90s,” Cohen said. “In some sense I wanted to go underground as a religious person because I couldn’t feel the two together.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said she uses “feminine God-language” in order to unravel the core of many patriarchal religious interpretations.</p>\n<p>“If our images in terms of the ultimate power of the universe and the language we use is only male … it becomes enshrined,” she said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Evelyn Cabral said she strongly agreed with everything the panel members said during the event.</p>\n<p>“Everything to do with feminism and religion is a choice, and the intersectionality between the two of them and the parallels between the two to them,” Cabral said.</p>\n<p>Cabral said she chose to attend the event because it brought together “two good parts” of her life, referring to religion and feminism.</p>\n<p>“Usually it is hard to find events that bring these two parts of your life together. It’s usually either religion or feminism. It’s never both of them together, so that’s why I wanted to come to this event,” Cabral said.</p>\n<p>Mariam Tariq, second-year global studies and political science double major, said as a Muslim feminist she related to many of the experiences the panel discussed.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been feeling a lot of conflict about what is a woman’s role within religion,” Tariq said. “This event seemed like a good way to listen to scholars and hear what they have to say, and I thought it was really enlightening and it was a reaffirmation of everything that I believe and it’s amazing to see other women of different faiths also struggling with the same issues.”</p>\n<p>Tariq said she would like to see more events that combine feminism and faith, which are usually kept in different spheres on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think religion on campus is sort of a touchy subject. Not many people bring it up and there’s very limited spaces where you can bring it up,” Tariq said. “I don’t see this much on campus where you get to see women fighting as feminists and for their religions.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/","id":2548,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2547,2546,2545],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic building to discuss potential forms of tenant mediation in I.V. if it becomes a Community Services District (CSD) in the November 2016 county election.</p>\n<p>The group met with Andrea Bifano, representative of the Community Development Department Rental Housing Mediation of Santa Barbara County, to discuss further plans for mediation. UCSB students, who have access to mediation through the University, are currently the only I.V. residents with such services.</p>\n<p>According to Jay Freeman, who is running for Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor, stakeholders should consider the fact that UCSB students already have free mediation at their disposal.</p>\n<p>“Some of the tax money people are paying is to go towards this service that they are also getting from somewhere else,” Freeman said. “I don’t think we should fully discount them. The board will make a decision on who they want to serve. UCSB is not running this government.”</p>\n<p>Carlos Lopez, fourth-year anthropology major and A.S. Lobby Corps director, said he is interested in a new mediation program that would educate renters on how to communicate with landlords about property maintenance.</p>\n<p>“I think the ability to inform students on what their rights are when living in a house is good,” Lopez said. “There have been only a few situations when something might be going on in your house and you’re not sure if it’s your job or your landlord’s job to fix. For a lot of students who are only going to be living there for a year, it’s kind of easier to put up with it for a year.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said it is important for renters to uphold open communication with their landlords about what to do if a property needs maintenance.</p>\n<p>“Even in my house there was something wrong with our fence and one of our neighbors was talking about how when they called the landlord they got a way different response than when they went online to deal with the problem,” Lopez said. “So it’s good to establish some level of consistency in treatment on issues for tenants and the things that happen.”</p>\n<p>Audrey Tamayo, a member of the Isla Vista Tenants Union and third-year political science major, said the University mediation program does not always take into account the point of view of everyone in tenant-landlord mediations.</p>\n<p>“From my accounts with people that I know, the University’s program has not been as effective as they should,” Tamayo said. “Some of the problems include mediators twisting the words a bit, so in one instance where my friend and her roommate were having an argument and one of the tenants had pushed her up against the balcony, the mediator rephrased it as a push-shove fight. That implies a mutual kind of pushing and shoving, [but] it was only one tenant who was pushing.”</p>\n<p>According to Tamayo, many tenants, including her own housemates, fear going to the University for help with mediation because they believe it will end in a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>“I guess they are kind of scared in a way, since others are always saying that they’re going to sue you if you go do this,” Tamayo said.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus, said he appreciates that the program will provide safety for many tenants who oftentimes end up experiencing difficulty with legality.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate hearing the fact that it ultimately can result in a legally binding contract or document,” Abboud said. “A lot of the times, dealing with landlords and property managers, you might come up with a spoken agreement, but when it comes time to resolve it, there’s another thing that ends up happening.”</p>\n<p>The task force of mediators would be neutral between tenants and landlords, with discussions of creating workshops where all parties could come together to receive education on renting in I.V. The proposed tenant mediation would be incorporated into the eight percent Utility User’s Tax, which will be on the November 2016 ballot.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p>Approximately 50 students discussed the meaning and future implications of environmental racism and environmental justice at an event titled “What is Environmental Racism?” on Monday in the MultiCultural Center.</p>\n<p>The event was presented by the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E), the Human Rights Board and the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB). Attendees discussed environmental and social realities of incidents such as the Flint water crisis in Michigan, mining on Native American reservations, the I-710 corridor project and the Marcopper Mining Disaster in 1996.</p>\n<p>Nia Mitchell, EAB environmental justice chair and fourth-year environmental studies major, began the discussion by defining white supremacy and institutionalized racism.</p>\n<p>“White supremacy is an ideology in which white people or people of European descent are believed to be inherently better over people of color,” Mitchell said. “And it is institutionalized because different institutions uphold that power dynamic, so it is a disproportionate amount of power in certain communities and a lack thereof in others. When you link that system with the system of capitalism you get things like environmental racism.”</p>\n<p>Unique Vance, S.C.O.R.E. co-chair and third-year global studies major, gave an example of environmental racism.</p>\n<p>“One definition is the placement of low income or minority communities in proximity of environmentally hazardous or degraded environments,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said environmental injustice is not just exploitation of the earth and its resources, but of people as well.</p>\n<p>“It is not only that these human beings have to deal with all of this pollution, but we have to think about the flora and the fauna that is being impacted by those polluting sites,” Mitchell said. “Without exploiting land and people at the same time, capitalism, and therefore profit, cannot exist.”</p>\n<p>Vance said government institutions, either intentionally or unintentionally, often ignore toxic waste and pollution, as in the case of Flint, Michigan where the water source from Lake Huron was switched to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure until a new supply line to Lake Huron was ready.</p>\n<p>Virginia Tech researchers found the water was highly corrosive, causing public outcry over the lack of response by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder.</p>\n<p>“The government was well aware of the consequences of lead,” Mitchell said. “Lead is a known neurotoxin to human beings.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell said it is nearly impossible for Flint residents to sell their homes, a struggle that was recently chronicled in <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/us/many-flint-residents-are-desperate-to-leave-but-see-no-escape.html\">The New York Times</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Monaé Orange, third-year black studies and sociology double major, attended the event and said Flint residents are still paying full price for the contaminated water.</p>\n<p>“They are still forced to pay their water bills and they are refusing to refund them for any of that,” Orange said.</p>\n<p>Vance said the people least responsible for climate change are most impacted by it.</p>\n<p>“The modern day environmental justice movement sprouted from some really amazing activists and people who were sick and tired of their communities being targeted by the state for environmental issues,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Marjan Kris, S.C.O.R.E co-chair and second-year Asian American studies and history of public policy double major, said he and others are in the process of creating an environmental justice minor for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We are planning on creating an environmental justice minor at UCSB,” Kris said. “Future first and second-years, probably third-years too, keep an eye out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Hodges, the June 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. Dr. Ryan T. Anderson and UCSB professor of philosophy Dr. Quentin Gee argued the deeper issues of same-sex marriage, such as religion, the definition of marriage and social equality.</p>\n<p>Gee, who advocated in favor of the recent ruling, said marriage is an institution that is constantly changing and should be open to all couples.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is something that is generally defined by the society that we live in, and it changes,” Gee said. “The civil institution of marriage has undergone a number of transformational shifts. People should come to realize that the civil institution of marriage is something that should be expanded to same-sex couples.”</p>\n<p>Gee said the idea of marriage is not a “biological feature of humans,” but rather dynamic and culturally constructed.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is something that humans together collectively define in a particular way,” Gee said. “We’re expanding this notion that marriage is this idea of freedom of the individual to choose these relationships of mutual support between two people.”</p>\n<p>Gee said marriage is a “social institution” and focused his argument on the idea that marriage is not strictly for procreational purposes.</p>\n<p>“We’re changing our conception of marriage,” Gee said. “The conception of marriage has changed to what we might call a companionate sense. When you marry somebody, you are taking on an additional life partner, a companion.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, religion cannot be used as a legitimate excuse to refuse same-sex marriage and said if it is used, it is on the basis of discrimination.</p>\n<p>“There’s no clear reason to exclude same-sex couples [from marriage]. They can offer elements of companionship,” Gee said. “I don’t see any real, compelling reason, and if there is no compelling reason, it’s seems to be more or less a prejudice.”</p>\n<p>Gee said while religion is important to society, it cannot be used to enforce a law that denies rights to same-sex couples.</p>\n<p>“You cannot use religious reasons to justify or create social institutions or social contracts in ways to suit your religious needs,” Gee said. “Everyone ought to respect religion and appreciate the things it brings to our lives, but at the same time, we cannot impose it. And laws impose.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, there is no valid reason to deny same-sex couples the right to wed in any state, and said he believes religion cannot justify the rejection of their marriage.</p>\n<p>“There really isn’t a clear, justifiable reason to limit [marriage] to between a man and a woman alone,” Gee said. “I would say that you cannot use religious motivations for limiting the institution of marriage to simply a man and a woman.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Ryan T. Anderson, opponent to the Supreme Court ruling, said he supports a “conjugal vision of marriage” which presents men and women as pairs to unite as one person.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is primarily a comprehensive union of sexual complementary spouses where man and a woman unite as one flesh,” Anderson said. “The act that makes them one flesh has the capacity to create new life, and that relationship of husband and wife has the capacity to create a child with both a mother and a father.”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, since the U.S. Constitution does not mention what concept of marriage is correct, it is up to citizens to create laws on how marriages should be governed.</p>\n<p>“The 14th Amendment to the Constitution is silent to which one of those visions is true or good or the best,” Anderson said. “And where the Constitution is silent, we the people retain constitutional authority to make laws.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the flaw in the Supreme Court ruling was that it bypassed constitutional laws by enacting its own opinion on the nation.</p>\n<p>“It imposed that philosophy of marriage on the entire nation under the guise of constitutional law,” Anderson said. “There is no constitutional justification whatsoever by five unelected judges to say, ‘our preferred philosophy of marriage is now required of all fifty states simply because of our fiat.’”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, the Supreme Court violated the Constitution and said this should be a concern for all informed Americans.</p>\n<p>If you care about constitutional, democratic self-governance, you have to care about the judicial usurpation of politics, which is what took place in Obergefell,” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Anderson disputed Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s reasoning for the ruling and said the future of marriage will constantly be changed to suit different needs.</p>\n<p>“If you think about the actual arguments that Justice Kennedy made to justify his philosophy of marriage, and simply think though, what does it mean for the future of marriage? It means that marriage will simply be redefined as contract law,” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, Justice Kennedy’s ruling will cause marriage to be continuously redefined in the future.</p>\n<p>“What’s the legal principle for monogamy?” Anderson said. “What prevents future redefinitions of marriage?”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the Obergefell ruling has already affected religiously based businesses and charity organizations that refuse to support the new law.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already seen in jurisdictions where marriages have been redefined where faith-based adoption agencies have been shut down, where schools are beginning to lose their accreditation,” Anderson said. “We’ve seen bakers, florists, photographers penalized not because they said they refuse to serve gay people; their only objection was to baking the same-sex wedding cake or doing the alter flowers for a same-sex marriage.”</p>\n<p>Anderson told the story of a florist who refused to create an arrangement for a same-sex wedding. The women was sued by her state, lost the first round of her legal battles and has appealed to an appellate court.</p>\n<p>“She should have a constitutional right after Obergefell not to be forced to violate her beliefs,” Anderson said. “The Supreme Court says same-sex couple have a right to get marriage, but that doesn’t place a duty upon anyone else to help celebrate that way.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said he hopes there will be a way to discuss the issue and reach a conclusion in a respectful manner.</p>\n<p>“How do we agree to disagree about marriage without persecuting one another, without using the government as a blunt force to impose our values on others?” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history and psychology double major Iridian Magallon said before the debate, she was interested to see how Anderson would argue against same-sex marriage without relying on religion.</p>\n<p>“I was really curious as to what the arguments [Anderson] would propose, because I always thought the main argument against same sex marriage was religion,” Magallon said. “So I was curious how he was going to argue without using religion.”</p>\n<p>Magallon said she was surprised that Anderson argued his opinion well, but ultimately agreed with Professor Gee.</p>\n<p>“It was interesting that he was able to argue that side pretty well,” Magallon said. “[In the end], I was still on [Gee’s] side.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year economics and accounting major Andrew Gates, the Supreme Court ruling was unconstitutional and denied state’s rights.</p>\n<p>“The decision of Obergefell was an issue of state’s rights, and I do believe the Supreme Court was engaging in judicial fiat or judicial activism, in that they were not concerned about what the Constitution said about marriage, but rather what they believed,” Gates said. “The issue is that do the states have the right to choose should same-sex marriage be allowed, and I fully believe they should.”</p>\n<p>Gates said he was originally opposed to the Obergefell ruling and believes the Supreme Court was not justified in its action because the federal government involved itself in a state issue.</p>\n<p>“I was against the Supreme Court ruling, and I’m still against it,” Gates said. “Personally, I don’t have any problem with the state legalizing same sex marriage, but the issue is, ‘do you believe in self-governance in a constitutional republic?’ If you do, you would recognize the state right to define marriage is the state’s right, and the federal government should not interfere.”</p><div

to residence halls involved in the festivities. The Marathon will start the evening of Feb. 20, running all night. <em>Alex Gonzalez / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Dance Marathon will host UCSB’s third annual Dance Marathon from Feb. 20 to 21 to raise money for the Children’s Miracle Network.</p>\n<p>Dance Marathon is one of the nation’s largest collegiate philanthropy organizations and operates through the Children’s Miracle Network (CMN) and fundraises year-round to provide care for children at each campus’ local CMN hospital. This year, UCSB will be raising money for Cottage Children’s Hospital located in Santa Barbara, CA.</p>\n<p>Samantha Gerraty, second-year dance and biology double major and co-director of Dance Marathon operations, said Dance Marathon began at Indiana University in honor of 18 year-old Ryan White, who passed away from HIV/AIDS in 1991.</p>\n<p>“White was diagnosed with HIV/AIDs, and passed away from the disease before he could attend college,” Gerraty said in an email. “[White’s] friends held a dance marathon, which fundraised for the Riley Hospital for Children, and inspired other students across the nation to start supporting their own local CMN hospitals.”</p>\n<p>Lynn Padlipsky, fourth-year biology major and Dance Marathon executive director, said the organization hopes to raise even more funds than last year.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to raise a lot of money for Cottage Children’s Medical Center. We are hoping to outdo last year where we raised $35,000,” Padlipsky said in an email. “We are also hoping everyone comes to the event excited and leaves inspired.”</p>\n<p>Padlipsky said the Dance Marathon club at UCSB has focused on getting everyone on campus involved in the event.</p>\n<p>“The organization of the club has changed a bit, and this year we are really focusing on getting all clubs, Greek life and residence halls to participate so all of UCSB is represented,” Padlipsky said in an email.</p>\n<p>Gerraty said participants will be able to meet past recipients of the money raised through Dance Marathon and enjoy games, food and performances by UCSB student groups.</p>\n<p>“At the event, the dancers will have the opportunity to meet five miracle families — children and their families who have been helped by Cottage Children’s Medical Centre — to hear their stories and to play games and dance with them,” Gerraty said in an email. Desirae Lucas, fourth-year psychology major, said she chose to be involved in the marathon this year because she enjoys dancing and supports the event’s charity.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to participate in Dance Marathon this year for a few reasons — the first is because I love to dance and it would be a fun time to spend with all of my friends,” Lucas said. “Second, I think it’s for an amazing cause, and lastly, I also wanted to do it this year because I wasn’t able to make it last year because I got sick.”</p>\n<p>Lucas said she plans to wear comfortable shoes and to dance for the entire 12-hour event.</p>\n<p>“My strategies to survive are bringing very comfy shoes and to just keep dancing — the more you dance, the less time you’ll have to worry about your feet starting to hurt!” Lucas said.</p>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico, first-year undeclared major, said she is excited about the challenge of dancing for 12 hours continuously.</p>\n<p>“I’m most looking forward to showing off my dope dance moves while spending time with great people to support the children,” Dycaico said. “I’m also excited to see how people’s dancing changes as we approach hour 12. Maybe I’ll even challenge a few people to a dance battle.”</p>\n<p>Dycaico said she plans to prepare for the marathon by sleeping well the night before and pacing herself throughout the marathon.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to sleep a full 12 hours the night before, eat food, drink water and pace myself throughout the marathon by saving my best moves for the very end,” Dycaico said. “Plus, I’m going to start training for Dance Marathon by playing a random song on Pandora and having a mini dance party in my dorm every night for the week leading up to dance marathon.”</p>\n<p>To register

and UCSB alumnus, and Natan Sharansky, author, activist and chair of The Jewish Agency, discussed their relationships with Judaism, anti-Semitism, activism and religious pluralism Wednesday in Pollock Theater.</p>\n<p>The event was part of a three-part university tour titled “Jewish Journeys,” which began Thursday at Brown University and stopped at Stanford University before arriving at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Both Sharansky and Douglas became active in the Jewish community after their childhoods.</p>\n<p>“I grew up knowing zero about my Jewish-ness,” Sharansky said of growing up in Soviet-ruled Donetsk, Ukraine. He said he knew his family was Jewish only because it was “written on the I.D. of your parents” and because of “all the conversations about anti-Semitism and discrimination.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said being a Jew at the time was like being “born with some very rare disease,” and the only “medicine” was being the best at your trade.</p>\n<p>“Your parents are telling to you, because you are Jewish, everywhere — in school, in university, in kindergarten — you must be number one,” Sharansky said. “In physics or mathematics or in chess or in music or in dance, whatever, it doesn’t matter, you must be the best at your profession. That is the way how we Jews survive.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said many Jewish people felt a sense of community after the Six-Day War of 1967 — when Israel gained the upper hand against the Soviet Union and its Egyptian and Syrian allies —leading to increased activism among Jews.</p>\n<p>After the war in 1967, Sharansky said, “Israel entered our lives very powerfully because the victory of Israel over allies of the Soviet Union was a huge humiliation for the Soviet Union.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said, following the Six-Day War, he realized the importance of his connection to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“Suddenly, you find out, you discover that all the people around you, your friends and your enemies, they all connect you to the Israeli army,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said after his son’s bar mitzvah, his family visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem, after which the Genesis Prize Foundation recognized his commitment to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“A few pictures were taken; it made the Israeli press,” Douglas said. “The next thing I know, the Genesis group contacts me and presents this incredible prize, this opportunity which I was truly touched because I felt I was part of a tribe.”</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Israeli government opened a permanent egalitarian prayer space earlier this week at the Western Wall.</p>\n<p>“That is the place where Jews are coming for 3,000 years to talk to God and at the same time; it is the number-one national symbol,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Sharansky said years of negotiations have resulted in the understanding that even though some compromises regarding the Wall may be painful, the unity of Jewish people is more important.</p>\n<p>“For me, it is very important that we as a Jewish community always will be open and welcoming for those who are invested,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Jewish people have reason to be optimistic about their history and the future.</p>\n<p>“It is a sense of community, and I have been deeply inspired by my son and by my father,” Douglas said. “So I see and feel a continuity of generations, a sense of immortality. I am hopeful and optimistic.”</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A segment of the event, April Savage, third-year biology major, asked about interfaith climates on college campuses. Douglas responded by encouraging discussion of controversial subjects.</p>\n<p>“People always say, ‘don’t talk about politics or religion and you will always get along.’ I would encourage a dialogue and being able to open up and expose yourself and have the support of Hillel behind you,” Douglas said, referring to the Jewish nonprofit student group.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said UCSB has more Jewish undergraduate students than any other UC campus and that 160 students traveled to Israel on birthright trips last year.</p>\n<p>Andrew Packer, third-year economics and accounting major, described his experience with Santa Barbara Hillel and his birthright experience.</p>\n<p>“For me, Santa Barbara Hillel has enabled me to reconnect with my Jewish roots,” Packer said. “It allows me to continue my cultural exploration of Judaism and opens the dialogue on religion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67943\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67943\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/jewish-journeys-brings-michael-douglas-to-speak-on-anti-semitism-more/","id":2543,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2542,2541,2540],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss Senator Dustin Larrazolo’s possible resignation, funding for the Anscombe Society’s debate on marriage and recent protests against the California Border Patrol’s (CBP) Career Fair presence.</p>\n<p>Larrazolo, a CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major, gave a speech in public forum citing reasons for his possible resignation at the end of the Winter 2016 Quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Larrazolo, he began to consider resignation after fellow senate members allegedly met with Hispanic and queer communities with which he was working, without Larrazolo’s knowledge, to work against his plan to host a public open caucus. The caucus, which Larrazolo planned to host at his house, would have been an opportunity for students to discuss concerns and ideas going into the upcoming spring elections and the potential founding of a new political party.</p>\n<p>“Tonight I am pouring out my heart because I ran for office with promise that I would have voices be heard or I’d die trying,” Larrazolo said. “Seeing those whom I’ve trusted in this process meet in secret to end open caucus spaces that I was going to host at my own home has pushed me to the brink.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said he was hospitalized for mental health reasons after becoming excluded from the Hispanic and queer communities with which he identified.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been going through a lot lately,” Larrazolo said. “To lose the safe spaces I have built here on campus, that’s all I had left.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said many senators do not follow the values of the identities of which they claim to have.</p>\n<p>“It is disgraceful that some of you label yourselves as allies and progressives. OPP [Open People’s Party] is not the only problem, so stop using it to protect your work as well,” Larrazolo said. “I only wanted to represent queers, Latinos and CCS students.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said A.S. political parties create the illusion of unity under shared values, which according to Larrazolo is not an accurate representation of OPP.</p>\n<p>“I was put into some kind of battle that I thought I had to fight and I want to apologize to those of you who have been afflicted by this whole predicament of political parties,” Larrazolo said. “We have aligned ourselves with things that do not exist. I am sorry to all of you, and with this I am announcing possibly my intent of resignation.”</p>\n<p>Senate also discussed the Anscombe Society’s plan to host a debate between scholars for and against “nontraditional marriage,” and its role, or lack thereof, in funding the event. The Anscombe Society, which advocates for traditional marriage as the only valid definition of marriage, requested funding from A.S. Finance and Business Committee (A.S. F&amp;B), an A.S. Senate entity, for a debate between Dr. Ryan T. Anderson and UCSB philosophy professor Dr. Quentin Gee.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B originally chose not to fund the event, and the Anscombe Society spoke to Senate to challenge the decision.</p>\n<p>Carlos Flores, Anscombe Society president and fourth-year philosophy major, said the A.S. F&amp;B rational to not fund the debates based on the capabilities of the participants was not justified.</p>\n<p>“Whether you think that Dr. Gee is a capable opponent or whether this event is balanced should be irrelevant in your decision on whether to provided funding,” Flores said. “If balance were a criteria for providing funds, no leftist speaker would be funded on this campus.”</p>\n<p>Flores said the event is an academic event that promotes political and philosophical discussion.</p>\n<p>“It contributes to the mission of this institution as an institution of learning,” Flores said. “It is also balanced to the extent that this is a debate and Dr. Gee, I assure you, is a good debate opponent.”</p>\n<p>Flores said funding from A.S. is “crucial” if the event is to occur.</p>\n<p>“As it stands, we do not have sufficient funds for Anderson’s honorarium expenses and room rental costs and CSO’s, etc.,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>Senate voted to review A.S. F&amp;B minutes and fully funded the event in a 20-0-1 vote.</p>\n<p>Senate also discussed the protests that broke out against CBP at the recent Career Fair, which some students found upsetting.</p>\n<p>Michael Torbati, off-campus senator and third-year economics and accounting major, said the protest was not what he expected it to be and that peers have told him they believe it negatively impacted the school.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that it didn’t really get carried out the way I thought it would, what we were told would happen in Senate,” Torbati said. “Entering the actual Career Fair was probably not the best decision, I was told from people who were there. They told me that it didn’t really do well for our reputation [to employers].”</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Fung, off-campus senator and third-year economics and accounting major, said the protest made students nervous to talk to the employers, which he feels defeats the purpose of a career fair.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t fair to the students. I’m not saying anything against the protest itself, but the way it was carried out,” Fung said. “I felt embarrassed when I was walking around the area saying ‘I stood behind that,’ because when I was there, from what I saw and what I heard, I couldn’t stand behind that.”</p>\n<p>Akshaya Natarajan, off-campus senator and second-year political science major, said she understands the concerns of the students attending the Career Fair, but A.S. does not understand what undocumented students go through.</p>\n<p>“These are very valid concerns, and I completely understand that this is definitely a shame that students felt uncomfortable and perhaps personally attacked, but we also have to keep in mind that most of us sitting at this table are not in the shoes of these people,” Natarajan

business owners and managers shared their experiences with the Nexus this week regarding the recent power outages amidst stormy weather in the Goleta area.</p>\n<p>Many local businesses have reported losing all electricity with the onset of El Niño storms. On Jan. 5, for example, strong winds damaged infrastructure and caused a power outage throughout I.V.’s downtown business district that lasted several hours, and smaller power outages have followed. In such circumstances, many businesses report having to close stores until power is restored.</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Co-op general manager Melissa Cohen said the co-op lost at least half of its sales on Jan. 5 as the result of a power outage that rendered the store closed for five hours. According to Cohen, the store averages about $10,000 a day in sales, but it only made about $5,000 on Jan. 5.</p>\n<p>“It’s very hard to have to sit at the entrance of your business and say, ‘Sorry there’s no power,’” Cohen said. “That was stressful and our sales that day really suffered.”</p>\n<p>Otaco manager and third-year sociology student Richard Kim said the restaurant loses money during power outages, especially when the blackouts occur at night.</p>\n<p>“It does affect our numbers because we sell beer and beer sells better at night,” Kim said. “It hurts financially.”</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Drip owner Tom Leu, however, the power outage saved his restaurant money because business was already slow during recent storms and the loss of power allowed him to send employees home.</p>\n<p>“That was a perfect time for a power outage,” Leu said.</p>\n<p>Aladdin Café employee Steven Abdulhai, whose family owns the restaurant, said his family will usually check in with their neighboring restaurant Woodstock’s Pizza to determine whether or not to close during power outages.</p>\n<p>“We like to keep ourselves updated with Woodstock’s — we’re cool with the employees there,” Abdulhai said. “If it’s not too serious for them to be closing, then we’ll probably stay open.”</p>\n<p>Buddha Bowls owner Daniel Dunietz said the “real issue” with power outages is maintaining food temperatures. According to Dunietz, the loss of power shuts down refrigeration, which can cause food to spoil over a certain period of time.</p>\n<p>“There is a fair amount of built-in insulation, but we still watch those temperatures slowly rise,” Dunietz said. “Once it gets past a certain point, [the food] becomes dangerous, and if it stays at that point for some time, you have to throw out everything.”</p>\n<p>Dunietz said he instructs his employees to keep the coolers closed to preserve the cool air inside in case of outages.</p>\n<p>“We have a protocol where you just don’t open the cooler, because it is insulated so it can keep that temperature cool for almost six to eight hours,” Dunietz said.</p>\n<p>Dunietz said Southern California Edison has usually had a quick response time to damaged infrastructure during storms.</p>\n<p>“The guys at Edison have been really awesome, so I’ve been giving them coupons and stuff,” Dunietz said. “They bust their ass.”</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, power outages have some positive results.</p>\n<p>“The beauty of those power outage days is that celebration when the power goes back on,” Cohen said. “We can invite our people back into our store.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/","id":4587,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4586,4585,4584],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":99,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
