[The] day of, we all showed up, we were all ready … But the only thing is not a lot of kids showed up,” Ornelas said. “Three kids showed up, which is really unfortunate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tradition of trick-or-treating is often lost on those residing in Isla Vista, especially for the local youth in search of bite-sized fun. Events like Haunt the Loop help provide an opportunity to engage in a community often tailored to a much different demographic. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/islavistacdpcalifornia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last census</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2010, less than three percent of Isla Vista’s 23,096 residents were under the age of 18; within that, less than 0.9 percent were under the age of three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like the children around this area don’t really have a normal childhood as other children would have, because they live in a college town,” Joana Gutierrez, a third-year sociology major who volunteered at Haunt the Loop, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re constricted of doing many things, especially during the holidays, because it’s not really safe for them to go out when everybody is going out and getting drunk and partying. So I feel like it’s very important that [we] as students take them out to safely trick-or-treat and show them that we care about them having a childhood.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But only a few volunteers got to answer this call. Trick-or-treating was supposed to be over a two hour period from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. last Sunday, with volunteers leading groups of children from one spot to another. The first </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and only </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> group to arrive came to the Pardall Center around 3:30 p.m. But around 4 p.m., Ornelas said the volunteer crew began packing up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s drop in numbers took organizers by surprise. Both the planning and the event itself were based entirely off of last year’s report, according to Shannon Sweeney, the EVPLA chief of staff, who put the event together alongside Andy Ruiz, the EVPLA community events coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can never really guess predictability on the kids’ end, just because every year it’s different </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> what they might be doing that weekend,” Ruiz said. “The businesses are always so amazing at helping out with that, being very cooperative, allowing us to invite people into their business for community betterment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two worked from a report left by former Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) organizer Alex Young, who detailed the process in which organizers hosted the event last year. Like last year, according to Ornelas, the I.V. CSD coordinated with the EVPLA office to advertise the event with posters through I.V. Youth Projects (IVYP) and I.V. Elementary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The youth-oriented nature of the event proved to be one of the biggest challenges in planning and publicizing it, Sweeney said. While most events targeted for students are advertised through Facebook and Instagram, Haunt the Loop’s audience </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">children and their parents </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">required a different kind of grassroots approach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tackle that, the EVPLA staff brought their posters to the I.V. CSD, who then shared it with IVYP’s Family Resource Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said the planning process was “exactly the same as last year,” and couldn’t deduce why the turnout was significantly lower compared to Haunt the Loop in years past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It could have been any number of things … sometimes events just don’t have a lot of people come to them. It was a great success last year; it was a lot of people. Who knows why people didn’t come this year?” Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fifteen local businesses in and around the Loop </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">including Buddha Bowls, Rockfire Grill, Cajé, Amazon and the I.V. Bicycle Boutique </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">partnered with the EVPLA office to pitch in with candy distribution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers were on hand to provide candy to participating businesses, but Ornelas said many provided their own and decorated for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With plenty of leftover candy to spare, Ornelas also is not sure what caused this year’s small turnout. Hosting the event on Sunday afternoon </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the same day as last year’s Haunt the Loop </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> likely isn’t the problem, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruiz said the Sunday afternoon slot was chosen for safety concerns for children and for volunteers who would be difficult to schedule during the week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with this year’s low attendance in mind, Ornelas is discussing with Sweeney and Ruiz about moving the event closer to Halloween in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas speculates that the areas to the north of I.V. are a more popular option for candy collecting as “a lot of children go trick-or-treating in the community behind FT” and as it is outside of I.V., which may be safer and more receptive to children. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of working through I.V. CSD and other organizations, Ornelas believes that in the future, the EVPLA office should be more direct in its outreach by keeping more of the workload in-house to draw the most outreach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s Haunt the Loop was a learning experience, Ornelas said, in part because the responsibility of hosting the event fell onto new shoulders, and the small showing left most involved scratching their heads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the fliers, pounds of candy and weeks of preparation, when an event doesn’t turn out the way you had it envisioned, Ornelas said: “It just sucks.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the Oct. 31, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-90840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long associated with the hippie and counterculture movements, the widespread availability of psychedelics and other substances in the 1960s attracted the concern of governments worldwide, leading to the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970 and the further stigmatization of psychedelics in American culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ever since psychedelics were criminalized by Nixon around the early ‘70s, it’s been hard to use them in research or therapy,” Emily Gworek, fourth-year biopsychology major and cofounder of UCSB’s Psychedelic Club, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this is changing — the conversation and culture around psychedelics is beginning to shift, she emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the past couple of decades … people have been pushing those bureaucratic boundaries and working the drugs through clinical trials,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded by UCSB students Gworek, Surya Santhanam and Kristel Kerrigan, Psychedelic Club of UCSB aims to provide a space on campus to facilitate honest discussions about psychedelics.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first branch of Psychedelic Club was established at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2014. Psychedelic Club’s overarching mission is to “increase mainstream cultural awareness and acceptance of psychedelics,” according to a statement from its </span><a href=\"https://www.psychedeliclub.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On the very basic level, we want to be a safe space for people to come and talk about whatever interest they have in it. Bad or positive experiences, life-changing experiences. We want them to be able to connect with people about [psychedelics] and learn,” Kerrigan, a fourth-year biopsychology major, said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of us are biopsychology majors; we know how [psychedelics] work on your brain and how it affects your body. We want to actually inform people on that and actually talk about research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychedelic Club of UCSB is the first branch of Psychedelic Club in California and the 10th in the nation, with other branches located in Colorado, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maine, according to its website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek first became aware of Psychedelic Club while browsing research on the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (M.A.P.S.) website, stumbling upon a link to the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then reached out to Clayton Ickes, the vice president of Psychedelic Club at CU Boulder, and began discussions to establish a branch of Psychedelic Club at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Gworek was starting to have conversations with other UCSB students surrounding their shared interest in psychedelics research. Over the summer, Gworek communicated with Santhanam over text, although they didn’t meet in person until the beginning of this school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two were intrigued by historical research into psychedelics, as well as the growing acceptance of psychedelics in present-day psychological research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] see all this valid research — although most of it was done in the ‘60s before the giant ban on drugs,” Santhanam, a third-year psychological and brain sciences major, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were these incredible findings with people with terminal illnesses. Psychedelics had this capacity to help people accept death or change their attitudes toward death, which I think is phenomenal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research also indicated that psychedelics were effective in managing disorders like anxiety and depression and even had a degree of effectiveness when other medications weren’t working, according to Santhanam. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only recently have institutions began to address the subject of psychedelics on a large scale, Gworek said. In September, Johns Hopkins University opened a center for psychedelic research: The Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. Funded with $17 million from private donors, it is the first research institution of its kind in the United States and the largest of its kind in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“John Hopkins has opened their research center for psychedelics, which is amazing. I would love to be a part of that and get more labs open to that, although definitely something that needs to happen now is that [psychedelics research] needs to be more structured and have more direction,” Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santhanam, Gworek and Kerrigan were also interested in how the everyday person could benefit from psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics can allow even your average person to get new perspectives on life and it allows people to be really introspective and remind you how important it is to be present and intentional with the things that you do,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When a psychedelic is metabolizing the serotonin receptor, it seems to fire much faster and also can make parts of your brain interact that don’t normally communicate,” Santhanam added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Santhanam, psychedelics allow one to reexamine aspects of their life in manners which are difficult to perform without psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek, Santhanam and Kerrigan intend to use the club as a platform to inform people of the benefits and drawbacks to using psychedelics, as well as dispel common misconceptions regarding psychedelics and how they compare to other drugs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics are not the go-to drugs for most people. You’d be surprised by how many people may have heard about it but don’t even know what a psychedelic is,” Santhanam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the near future, Psychedelic Club would like to bring speakers and advocacy organizations to campus, such as EntheoMedicine, as well as host risk management events in the style of The Zendo Project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EntheoMedicine people are the people that kind of guide you through your trip and they host events in other countries where it’s legal, and they’re kind of guides when you’re on it. They said they’d be interested, and that they really want to talk to young people, Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Zendo Project is a program associated with M.A.P.S., which provides psychedelic harm reduction to those at festivals, concerts and other events where psychedelic substances may be used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re at a festival and you’re using psychedelics and things get weird and you’re uncomfortable and you’re anxious and you’re overwhelmed because you’re surrounded by thousands of people and pounding music, they provide a safe space where you can go,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have therapists who are trained to deal with people having a difficult psychedelic experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek plans to host a psychedelic harm reduction event in the same vein to teach people about risk management, how to best navigate bad trips and, beyond that, what to learn from difficult trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If something goes wrong like that, that’s an anxiety that a lot of people have about using psychedelics. It’d be nice to educate people on how to best handle those kinds of situations,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But above all else, the priority of Psychedelic Club is to start the conversation about psychedelic use. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping the club will just be a place where people who are interested in psychedelics or psychedelic research or just the psychedelic experience in general … can just kind of congregate and have those discussions,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the Oct. 31, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

But over the past 13 years, it has grown to become the Halloween hub of Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the myriad of costume-esque clothing and accessory options, Sweet Jane sells birthday supplies, festival clothes and Isla Vista-specific merchandise — like “U Can Study Buzzed” shot glasses and Isla Vista flags, various bongs and pipes and sunglasses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve never raised the prices on our sunglasses,” owner Stella Termin added, waving toward the towering display by the cash register. “They’ve always been buy-one-get-one.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Sweet Jane is known for its costume- and festival-ready inventory, students flock to the boutique at all times of the year, drawn in by the boutique’s unique Isla Vista college town vibes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I keep hearing it over and over again, ‘I love this store, I want everything in here,’ and it’s like yeah, this is the store where you want everything you don’t probably need,” Termin laughed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s just because [the store is] unusual.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having been a small business owner in I.V. for so long, Termin has seen how the culture of the college town has changed as students roll through it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, Termin said she sold a lot of clothes and jewelry with peace signs. “The kids were into revolution.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never bought anything in camo or anything, and all of a sudden they started having camouflage parties,” she said. “I can see that there’s a difference — there’s a big difference.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Termin attributes the change in culture in I.V. to the rise of social media, pointing to the Facebook event for Floatopia in 2009 that drew over 12,000 people to I.V.’s beaches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were actually on the sand; we were giving out water,” Termin said. “Let me tell you — I’ve never seen so many people on that beach.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took a half an hour just to get up and down the [beach] stairs; you couldn’t walk anywhere without stepping on a bottle or a can,” she added. “All the recycling people, the families, it was like their Black Friday.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Had that not been posted on Facebook, we could have maybe still had, at least for a few more years, some real Floatopia,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s kind of sad, ‘cause I see things change, you know, since when I first started.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just in the past few years, Termin has seen many I.V. businesses come and go — she named Firehouse Subs, Giovanni’s Pizza Restaurant and 212° Hotpot, which closed recently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that while some of the rent prices may seem doable at first sight, businesses have to consider the weeks or months during which students vacate Isla Vista, like over the summer or winter break. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not a continuum,” she said. “I’ve been lucky, knock on wood, because I was able to strategize and realize what I needed to do — I don’t know how — what I needed to do to be able to provide for what Isla Vista needed and wanted and to have fun.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90861\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/theres-no-place-quite-like-sweet-jane/sweet-jane-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-90861\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90861\" data-attachment-id=\"90861\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/theres-no-place-quite-like-sweet-jane/sweet-jane-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=2048%2C1362&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1362\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sweet jane 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90861\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alaska Yokota / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the high rents in Isla Vista, Termin added that there are a handful of licenses and taxes that she has to pay every year that make running a small business more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wish that they would give smaller businesses, especially those in seasonal, this type of environment, more tax breaks and more of tax initiatives, instead of pounding us over the head as businesses that make over half a million dollars a year,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Sweet Jane’s success, Termin said she thinks she has been around long enough to be able to maintain her level of business through word of mouth and the fact that most of her prices are cheaper than Amazon’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just think it’s being nice, treating your customers well, understanding what they need, put a smile on your face and be lucky,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweet Jane has rooted itself in the community, particularly through a handful of fun traditions. During the interview, Termin was ringing up students and noticed that one student was purchasing items for a birthday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Is it a birthday?” she asked. The student said yes, and Termin pulled out a box of buttons and stacks of cups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get to pick a birthday mug and free birthday button,” Termin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really?” the student said. “These are so cute!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s fun,” Termin said afterward. “They get excited, because birthdays are big deals, whether they’re yours or somebody else’s.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the birthday cup tradition, Sweet Jane creates new sticker designs every month that the store gives out for free. Another student at the register fawned over the newest design, telling Termin that she had all of the most recent ones and that they were her favorites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Termin lived at the far end of Trigo Road for a few years in the ‘90s with a then-boyfriend, it wasn’t until a friend brought her here in 2006 that she really saw Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just nice, over the years, to see the road the store has been on and the different people that have passed through here. So many students have worked here, and it’s great,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Sweet Jane is well loved, and that makes me very, very proud and happy.

However, the office does keep copies of the allegations on file, even if the student isn’t punished following a first infraction, according to the warning emails sent to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve never tried to get an ID in the past, but I’m on Free and For Sale and I see the posts all the time and I know it’s a common thing people do,” said a fourth-year anthropology major, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The student posted on the Free and For Sale page looking for an extra ID so their younger sister, who is not a UCSB student, could attend Delirium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After posting on the Facebook page, a warning email from the Office of Student Conduct appeared in the student’s inbox. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t even think about it being an issue because everyone’s been doing it for so long. It’s something that I see around this time of year every single year, for all the concerts,” the student added. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB does not go through the Free &amp; For Sale page looking for offenders, according to Armistead. Instead, she said the university receives reports and screenshots of student ID sales from other individuals, often students, who use the page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people who run the Facebook group used to take down and report posts about ID sales, but due to the sheer volume of posts, they are simply unable to keep up with all of them, according to the page’s administrator, Dayllan Maar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the university really cares that much about it, they’re more than welcome to look through the page and find everyone who’s violating the rules,” Maar said. “If the university doesn’t view it to be that important of a rule, I don’t know why I should enforce a rule the university doesn’t want to enforce.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University administrators, police officers and members of Associated Students are all members of the Facebook page, meaning that they can see when students make posts about ID sales, according to Maar. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maar said he suspects UCSB is cracking down on the posts now due to the page’s growing user base, which had 20,000 members when he became a moderator in 2017, but has doubled to over 40,000 members in the last two years. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead’s assertion that the presence of non-students at student-only events opens the door to safety concerns was backed up by Student Advocate General Andrew Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is most dangerous is when people outside of Isla Vista and the UCSB community come to Isla Vista and UCSB and they pose a potential danger to our community because they’re not from this community,” Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have no stake in this community, there’s no personal ties.

CSD) meeting. The updated budget still features many of the original proposal’s designs, such as the beer garden and the music stages; however, cuts were still made to several areas to reduce the event’s overall cost, including having less fencing and fewer portable toilets, information kiosks and targeted Facebook advertisements. The updated budget also cut the number of giveaways in half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Isla-Vista-April-2020-Event-Production-Budget-Reduction-Budget-159K.pdf\">new proposal</a> further removes one of the music stages, a reduction of $7,000, that could potentially be brought back with a sponsorship — something that UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) could potentially fulfill, according to I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud presented a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Isla-Vista-April-2020-Event-Production-Budget-Sheet3.pdf\">variety of options</a> to enable the board to fund the event during Tuesday’s meeting, including asking UC Santa Barbara to fund the street </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lighting project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as drawing money from different sources in the I.V. CSD budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the reductions, some board members still expressed concern over the lack of official partners and sponsorships to help cover the cost of the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of last Tuesday’s meeting, no other entity has agreed to fund the festival. However, Board President Spencer Brandt named UCSB, A.S., Santa Barbara City College, the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District, the city of Goleta and local businesses as current potential sponsors for the festival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the number that we have in front of us with no else at the table with us, I’m not comfortable using our revenue for it, in the full amount,” Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Kristie Nguyen agreed with Bertrand’s concerns and suggested scaling down the size and cost of the event to gauge the community’s response, and afterward, determine if the festival was a success and warrants a greater investment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we find out if [the spring festival] is going to be successful, then we can start funding more money. But as of right now, we don’t know the success rate, and we won’t know until it actually happens,” Nguyen said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has also shouldered a portion of its festival budget under Operating Expenses but stressed that the Safety and Security portion is “NOT THE PLACE TO CUT” in the budget, as stated in the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been continuously telling people that the reason why we want to do this is not because we want Deltopia to be shut down.

id=\"caption-attachment-67162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The reference desk was merged with the services desk. <em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reference desk, previously 30 feet away from the library’s mountain side entrance, was removed on Sept. 14 and merged with the services desk by the Paseo West entrance; while this may be a new change to the UCSB community, Library </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communications &amp; Marketing Manager Hannah Rael believes that it isn’t an outdated practice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reference desk removals at libraries [have] been a trend for more than a decade,” Rael said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, library reference desks are desks that professional librarians sit at to help direct students to what they are looking to find. But due to internet advances and other technical innovations that allow users to access information in a handful of seconds, libraries have had to rethink the ways in which they make directional and reference information easily accessible to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Rebecca Metzger, associate university librarian for research, the merging of</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the reference desk and services desk is the culmination of a three year-long planning process involving the strategic review and redesign of the library’s frontline service model. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During those [three] years, we gathered data, held facilitated discussions with reference librarians and staff, introduced an online system for booking reference appointments and experimented with different hours and staffing models,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brightspot, a strategy firm dedicated to collaborating with universities and other institutions in order to improve student services based on technological shifts and social changes, was brought in to assist library staff with the redesign to better serve users of the library. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We worked with [Brightstop] for two months, guided by a steering committee in the library. Two open town halls were held for library staff, and Brightspot led multiple additional focus groups to gain input,” Metzger said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metzger explained that the ultimate goal was to provide library visitors with a well-structured experience. Formerly, each desk was managed by a different library department and staff went through distinct training programs. Now that the desks are merged, all desk staff will have the same consistent service training and be able to provide users with answers to whatever questions they may have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to improve the user experience and service consistency. In the past, it wasn’t obvious which desk to start at. Students would sometimes get bounced back and forth between the two desks to get the answers they needed,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, as reported by the </span><a href=\"https://www.arl.org/arl-statistics-survey-statistical-trends/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Association of Research Libraries</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there has been an 84% decrease in reference questions within the past twenty years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Metzger, only one-third of the questions asked at the Davidson Library’s reference desk were reference-related questions. By removing librarians from the reference desk, their time is no longer spent addressing basic questions that can instead be answered by trained staff and students at the service desk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, this merge allows the library to make more effective use of its resources, Metzger stressed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were investing in duplicative staffing by having student assistants and staff on the reference desk and services desk only 30 feet apart at the same time,” Metzger said. “Our data shows us that the same types of questions were being asked at each desk, [and] by streamlining our staffing, we are able to continue to invest in other projects that improve the library.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the services desk now takes on reference-related matters, it still maintains many of its old functions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The services desk continues to be the spot for checking out books, media, course reserves, interlibrary loans, laptops and other materials,” Metzger said. “In fact, you can now also check out calculators, phone chargers, bike locks, board games and frisbees.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Library users are encouraged to submit their feedback via the library’s online s</span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/suggestions.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uggestion box</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, said Metzger. Alongside a handful of students submitting feedback saying that they miss the reference desk, library staff have also had to grow accustomed to these changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Library staff are still learning how to provide service in the merged environment so there may be some growing pains, but they are deeply committed to providing quality service to our UCSB community,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, the library is currently in a transition period as it has moved on to revamp its service training program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are monitoring how [the training program] is going and are open to making tweaks as we learn more. The truth is that we live in a fast-paced environment where library services have the potential to change regularly based on trends, user behavior and input and data,” Metzger said.</span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-90634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is designed to help international students find their way around UCSB. </span><em>Sam Rankin/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Rifkin, a program coordinator at the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), said over email that the program is designed to help international students find their way around UCSB, “creating opportunities for both international and domestic students and staff to build friendships, share cultures, and developing critical 21st century cross-cultural communication skills in a welcoming and supportive small-group setting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OISS staff anticipates roughly 133 mentors and mentees in total for this fall quarter. The office plans to put on events throughout the year for mentorship pairings, but the goal for the program is for the pairs to find and share commonalities in their free time as well, Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes a great deal of courage to leave your family and friends behind to pursue their academic aspirations,” Rifkin said. “The Global Ambassador Program tries to ensure that our international students feel welcome and included.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mission of OISS is to “cultivate an inclusive environment which supports international students academically, professionally and personally by providing holistic advising on immigration, employment and cultural matters</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” according to its website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff and advisors at OISS recognize that international students often have difficulty making friends and can feel uncomfortable sharing their culture, Rifkin said, and added that similar programs have found success at universities like UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunity to mentor also gives experienced UCSB students the opportunity to gain important skills in an increasingly global world, Rifkin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This holds true with Lauren McKnight, a third-year biochemistry major who was a tour guide for international students over the summer who said she wanted to continue cultivating those relationships during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having grown up in southern California, I’ve always been really familiar with the culture in California and the U.S. By getting to know my mentees and other international students, I get to see a little bit more of their perspective of the environment here,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McKnight added that the Global Ambassador Program not only creates an easier transition for international students but overall increases campus diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Joost, a global ambassador and fourth-year global studies major, said she has cultivated friendships that extend beyond the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also have a great line of communication through [Snapchat] and WhatsApp. We try to meet [up] just to study, or if one of us is just hanging out in IV we try to let the group know that they can join us!” Joost said over email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am hoping to build some great friendships and to learn more about the different cultures within my group,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another mentor, Jordan Kaiser, fourth-year global studies major, said she understood the difficulty of trying to cross a cultural barrier from her time studying abroad in Berlin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wished I had a program like this when I was abroad. I often felt confused or lost when I was abroad and had a hard time breaking out of my ‘American bubble,’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Rifkin, the program not only benefits international students but also the ambassadors who learn to view the world through a “different cultural lens,” particularly those interested in working in an international field or studying abroad.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As international educators we recognize that global exchange is a two-way street,” Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s domestic students and staff stand to learn just as much as from our international students and scholars as they do from joining our campus community.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

and pat-downs outside of the Thunderdome</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of these discussions came the idea for a big Halloween concert, which Armistead said was completely student-run. Beyond providing security, portable toilets and parking, the university has no role in putting together the event; instead, members of the Associated Students Program Board (ASPB) spend months gathering booking data about artists, reaching out to their agents and narrowing down the list of potential performers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathaly Pacheco, special events coordinator for ASPB, fields requests from students and other board members about the genres of music or artists they want to see perform at the annual event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure we cater to what you guys want,” Pacheco said, emphasizing that events are funded by student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With board as a whole, no matter what we do, we have to think students are our number one priority.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past week, Pacheco and the rest of the ASPB staff have been working to ensure the show runs smoothly. On Saturday, Pacheco and the production coordinator will be starting their day at 7 a.m. to oversee the set up of all the production equipment, like the audio, lighting and any special equipment Program Board ordered at the artist’s request. They won’t go home until 2 a.m., when they wrap up clean-up for the show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco, who is going into her third year on Program Board, said her experience on the board in previous years has helped her work with other members more cohesively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I truly feel like you can’t be a good leader unless you know what the other people that are working for you are doing,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this year’s show, and her time on Program Board as a whole, Pacheco said it was important to her to bring a diverse lineup to campus; she pointed out that UCSB has never had a female headliner perform at any of their shows. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a big problem, even within the industry; it’s like such an issue of seeing powerful women or seeing women being represented in this specific industry,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco said Program Board was actually in touch with Megan Thee Stallion to bring her for Delirium but said the timing didn’t work out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Leikeli47, one of the supporting acts at this year’s Delirium, Pacheco said the board tries its best to “bring and showcase diversity when it comes to the artists that we bring to the campus and stay on the wave of artists that we think are only going to keep growing and growing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really, really want to make sure that we do that this year,” she said. “I know that we have a really big Latinx community here at this school — it’s the second biggest demographic — but we don’t cater to Spanish music or other different genres of music.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiyomi Morrison, program board commissioner, emphasized Pacheco’s sentiments about wanting to invite more student input to Program Board’s internal processes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d like [students] to meet the Program Board people, and then also make our office hours available so they can come in at any time, talk to anyone, not only for talking about the programs that we do, but if they need help doing events or if they are interested in working or volunteering with us,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Morrison pointed to the Associated Students’ Finance and Business Committee’s public posts last year that documented where student fees were going and said that was something she was interested in implementing, particularly because Program Board has a high lock-in fee, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Program Board is working with a budget of $1,110,106.25 for the 2019-2020 academic year, according to a budget presented by last year’s commissioner, Ryanne Ross, at the end of last year. While a lot of the budget goes toward the larger special events, Program Board also puts on regular Free Tuesday Films, Storke Tower shows, shows in the Hub, lectures and other events throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the money that Program Board makes from charging for smaller events goes toward subsidizing costs for larger events, Morrison added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to events like Delirium, Morrison and Pacheco said the safety of students is of the utmost priority to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We throw a lot of big festivals where a lot of people are drunk and that kind of stuff, and also, police are required to be there,” Morrison said. “We’re on the student side … we are here for you guys and we want to make sure you are safe, first and foremost.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco said police presence at this year’s show is expected to be the same as previous years, and that students can expect metal detectors and pat-downs outside of the Thunderdome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know that Halloween here is pretty dead, and it’s just like, people go home, people decide to go to other places,” Pacheco said. “This is one of the things that people can do in a fun and safe way.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Speakers at the recital included Margo Halsted, former UCSB university carillonist; John Majewski, UCSB dean of humanities and fine arts and Nick Masuda, director of news at the Santa Barbara News-Press.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The structure and the instrument resting within the tower were both gifts from the late Thomas M. Storke, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and owner of the Santa Barbara News-Press for 32 years. During the dedication ceremony on Sept. 28, 1969, he stated: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is my hope that the publications coming from this building will be the finest examples of journalism developed on any campus in America — perhaps in the world.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the five decades since, the KCSB-FM radio station, La Cumbre yearbook and the Daily Nexus have made their homes at the base of the tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honoring this amount of history was no small task. According to Arai, almost a year was spent preparing for the semicentennial: “The thing that took the longest was to work with the two composers we commissioned to write new pieces for the event. I would say the resulting two pieces are one of the major successes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Golden Sounds,” by UCSB Professor Emeritus Emma Lou Diemer, was one of those pieces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I sat at the piano and held down the sustaining pedal to simulate the prolonged sounds of the carillon,” she wrote in an email, “and proceeded to write a piece that incorporated three different melodic elements and other musical ideas that are effective on the carillon.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second piece was “Fantasy on FIAT LUX” by world-renowned composer Aaron David Miller, which featured variations on the university motto “Fiat Lux” by the late Carl Zytowski, who was a UCSB professor of Music music for 44 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each letter of the motto spells out a musical theme which became the compositional material for the fantasy,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional pieces included “Piece Without Expression No. 1” by Frank Percival Price, “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” by Johann Sebastian Bach and “Fandango” by Ronald Barnes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instrument that made all of these performances possible was the carillon atop Storke Tower, which contains 61 bells and is one of only six such installations in California. It is played with fists and feet that strike a set of wooden keys each corresponding to a specific bell: the heavier the strike, the louder the sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The largest, lowest bells weigh up to 2.5 tons, while the smallest, highest ones can weigh as little as 13 pounds, so you need to be careful with the balance and not let the low bells totally bury the high bells,” Arai said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In principle, this is not too different from how someone would play a piano or an organ, but the similarities end there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes there’s a bit of trial and error, where something I arrange just ends up being impossible to play or doesn’t sound good on the bells and I need to rework it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these challenges, Arai, Diemer and Miller all agreed that the experience of playing a carillon is worth the learning curve, especially given the sweeping view of campus and the Pacific Ocean from atop Storke Tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is good to see and hear beyond and within one’s self,” Diemer wrote, and “it’s fun and exciting to create sounds with those 61 bells.” Miller invoked the concept of fun as well, writing that “I don’t know of another instrument you work up a sweat while playing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re by yourself, high up in the tower when you play, far away from any listeners,” and “at least for me, this can actually make performing somewhat relaxing, unlike if you were performing on a stage where you can see your audience staring at you,” Arai added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, more than the performance itself, and true to Storke Tower’s tradition of learning and community expression, passing on the knowledge of the carillon is the best perk that comes with playing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a bit more than just ringing the bells,” Arai said. Every quarter, he trains three students on how to play the carillon. “I think this is the most rewarding part, getting to work with enthusiastic, talented students and teaching them this very unique art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diemer agreed. “It all comes together sometimes: people, music, memories, creating, learning, never giving up, using one’s talents and perfecting them as much as possible, cherishing the marvelous gift of life, being thankful for all of that. But learning is probably the most important. Isla Vista is full of people who are doing just that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the event may be over, the celebration and education continue. The next carillon recitals will be held on Nov. 17 at 11 a.m. and Nov. 24 at 10 a.m. in front of Storke Tower. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-90612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The exhibit uses photographs, articles and other items from the university archives. <em>Katherine Swartz/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Located on the third floor of the Davidson Library, the exhibit uses photographs, articles and other items from the university archives to show the changes in UCSB’s academic reputation in the 75 years since UCSB joined the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Stahl, who became the first dedicated university archivist of UCSB in 2017, was in charge of designing and curating the exhibit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to pay homage to some of the institutions before, but there have been a lot of exhibits already in the library about the Anna Blake school and other preceding institutions. So we didn’t want to get bogged down in the pre-history of the institution,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exhibit is sorted by decade from the 1940s onwards. Some of the earlier decades include digitized copies of old photographs and poster copies of the El Gaucho student newspaper, which was an early iteration of what is now known as the Daily Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the other exhibits that we’ve done, they draw from … maybe one or two collections. For this one, I mean we have 130 different collections from just the university archives … Some of them are huge, some of them are just like one or two boxes, but I mean there was a lot more material to sift through,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had to make sure that it stuck with the story of the exhibit. And the story of the exhibit is how did this little sleepy beachside college grow from being a small liberal arts college to a world-class research leader. So we had to make sure that all the things we wanted to put in the exhibit related to that transition.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key element to UCSB’s transformation was the dissolution of the home economics department and the creation of the Black studies, Chicana and Chicano studies and environmental studies departments in the late 1960s. The shift in curriculum during the period was the academic response to the broader cultural change in UCSB’s student body during the time period, according to Stahl.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl notes through the exhibit a “crisis” of declining enrollment throughout the 1970s following the Bank of America burning and Isla Vista riots of 1970. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if our reputation [was] suffering, I think you can look at it best as growing pains, that the university was really trying to find its new identity and struggle with what kind of institution it’s supposed to be,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the first half of the exhibit — up to the 1970s — uses photographs and documents from that time, Stahl found there were less archival documents from the 1980s to now. Because there was no university archivist until Stahl was hired in 2017, departments and organizations were responsible for archiving their own work — which often was not properly preserved, if archived at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t have enough material necessarily to have a case for each decade,” Stahl said. “So we from this point changed it to research focus, like what have we done well in the field of research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three displays for the 1980s to the present include a dedication to achievements in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">science, technology, engineering and mathematics (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S.T.E.M.), one for research in the social sciences and humanities and a third displaying photos of UCSB’s six Nobel Laureates, along with a bronze duplicate Nobel Prize provided by former physics professor Walter Kohn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the modern exhibit section focuses on research, Stahl hopes that the exhibit will help UCSB student and faculty leaders understand the importance of archiving their work for future years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing I would have liked to have more of, for example, would be student organization materials in the exhibit. But we don’t have a lot of materials from [Associated Students] clubs and so basically student organizations don’t always know the best way to preserve their materials,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully this will kind of generate awareness there that if you’re a student organization on campus and you have historical records, we are willing and able to preserve them for you here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl and his team of curators — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special Collections Librarians David Gartrell and Yolanda Blue and Processing Archivist Leland Riddlesperger </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> strived through Campus by the Sea to not only focus on UCSB’s previous evolution into a research institution but also what lies ahead in the university’s future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The curators incorporated this element through photographs of current students on a wall in the exhibit. Students answered questions about how their university experience has shaped them and their hopes for the future of UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yolanda Blue noticed that as UCSB’s population continued to grow since it first became a UC, so has its reputation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus started as a small liberal arts campus, very small in concept and focus. And now, 75 years later, we’re known worldwide as a world-class research university. The growth – how the campus has transitioned over the years in spite of all the different events that have taken place,” Blue said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve acquired so many different departments and Nobel Prize winners … it’s inspirational, as you can tell from the comments made by the students that we interviewed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening reception for Campus by the Sea will be held on Thursday from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Special Research Collections area of the library on the third floor mountain side. An open house will also be held on Nov. 1 from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exhibit will be open on the third floor in the Special Research Collections until July and can also be viewed digitally through the Campus by the Sea website.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Not Pictured: ON-Campus Senator Ashley Davis. <em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These vacancies were created during the Spring Quarter 2019 Associated Student (A.S.) elections, after only three candidates ran for five on-campus seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The appointment of a College of Creative Studies senator marks the first time this seat has been filled in two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of the 70th Senate term in Spring Quarter of 2019, Internal Vice President Alli Adam created an ad-hoc committee to find and nominate students to fill the three vacancies. Instead of a general election, the three new senators were chosen through an application and interview process by the ad-hoc committee before being officially appointed this Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a huge accomplishment. Senates in the past have tried to fill seats to no avail, and the fact that you were able to fill the seats in week four </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marisela and I are very proud,” Adam said to senators during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Tianna White led the ad-hoc committee and announced in her report on Wednesday that the three senators have “fully met the standard” of legal code with eligibility. White took a “holistic approach” in the interview process for candidates, reviewing past leadership, involvement, project goals and what they plan to bring to Senate. </span></p>\n<p><b>On-Campus Senator Anvitha Aluri </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anvitha Aluri, a second-year biology major, was appointed for one of two vacant on-campus senator positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to just apply because I feel like there’s so many things on campus that I see my friends are talking about, what they wish could be better. And I feel like if I could kind of help bring some of their concerns forward too, that’s why [I applied].“</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her free time, Aluri volunteered at a local middle school students and at the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center. It was her volunteer experience there that showed Aluri the importance of resources for sexual assault survivors, something she plans to carry into her term by advocating for more resources for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E.) and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S.). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like if there was a better way of … being easier for someone just to come in or even anonymously talk to someone. I think it would make people feel a lot more safe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Aluri’s main concerns she finds with the university is the high price of on-campus housing. Aluri expressed that campus housing is more expensive than living off-campus, but for some students with scholarships, that is their only option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular element of Aluri’s on-campus housing initiative is changing the meal plan requirement for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They shouldn’t make you get a meal plan. I guess I kind of understand how they need to make people have meal plans, but they can also change the system to Gaucho bucks or something like that where I feel like it would just be as easy to use it rather than [being] forced to get a meal plan.”</span></p>\n<p><b>On-Campus Senator Ashley Davis </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Davis was first approached about running for senate by current off-campus senator Eric Moon during last year’s spring elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Davis, a second-year sociology major, felt her other commitments during her freshman year kept her from “doing a full election and campaigning.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis previously served as a desk attendant for San Nicolas residence hall, was a Real Talk facilitator for her residence hall last year, currently serves as a house manager for the Department of Theater and Dance, serves as the administrative vice president of the Residential Housing Association and is the external coordinator for the Queer Commission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I always had in the back of my mind as something that I’d be doing like my junior or senior year and not something that would happen this quickly,” Davis said. “But I really like the idea of being influential on campus, representing students that weren’t typically represented on this kind of scale.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis said she is still “getting [her] bearings and doing research” about what issues senators are already addressing, but she is “excited to get more information firsthand.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some issues she expressed an interest in are environmental justice and LGBTQ visibility and rights by working with the Trans Task Force and Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Personally, I hope that I can be an active member of the communities that I already participate in and an ally for those that I don’t.”</span></p>\n<p><b>College of Creative Studies Senator Daniel Mitchell</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Mitchell first considered running for an off-campus senate seat for the 2020-2021 term, until he heard from current on-campus senator Emma Swanson that a seat was currently open to represent the College of Creative Studies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Representing CCS seems like a lot cooler opportunity personally for me, especially to incorporate the artsy part of CCS into my A.S. work.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell, a second-year CCS music composition major, hopes to blend his passions for the arts and public policy to help CCS and Letters and Science artists collaborate on new projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell says he has a “passion” for public service and told senators that he grew up volunteering for political campaigns with his family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s this same element of teamwork that drew him towards being an A.S. Senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this is a good place to start because [UCSB] is a small community, but if I’m serious about running for other elected offices, I think this is a good way to start to get a sense of what legislating is like.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell hopes to run for Isla Vista Community Services District after he graduates and eventually State Assembly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was involved with Campus Democrats and Chamber Choir last year and currently serves with Lobby Corps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell’s two main goals for the year are expanding arts programming and environmental justice work. Some ideas he mentioned for arts events are creating a Isla Vista student band concert at Storke Plaza and bringing local artists to campus to hold workshops for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through spearheading initiatives for environmental justice, Mitchell wants to continue UCSB’s reputation of spearheading green initiatives. Mitchell hopes to work with the Coastal Fund to start beach cleanups after Deltopia, as well as planting more local trees around campus. </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [10/25 11:06 a.m.]: A previous version said it had been three years since the CCS Senator seat had been filled.
