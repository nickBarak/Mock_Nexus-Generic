Young has been at the university with the division of Student Affairs since 1990.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Affairs Debbie Fleming said Young and his wife have made positive and lasting impacts on the university and that Young will leave behind a legacy for vice chancellors in Students Affairs to come.</p>\n<p>“JoAnne has shared Michael with us for the last 25 years, so we are forever grateful to JoAnne and the entire family, many of whom are here,” Fleming said. “Michael Young’s values — honesty, transparency, integrity, collaboration and teamwork — are at the foundation of the positive and supportive community that we treasure at the Student Affairs Division.”</p>\n<p>Marina Quintanilla, a second-year biology major and a student assistant in Young’s office, said Young will be missed by students and staff alike.</p>\n<p>“It is going to be so sad going into the office and not seeing him everyday,” Quintanilla said. “We are used to seeing him meet with numerous people throughout the whole week and he is just very nice and very caring for the students and now that he is gone it is going to be the saddest thing ever.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, along with Assembly member Das Williams, presented Young with a framed resolution to recognize and honor his time with the university.</p>\n<p>“Not only has Michael demonstrated wise and experienced leadership in his position but he has launched countless initiatives that have become the models throughout the country in areas including creation of student wellness programs, an issue of great concern I know to all of us at this time,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Williams said Young has influenced the high voter registration campaigns and turnout at the university.</p>\n<p>“He made it a value,” Williams said, “He made a recognition of the administration that having students and faculty register to vote and participate in our government was an important value to have.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am very proud of what we have accomplished over the past quarter century, and I am proud of my role in all that, but the truth is that it is teams that win championships and it was and has always been the team that has made us successful. So the real and simple answer is that I am most proud of you. – Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young</p></blockquote>\n<p>Williams also said Young was a leader in the move to improve energy efficiency efforts on campus, including the Zero Net Energy Plan, an initiative to help ensure energy efficient spending at the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the implementation of the Zero Net Energy Plan, UCSB will be more energy efficient in the years to come and will be more instep with our values so that we are not creating as much human pain by the energy choices that we have as a community,” Williams said, “and that is because Dr. Michael Young thought it was important and helped move that forward.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Congresswoman Lois Capps, whose late husband Walter H. Capps was a professor on the committee that chose Young as Vice Chancellor, said Young has “enriched” the university throughout his career and his “noble work.”</p>\n<p>“Michael, how you touch the individuals, during that formative time in a person’s life, when they are a college student,” Capps said, “That translates into a wider community now.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Michael has treated me as an equal, demonstrating a confidence in me that I hadn’t realized myself yet. Michael supported and helped to instill the strength in me and the entire UCSB community that guided us through a very challenging chapter in our lives. – A.S. President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>Executive Director of Housing and Residential Services Willie Brown said Young was a constant role model to the African-American community on campus.</p>\n<p>“Michael has given his heart when a heart was needed for balance, when a heart was needed to even out the odds,” Brown said. “Michael has been a friend to anyone who needed a friend, he has connected those who have no connection.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Ali Guthy said she first met Young at the emergency response meeting following the shooting in May and that it was during that time that Young revealed himself as a pillar of strength for “the entire UCSB community.”</p>\n<p>“Michael has treated me as an equal, demonstrating a confidence in me that I hadn’t realized myself yet,” Guthy said. “Michael supported and helped to instill the strength in me and the entire UCSB community that guided us through a very challenging chapter in our lives.”</p>\n<p>Young said that among the things he has done during his time at the university, his development of a solar energy sustainability initiative, his support for the LGBTQIA community, his improvements in regard to mental health services and other projects are among those he is most proud of.</p>\n<p>“I am very proud of what we have accomplished over the past quarter century, and I am proud of my role in all that, but the truth is that it is teams that win championships and it was and has always been the team that has made us successful,” Young said. “So the real and simple answer is that I am most proud of you.”</p>\n<p>Young said the Student Affairs Division will be in good hands with current Senior Associate Dean of Enrollment Services Mary Jacob, when she fills his position after his official retirement on Jan 31.</p>\n<p>“Those of you that know Mary know that she is smart, she is committed, she has strict, great values, [and is] a strong person with even stronger principle values,” Young said. “I want to thank you all for being such great colleagues and friends. We have had some great times together working hard, debating, arguing, laughing, playing and I just want to thank you.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/","id":2920,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2919,2918,2917],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Arrest Suspect in Stabbing","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-bookingJPG.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-bookingJPG.jpg?resize=480%2C640&ssl=1","description":"A 21-year-old UCSB student was stabbed at the house of Sigma Chi Omega on the 6700 block of Sueno Road in Isla Vista about 2:45a.m, following an altercation just outside the house.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60082\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo.bmp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60082\" data-attachment-id=\"60082\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/police-arrest-suspect-in-stabbing/ruiz-booking-photo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo.bmp\" data-orig-size=\"480,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ruiz booking photo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo-188x250.bmp\" data-large-file=\"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo.bmp\" class=\"wp-image-60082\" src=\"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo.bmp\" alt=\"Kevin Ruiz.

The victim sustained knife injuries to the chest and head and was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital for treatment, where he is currently stable. Following the incident, Ruiz was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, a felony subject to up to four years in state prison and a maximum $10,000 fine, and bail has been set at $30,000.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega president and third-year psychology and economics major Jason Ouyang said Ruiz was heavily intoxicated and was accompanied by a “female accomplice,” both of whom approached the fraternity and demanded entry to a private gathering at the house.</p>\n<p>“We were having a small get-together, ourselves and our friends, and this person was not allowed entry into our house,” Ouyang said. “The guy was very aggressive and probably under the influence of alcohol … my brothers wouldn’t let him come in and he took that very personally and he tried to start a fight … he pulled out some sort of weapon and gave him a couple lacerations.”</p>\n<p>Sheriff’s Office officials denied requests for additional information on the incident.</p>\n<p>Ouyang said the incident was unprecedented and the fraternity never has issues keeping people from coming into private gatherings.</p>\n<p>“In this situation I guess that person wasn’t gonna take no for an answer,” Ouyang said. “Usually there’s never problems like this; this is the very first time something to this has occurred — its a little traumatizing.”</p>\n<p>According to Ouyang, the fraternity would gather in the next few days to assess the situation and focus on the group.</p>\n<p>“We’re all just kinda shaken by it but at the same time we can’t let that deter us,” Ouyang said.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega is a multicultural social fraternity and part of the Multicultural Greek Council on campus.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office is requesting that anyone with information contact Isla Vista Foot Patrol investigators at (805) 683-2724, or in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office, located at 6504 Trigo Road. Anonymous tips can also be provided via telephone, at (805) 681-4171.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

visitors, who flock to Isla Vista by the thousands annually for Deltopia (above), from parking in local communities. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The Goleta City Council decided to consider a plan on Tuesday to use parking permits to discourage out-of-town visitors from flooding Isla Vista during Deltopia this April, a method used in October to limit crowds during Halloween.</p>\n<p>Under the plan, parking permits for certain areas of the City of Goleta will be issued by mail and posted in the windows of residents’ cars during the weekend of Deltopia, taking place this year on April 4. The annual event typically attracts thousands of out-of-town visitors, whose presence creates parking issues for portions of the city over the weekend. The parking permits would be issued for neighborhoods south of Hollister Avenue between Cannon Green Drive and Storke Road to the city limits, the same area issued parking permits for Halloween.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Rob Plastino, Goleta City Council saw the damage and destruction caused by Deltopia last spring and is aiming to put preventative measures in place to keep I.V. safe.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how inconvenienced we or the residents of Isla Vista are, it all boils down to if everyone got home safe,” Plastino said. “That’s my number one concern is that you guys are safe.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said one of Goleta’s concern about Deltopia is the number of attendees expected to show up and how the city will protect its residents from the influx.</p>\n<p>“As a city, they are definitely concerned with an influx of outsiders flooding the city streets and potentially parking in front of people’s houses and now the people that live in those houses don’t have parking spaces,” Plastino said. “They’re looking at it as a city that needs to protect its residents, and it’s a good idea for them to do that because it would help us keep the outsiders to a minimum during Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said the parking permits would help deter outsiders from the event if available parking is minimal, and a decrease in visitors could mean less injuries and damage to I.V. and its residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s a concern of mine because my job is to make sure the public of Isla Vista is safe, and that means anyone in Isla Vista, whether that is outsiders or locals,” Plastino said. “I have to make sure that the property of residents remains as safe as possible too.”</p>\n<p>According to Goleta City Council Public Information Officer Valerie Kushnerov, an issue with permitting over Halloween was lack of adequate permits available per resident. Kushnerov said permits would be mailed out to an entire apartment complex rather than each unit, which left multiple residents without protection offered by the permits.</p>\n<p>Kushnerov said the city had undertaken preliminary research and action to ensure more residents receive permits in the event of restrictions.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already researched the area and updated our lists, so that the lists we give to the mail house will be more accurate next time,” Kushnerov said. “There will be additional costs because there’s more postage required to send out more permits, but those costs are minimal.”</p>\n<p>Kushnerov said although the rain could have been a major factor in Halloween’s low attendance, the council believes the permits could be very beneficial, especially with the citizens approval during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“Last year was an interesting year in terms of Halloween because of the rain, so we don’t have a great picture of what impact the parking permits played,” Kushnerov said. “What we do know is that our residents were very happy that the city put in place a program to help minimize impacts to their neighborhoods during Halloween and have asked the city council to continue the program for future events.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College fourth-year psychology major and I.V. resident Austin Thomas said parking is a major problem in I.V. even when there is no event on the weekend.</p>\n<p>“The streets near my house are always crowded, so at times it can be hard for me to find parking by my own house,” Thomas said. “It can get really frustrating because those people might not even be residents, but out-of-towners here for the weekend.”</p>\n<p>Thomas said he thought the use of parking permits would ensure that residents have guaranteed parking during Deltopia and will allow them to enjoy the festivities without worry.</p>\n<p>“I would feel better for the safety of my car and my house if I knew it was just residents parking in our neighborhoods,” Thomas said. “It would be a lot easier to enjoy Deltopia with that peace of mind.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate members talked over developing a new mental health program and continuing a 24-hour café, while President Ali Guthy clarified her proposal for a new A.S. Main Office entrance at last night’s meeting. <em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night in the Flying A Room where senators discussed various new developments and university projects.</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology major Ali Guthy discussed matters related to future programming at A.S. Program Board, a 24-hour café pilot program and plans to build a new entrance for the A.S. Main Office within the MultiCultural Center (MCC).</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, A.S. Program Board is making progress in creating long-term, alternative programming during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Program Board is working on doing some event planning for Deltopia, and kind of moving on to some sort of long term solution for programming during major Halloween, Deltopia and major events in the future,” Guthy said. “So more information on that will be coming relatively soon.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also tried to correct misconceptions about her proposal to build a new entrance for the A.S. Main Office.</p>\n<p>“The new entrance proposal. I know that an article came out in the <em>Nexus</em>. There were some inaccuracies in the understanding of where this would be,” Guthy said. “No student fees have been spent, no formal proposals have been made, but we’re looking into demolishing one of the A.S. President offices on the left side of the ticket office on the opposite end of the MCC.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also revealed an upcoming pilot program to test whether or not student demand exists for an on campus 24-hour café and announced a pilot program for the idea to occur at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>“We tried to reach out to the UCen to do more of like a large-scale pilot program but they really want to test the feasibility that students will actually use it enough to cover the cost of the program,” Guthy said. “What we’re planning to do is keep the Study Bean in the library open 24 hours during dead and finals week. That’s gonna be a test to see if that’s a service that students would want.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting A.S. Senator and fifth-year communication major Jimmy Villarreal said he is developing a mental health program that trains students to recognize distress signals among peers and to offer distressed individuals mental health help.</p>\n<p>“The idea of mental health first aid is that, like, what does normal first aid teach? You don’t know how to perform surgery on somebody, but if you see a problem you can address it right then, right there,” Villarreal said. “So eventually for this program we want to expand it to have as many students on campus as possible that can recognize [distress] before you’re really in trouble [and say], ‘Hey you doing okay?’”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Senator Matthew Santos, the purchase of a school supplies vending machine, which the Senate had previously passed a bill on, is currently in progress.</p>\n<p>“The issue that we’re working on for next week is starting a conversation with a specific company to purchase a vending machine,” Santos said. “The next step is identifying sources of funding… And we also wrote a list of the supplies that are a priority in including in this vending, things like blue books, green books, number two pencils.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the January, Thursday 22, 2015 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60012\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/senate-discusses-24-hour-cafe-mental-health-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60012\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/senate-discusses-24-hour-cafe-mental-health-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/senate-discusses-24-hour-cafe-mental-health-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/senate-discusses-24-hour-cafe-mental-health-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/senate-discusses-24-hour-cafe-mental-health-program/","id":2924,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2923,2922,2921],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVTU Fights for Evicted Tenants","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) announced the beginning of a campaign on Tuesday to provide required financial assistance to five households allegedly evicted from Abrego Villas on 6754 and 6764 A...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60001\" style=\"width: 664px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60001\" data-attachment-id=\"60001\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/tenants_lorenzo-basilio-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421917428\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tenants_Lorenzo Basilio-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60001\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-21-1024x682.jpg?resize=654%2C435\" alt=\"In August 2014, six households were served eviction notices at different residences on Abrego Rd by their landlord.

The eviction notices gave the tenants, all low-income long-term residents, 60 days to vacate the apartments, according to the Isla Vista Tenants Union.<em> Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) announced the beginning of a campaign on Tuesday to provide required financial assistance to five households allegedly evicted from Abrego Villas on 6754 and 6764 Abrego Rd. in Isla Vista this past October.</p>\n<p>Following the evictions, which were issued without justification by Abrego Apartments, LLC, under Van Nuys property owner Majestic Asset Management, LLC, the units in Abrego Villas were renovated and the rent was allegedly increased by over 50 percent, which made the units too expensive for former tenants to re-enter. These cases are the latest in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/tenants-removed-from-isla-vista-apartment-building-in-mass-eviction/\">a series of past evictions</a>, and under Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444, individuals evicted from households on County land are entitled to relocation benefits in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>In August, six households were allegedly served eviction notices by their landlord at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Rd., one in one building and five in the other. According to the IVTU, the eviction notices gave the tenants — all of whom were low-income, long-term residents, and many of whom were Latino families — 60 days to vacate the apartments.</p>\n<p>The tenants then contacted IVTU and an Associated Students Legal Resource Center and an IVTU-provided lawyer who then informed the tenants of the Ordinance 4444 violation potentially made by Majestic Asset Management, LLC, entitling them to benefits under county law. When the tenants presented their case to the property owner, Majestic Asset Management, LLC refused to grant them benefits and the tenants challenged the landowner over the amount in small claims court, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>According to the Advising Attorney at the A.S. Legal Resource Center Robin Unander, Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444 does not take effect in every situation.</p>\n<p>“The interesting thing about the ordinance is that it applies under very limited circumstances,” Unander said. “So what we’ve seen, because these property owners are not coming forward when they decide to make these changes is, they don’t tell the residents, ‘Oh guess what we’re gonna do all this, but we’re gonna offer you some relocation benefits.’”</p>\n<blockquote><p>This does affect the whole community. It’s not just these families, it’s the entire community. Many of them work full-time job and have kids in schools. Some of them had to move kids to new schools and find new jobs. — IVTU President Andrey Bogdanov</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unander also said each evicted household is entitled to up to $10,500 in benefits, paid by Majestic Asset Management, LLC, under Ordinance 4444.</p>\n<p>“We’ve made that known to Majestic and they said, ‘We’ll give them a $1,000 and a security deposit.’” Unander said. “So when we weren’t able to get past that in November or December when it stalled, we filed small claims.”</p>\n<p>However, Majestic Asset Management, LLC has taken the position that the Ordinance 4444 does not apply to them, Unander said.</p>\n<p>“Their position is based on the fact that, before the tenants vacated, the tenants were given 60 days notice,” Unander said, “and before the 60 days were up, before the tenants actually vacated, Majestic was made aware by me that this situation might exist.”</p>\n<p>According to IVTU President and third-year econometrics major Andrey Bogdanov, the property owners attempted to remedy the situation by canceling some evictions, but the effort came too late as the tenants had secured replacement housing by the time the offer was made.</p>\n<p>“Even if they were allowed to stay they couldn’t technically move back in because they can’t have two leases at the same time,” Bogdanov said, “or even if they could move back in, even if that was legally possible, they wouldn’t be able to afford the rent.”</p>\n<p>Representatives for Majestic Asset Management, LLC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>According to Unander, Majestic Asset Management, LLC evicted a select number of their tenants and made sure to do no renovations that required permits so as to not trigger the benefits enacted by Ordinance 4444. She also said that once the County became aware of what Majestic Asset Management, LLC was doing, the county ordered the company to cease until they acquired permits. However, the tenants had already signed permanent contracts to live elsewhere when the company offered them the chance to come back.</p>\n<p>“That’s one of the things that takes them out of the benefits,” Unander said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the housing market in I.V. is significantly saturated, allowing unexpected evictions to substantially alter the livelihoods of some residents, especially if they are low-income or have children, Bogdanov said.</p>\n<p>“This does affect the whole community. It’s not just these families, it’s the entire community,” Bogdanov said. “Many of them work full-time job and have kids in schools. Some of them had to move kids to new schools and find new jobs.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov also said the eviction timing has put a toll on tenants who have consequently had to struggle to find housing.</p>\n<p>“Because they weren’t evicted during the leasing season, in October it’s very difficult to find quality housing in,” Bogdanov said. “Six tenants may not seem like a large number, but since 2002 over 300 households have been evicted.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60000\" style=\"width: 725px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60000\" data-attachment-id=\"60000\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/tenants_lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421917242\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tenants_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11-1024x682.jpg?resize=715%2C476\" alt=\"The Isla Vista Tenants Union has recently undertaken a campaign to offer financial support to tenants that were evicted without notice last August.

The fraternity seeks to establish a chapter on campus to appeal to pre-med students, despite the presence of Mu Delta, a pre-existing pre-med fraternity that has been on campus since 2011, as well as Rho Psi Eta, UCSB’s pre-health sorority, established 2007.</p>\n<p>According to Amy Tsang, Vice President of PhiDE Recruitment and second-year biopsychology major, the fraternity is unique because it is the only co-ed pre-medical organization on campus, differentiating it from all-male Mu Delta and all-female Rho Psi Eta, and includes pre-medical and medical school students.</p>\n<p>“We’re unique to UCSB in the way that we have medical school fraternities, as well as pre-medical school fraternities,” Tsang said in an email. “This means we have a strong alumni network, as well as tied to medical schools across the nation!”</p>\n<p>PhiDE president and third-year cell and developmental biology major Mimi Xu said the fraternity provides members benefits after graduation from college, including assistance in choosing a specialty and finding residency training.</p>\n<p>“We hope this fraternity prepares premeds for medical school by offering many resources such as volunteering and internship opportunities, guest speakers, academic help, etc.,” Xu said in an email.  “We also hope members will create lifelong friendships with people who have the same goals and aspirations, and have a supportive network of people when things get tough.”</p>\n<p>According to PhiDE Vice President of Programming and second-year biology major Kevin Le, the new chapter will require 25 students to join to form the founding class, and there are tentative plans to hold the first rush in the fall quarter of 2015.</p>\n<p>“Students looking to join this fraternity should be ready for a challenge, but a worthwhile challenge,” Le said in an email.  “Joining a new fraternity on campus and building it up from the ground is definitely something that is not easy. However, the potential growth and lifetime bonds you could develop from doing so is what makes it worth it and so exciting.”</p>\n<p>Carl Provenzano, Inter-Fraternity Council president and fourth-year biopsychology major, said PhiDE will offer pre-med students a great way for students to get involved.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great to bring out groups that tend to different demographics,” Provenzano said. “And it’s coed and it targets the medical students. It is definitely official and it’s great that students can find a niche and get involved.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the January, Thursday 22, 2015 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60014\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60014\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/","id":2923,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[2922,2921,2920],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Possible Isla Vista Community Center Discussed","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Office of Assemblymember Das Williams held the latest in a series of conversations about Isla Vista self-governance this past Tuesday night in the I.V.

Seconds after units cleared the call, the roommate flagged down the IVFP officers in the street and stated that Michael B was brandishing a knife. After investigation, Michael B was arrested on a citizen’s arrest for brandishing a weapon and battery.</p>\n<p>During the course of the investigation, officers also learned Michael B had two legally registered rifles, a modified AK-47 and a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun in the house, which Michael B agreed to turn over to the officers for safekeeping. In addition, the roommate agreed to turn over his gas pistol to the officers for safekeeping.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the AK-47 had been professionally modified to fit legal California firearm standards and not function as an assault rifle, which has been prohibited in California since the 1989 approval of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing is that it fires single rounds at a time instead of automatic,” Plastino said. “It still fires a 7.62mm round, which is still the standard size round for an AK-47.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, because Michael B did not use the firearms in any act of violence nor give any indication that he would, he was not legally required to relinquish possession of his guns, although Plastino believes Michael B was correct to do so.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, the guy made a good decision,” Plastino said. “He made a thoughtful decision in allowing us to take his weapons from him because he didn’t have to. He committed a sort of violent crime, brandishing a knife, so he needs to cool off and calm down before we’ll return his weapons to him.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, law enforcement officers pulled over a vehicle with four juveniles and one adult inside during a routine traffic stop because the headlights were turned off while the car was in motion. The driver, a juvenile, was under the influence of alcohol, while two more passengers were intoxicated with alcohol and marijuana with the other two passengers in possession of cocaine. All subjects were cited and their parents called to pick them up. The legal adult, 18-year-old Michael Davis, was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail for possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p>Later on Friday night, at approximately 11:00 p.m., a female was approached and verbally assaulted by her ex-boyfriend, Carrington Cox, outside of 7-11. When the victim’s current boyfriend stepped in to intervene, a shoving match ensued, at which point Cox struck the victim’s current boyfriend in the face with a skateboard. Cox then broke free of the scuffle and ran towards his ex-girlfriend, stomping on her left leg and fleeing south on El Embarcadero. The female victim sustained a fractured tibia and extensive knee injuries.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, the Delta Gamma sorority requested extra patrol in light of the social media shooting rumors, during which officers noticed Santa Barbara City College student Joshua McKenzie Smith at an upstairs, outside door of the sorority house. Plastino said Smith tried the door to see if it would open and claimed to be trying to find the residence of his friend, Tom. He was then arrested for public intoxication and prowling.</p>\n<p>IVFP officers also noted that on Sunday there were more crowds out than a usual due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday, during which there were miscellaneous alcohol and noise ordinance citations issued.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59924\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59924\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/","id":4772,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4771,4770,4769],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Main Office, located inside the MultiCultural Center. The proposed entrance would allow entrance to the A.S. Office from the exterior of the building, unlike than the interior entrance that currently exists. <em>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Associated Students President Ali Guthy presented a proposal to create a new entrance to the A.S. Main Office in the MultiCultural Center (MCC) during <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/\">last week’s A.S. Senate meeting</a> in response to what she claims is student-need as described in the Vision 2020 A.S. Student Strategic Plan.</p>\n<p>The proposal, according to Guthy, is a response to the A.S. Student Strategic Plan released in Spring 2014, which laid out A.S.’s goals for the next five years. Under the proposal, the second floor of the outdoor MCC patio area will be changed to a conference room that will be predominantly used by A.S. officials.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year sociology and psychology major Guthy, there are plenty of reasons to have a new entrance, since she claims that the current space is “bunker-like” and “inaccessible” to students.</p>\n<p>“Although the association has done its best to advertise its location, the bunker-like structure inhibits open access to the space and its resources,” Guthy said. “Associated Students is funded entirely by students and serves to facilitate student needs. I find it troubling that this space isn’t readily open and accessible to all students, given that students are the ones paying for it.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many generations of students have been asking for greater accessibility to these spaces and such a change will benefit future students. – AS President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>MCC office manager Enma Elias however said that the idea of a new entrance is “nice,” but that MCC employees would like things to stay the same.</p>\n<p>“It definitely would be nice to see this proposal, but from what I know, we want to keep things the same,” Elias said. “Especially because the outdoor patio area outside of the MCC entrance is always used for conferences each summer and spring by people outside of UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Although the proposal has not been approved by Senate, Guthy said it will benefit future students, particularly student leaders, for informational purposes.</p>\n<p>“Future student leaders, over the next few years, could continue to contribute information to this space and feature information that they find necessary,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>MCC co-chair and third year film &amp; media studies major Ashley Baker said she opposes Guthy’s plan because Guthy did not ask for input from the MCC co-chairs.</p>\n<p>“I do not like the idea of this proposal at all. Ali did not have the courtesy to discuss this with [co-chair Anumita Kaur] and I, and I find that extremely unfair,” Baker said in an email.</p>\n<p>“As MCC co-chairs we should have been involved in the process of developing this idea as this construction will absolutely obstruct MCC affairs.”</p>\n<p>According to Baker, Guthy’s proposal, if acted upon, could obstruct other non-student government bodies from properly organizing.</p>\n<p>“The MCC is the only place that marginalized groups (people of color and/or LGBTQ) have to organize, study and have social/political gatherings,” Baker said in an email.</p>\n<p>However, Guthy said students have always had a specific demand for greater accessibility to the A.S. Main Office.</p>\n<p>“Many generations of students have been asking for greater accessibility to these spaces and such a change will benefit future students,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>According to Elias, the current lack of space on campus will only be exacerbated should plans for the new entrance come to fruition.</p>\n<p>“Corwin Pavilion has a patio right outside of our main entrance. Corwin needs their space as well and I don’t think they’d like that idea,” Elias said. “UCen lacks space too and all these building are near so it’s all relative: There’s a lack of space … It’s actually really cramped in here.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Productive for the privileged, but what about folks who are disadvantaged? – MCC co-chair Ashley Baker</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth-year film &amp; media studies major and MCC media designer A.J. Price said she also does not agree with Guthy’s proposal and plans to “vote against it for sure” if it is proposed to the student body.</p>\n<p>Second-year French and economics-accounting major and Democratic Process (DP) party senator Steven Kwok however said the new entrance would be beneficial because it would provide students with direct access to the A.S. Main Office and would thus allow students to be “more connected to their government.”</p>\n<p>“I think the new entrance to the MCC is a great idea,” Kwok said in an email. “The student body will be able to directly access AS through the entrance instead of having to enter through the hall that extends to the main corridor of the MCC. This gives AS a face to the outside beyond the lettering that is currently on the building.”</p>\n<p>Former Open People’s Party (OPP) senator and fourth-year political science major Marvin Ramirez said the university lacks student space and that students can benefit “greatly” from the new space should it be constructed.</p>\n<p>“Seeing as people out in I.V. are now charging students for their access to study spaces, spacing has been a large issue,” Ramirez said. “The university accepts more students which is awesome, but remains the same structurally inside. This cannot always be the case so a new conference room space may be of great value. Creating a new conference room that may potentially be a long-term investment is not a bad thing.”</p>\n<p>However, Baker said the proposal and conference room renovation is an example of what she alleges is elitist decision-making favoring “white and hetero-normative” OPP affiliates who she claims will not solve space issues that benefit people of color.</p>\n<p>“Productive for the privileged, but what about folks who are disadvantaged?” Baker said in an email. “Where are the fruits of their labor? We must note that the university was physically built and is still preserved by the muscle by countless economically deprived people of color. Look at how they have cornered El Centro with the library renovation.”</p>\n<p>According to Baker, enacting Guthy’s proposed renovation will continue to unevenly distribute space to a student group that has “more than enough.”</p>\n<p>“I do not believe this change to be necessary as they have more than enough space. Half of the university belongs to them. How inconsiderate can one be is my question?” Baker said in an email. “If this proposal is passed future generations will once again have to fight for an area that was already theirs.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59894\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59894\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/","id":2921,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2920,2919,2918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"March Decries Rape Culture in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students and Isla Vista residents, led by members of Sociology Professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani’s Introduction to Women, Culture, and Development (Soc 156A) class, marched down Del Playa Drive to bring at...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_59846\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59846\" data-attachment-id=\"59846\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2347%2C1562&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2347,1562\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59846 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Students and community members march down Del Playa Drive on Friday night to call attention to rape culture prevalent in Isla Vista and other college communities nationwide.

During the march, over 100 demonstrators walked from Little Acorn Park to Del Playa, then proceeded to walk up and down Del Playa chanting “End rape culture!” and “Consent is an enthusiastic yes!”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think most women who live in Isla Vista can relate to the discomfort and unease that can occur from any kind of sexual harassment. – Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund said Bhavnani, who is also Chair of the Academic Senate, prompted her students to organize an event that addressed what they felt were the most prevalent issues in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Immediately, rape culture surfaced as the biggest issue for all of us. Professor Bhavnani prompted us a little and we decided to do something about it,” said Westerlund. “The rest is history.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year anthropology and psychology double major Alexandra Ballinger, event participants felt that Friday’s demonstration was vital in order to bring attention to what many students see as an increase of sexual violence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was rewarding to be able to say publicly that there are actually people who care about this problem [and] so many people who know it’s unacceptable,” Ballinger said. “In a community where rape happens all the time, we don’t get a chances to say that enough.”</p>\n<p>Westerlund said the event helped shed light on issues regarding safety for women in I.V. and that turnout exceeded organizers’ expectations by amassing twice predicted amount of attendees.</p>\n<p>“I think most women who live in Isla Vista can relate to the discomfort and unease that can occur from any kind of sexual harassment,” Westerlund said. “The fact that this happens in Isla Vista makes this event really relevant to our community.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59842\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59842\" data-attachment-id=\"59842\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end “rape culture.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59842 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Participants walked the one-mile stretch while holding posters and passing out flyers that read “No excuse for rape. End rape culture.” According to Westerlund, event organizers intentionally staged the march on Del Playa in order to bring attention to sexual assault in an area that has historically typified what many students see as the party culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We planned the walk for DP on a Friday night in order to reach the target audience,” Westerlund said. “DP is always filled with students, often intoxicated, looking or headed towards a party. This group is especially at risk of rape, sexual assault or harassment. We wanted to bring the problem to light in its own arena.”</p>\n<p>During the demonstration, many students and I.V. residents cheered and clapped from their Del Playa balconies, high-fived participants or took videos of the passing crowd.</p>\n<p>Organizers invited students to participate in the demonstration via Facebook in order to facilitate discussion on rape culture in I.V., third-year sociology major and event coordinator Zoe Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>“This is an interactive event to help make known that there does exist in Isla Vista a rape culture and this we hope will provide a space where students can comfortably confront rape culture,” Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.]. To end the, ‘Well what was she wearing?’ and ‘Was she drunk?’ questions, and to end the society that makes these questions okay. – Third-year global studies major Claire Breen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year biology major Patrice Trowbridge said gender roles in I.V. play a large part in shaping the presence of rape culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“To me rape culture is every person that feels entitled to sex and every person that feels obligated to give it. And that’s so pervasive in I.V. The way we look at gender leads to rape but people don’t see that,” Trowbridge said. “Hopefully if we make it hard to ignore it will start some conversations.”</p>\n<p>According to Jonathan Gonzalez, a fourth-year political science major and Vice President of Sigma Lambda Beta fraternity’s local chapter, rape is just as much a male issue as it is a female issue and should be addressed equally by both sexes.</p>\n<p>“Instead of teaching girls to be careful and to watch their backs, we should be teaching the boys to not rape. Our current generation is the next generation of parents so it’s up to us to get educated and educate our boys and girls,” said Gonzalez. “Boys and girls were stopping their normal weekend partying to cheer and chant with us.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and Nu Alpha Kappa fraternity member Carlos Maldonado said rape culture is a topic that needs to be given immediate attention, especially within organizations that face controversy regarding sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“As a fraternity member, it is essential to be present at these important events so that we may raise awareness and establish accountability within our own organizations so that we do not perpetuate this culture,” said Maldonado.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59843\" style=\"width: 263px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59843\" data-attachment-id=\"59843\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end “rape culture.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-59843\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=253%2C168\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"253\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major Claire Breen, event attendees marched in order to empower others to participate in the local and nationwide movement toward ending rape culture.</p>\n<p>“I think that rape culture is horrifically prevalent not only in Isla Vista, but on all college campuses in the United States,” said Breen. “I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.].

Some of the committees on campus that were reported on include the Arts &amp; Lectures Advisory Committee, the Student Resource Building Governance Board and the Student Health Advisory Committee.</p>\n<p>According to the report, some changes being discussed include the possibility of the Student Resource Building (SRB) Governance Board renaming the SRB to honor retiring Vice Chancellor Michael D. Young. Other changes include the Student Health Advisory Committee’s upcoming notice to students that next year the distance criteria for Gaucho Health Insurance will be extended to include Kaiser Permanente patients within 50 miles, and that the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on Student Housing will release a report of a delay in the opening of the San Joaquin apartment projects.</p>\n<p>Cassie Mancini, second-year history of public policy major and chair of the Senate University Affairs Committee, said Gaucho Health Insurance was a big issue that many students discussed during meetings.</p>\n<p>“The limits of the distance requirement — that’s so prevalent,” Mancini said. “That was such a big issue and I know our committee reps have been pushing for it, so that’ll be good.”<br>\nMancini said another important issue for students concerns work currently being done by the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on the Status of Women and their student representative Danielle Maldonado.</p>\n<p>“Promotion of women and ensuring faculty and professors get promoted as often as men do and increasing women of color faculty on this campus, that’s a great issue that she’s [Maldonado] really pushing for,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, this was the first time A.S. published a shared governance report, in an effort to hold student representatives accountable and to spread the word on new things that are occurring on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said the report can be beneficial for students to know what is happening within administrative and advisory committees on campus.</p>\n<p>“Often there is only one student representative or voice in these spaces, and student participation is critical to fulfilling the mission of shared governance on our campus and throughout the UC system,” Guthy said in an email. “This report is a fantastic new way of ensuring student representation and awareness in all of these spaces.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said shared governance describes the collaborative efforts that are being made between students and staff on campus.</p>\n<p>“The faculty and administrators of the school and students, as well, sharing in university governance and policy-making,” Mancini said. “It’s kind of a concept very unique to the UC system … At the core, it’s like this real sharing of duties between administrators and faculty and we’ve kind of come to have students work with that too.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the report was compiled using feedback provided by student representatives who sit on different committees that were appointed by the A.S. Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>“We ask the students to be really critical of everything that’s said in the committee and make sure they’re sharing the student perspective because oftentimes in these committees there’s only one student there,” Mancini said. “So it’s super important that the students engage with the committee and really become a member of it to kind of share their voice in the committee.”</p>\n<p>Eve Kopecky, second-year English major and Shared Governance Coordinator for the Committee on Committees, said office hours will be held by the different committees and their representatives at the A.S. Main Office in the MultiCultural Center for students who have any questions about what is occurring on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to get up and going and started to be more proactive about shared governance,” Kopecky said. “So we’re really excited that everyone’s going to have their office hours and be able to just inform people, who they are and what they do.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A copy of the A.S.

The summit will also include various food-related workshops and activities as well as lectures by speakers such as food justice advocate Nikki Silvestri and renowned chef Crystal DeLongpré, also known as Food Network’s Chef Pink. The event will also feature a screening of “Occupy the Farm,” a documentary following food justice advocates.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Food Co-Op General Manager Melissa Cohen, the summit will allow attendees to become exposed to new ideas, solutions and innovations regarding food distribution and consumption that can prompt others to make positive impacts on the current food system.</p>\n<p>“People are bringing their expertise from projects they’re working on in their own communities and campuses outward so that kind of information can be shared and modeled,” Cohen said. “Because the best thing that can happen in a situation like this is people present projects that can be replicated.”</p>\n<p>According to Tim Galarneau, a member of the advisory board at Real Food Challenge, which is a campaign to shift the way universities source food, the summit is designed to be all-inclusive and allow all attendees to both learn and participate.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited to see a cross section of students, staff/faculty, and community partners coming together on MLK weekend to engage in conversations and planning toward bridging access, equity, and justice in our food system,” Galarneau said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Food Bank Chair and event organizer Katie Freeze said she is looking forward to listening to seasoned chefs and food advocates impart their wisdom upon event attendees.<br>\n“Summit participants will have the opportunity to enjoy meals prepared by local chefs, participate in educational workshops and listen to inspirational keynote speakers,” Freeze said.</p>\n<p>The summit will also include a series of talks and workshops designed to help attendees learn more about the food they eat, where it comes from and how to protect and conserve food resources. Workshops such as “Santa Barbara County Food Action Plan and Food Justice: Health, Access, Environment, Labor,” will take place in classrooms on the first floor of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Freeze said she hopes the summit will bring student attention to issues regarding the nation’s currently “broken” food system.</p>\n<p>“The summit’s primary mission is to start a dialogue surrounding food justice and food security in the UC community,” Freeze said, “and to help students realize the role they play in helping to fix our broken food system on a local and statewide level.”</p>\n<p>Keynote speaker Silvestri, who in addition to co-founding food justice advocacy campaign Live Real and directing national clean energy economy organization Green For All also developed a course curriculum for the UC system, has advocated statewide for environmental justice and political ecology programs for the last ten years. Cohen said she is particularly looking forward to the opportunity to hear Silvestri speak and hopes students will take advantage of the opportunity as well.</p>\n<p>“Nikki Silvestri is a huge person who influences me, helping me feel comfortable to have the right lexicon — the right words and the right knowledge — for how to talk about … these issues,” Cohen said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59814\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59814\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/","id":2931,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[2930,2929,2928],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Plan DP March Against Rape Culture","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C232&ssl=1","description":"Chair of the Academic Senate and Sociology Professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani, along with four students from her Introduction to Women, Culture, and Development (SOC156A) class, plan to march up and down Del ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Chair of the Academic Senate and Sociology Professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani along with four students from her Introduction to Women, Culture, and Development (SOC156A) class plan to march up and down Del Playa Drive Friday night to bring attention to rape culture in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Participants will begin marching from Acorn Park at 10 p.m., are encouraged to wear “party clothes” and will be given posters and signs with slogans made specifically for the event. The walk aims to address issues regarding sexual assault and gender stereotypes in I.V.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major and event organizer Diana Figueroa said the event idea first came about when Bhavnani invited students from her SOC156A class to discuss issues regarding I.V. with her over dinner.</p>\n<p>“We were like ‘You know what? It would be cool if we had a march to show people in I.V. who are in the party scene that rape culture exists,’” Figueroa said.</p>\n<p>According to Figueroa, the main goal of the march is to draw attention to sexual violence, especially against women, and its prevalence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We really want people to start the conversation, but we don’t only want discussion, we want action,” Figueroa said. “We want other people to make a stand and do something about it … We want this event to start a catalyst of other events about rape culture and see this issue gain more attention.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Akshaya Natarajan said she is looking forward to participating in the march and thinks it is vital to shed light on cultural practices in I.V. that promote— instead of combat — instances of sexual violence or harassment.</p>\n<p>“As a first year, I don’t have much experience with people and the direct effects of rape culture, but it’s easy to see the direct effects with people using rape as a slang term and unnecessarily catcalling women in the street,” Natarajan said. “I think the march on DP is really cool and I’m excited to go.”</p>\n<p>Demonstrators plan to march on Friday at 10 p.m., when parties typically occur and when Del Playa is generally crowded, in order to make a statement that aims to strongly impact students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“Rape happens more commonly during parties where people are intoxicated, and marching on Del Playa, where the most amount of parties occur with the highest amount of people, will be confronting the problem where it happens most,” Figueroa said. “It will be spreading the message to everyone that this stuff happens and it can happen to anyone partying out there.”</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan, marching on Del Playa will send a powerful message to students and I.V. residents occupying parties on the oft-crowded streets Friday night.</p>\n<p>“I think that they’re doing that on DP on a Friday night will really have a lasting effect,” Natarajan said. “It’s a bunch of people walking together, making a stance and calling people out who participate in rape culture. I don’t know how it will turn out — there’s always risks walking in a big group on DP, but I think it will be powerful one way or another. ”</p>\n<p>Figueroa said she expects to have a couple hundred people attend, however according to her the significance of the event should not be measured by how many people participate, but rather by the march’s impact on students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t really matter how many people walk with us so long as people see us and see what we’re standing for and what we’re talking about,” Figueroa said. “And this hopefully starts dialogue among other people while they’re out partying and remind them that this stuff happens when people do party.”</p>\n<p>According to Figueroa, fear of sexual assault or harassment should not be an issue in I.V., as individuals should feel secure in their neighborhood.</p>\n<p>“I think at the end of the day, we just want women to feel safe going out,” Figueroa said. “We want men to realize that they play an important role in rape culture and that we need their help in ending rape culture as well. Unfortunately it exists and we have to teach people not to rape and warn women about the dangers of going out and dressing a certain way. It shouldn’t be an issue.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator and a second-year physics major Liam Stanton said it is “incredibly important” that issues regarding sexual violence and harassment are addressed by “everyone in the UCSB and Isla Vista community, male, female, or otherwise.”</p>\n<p>“As a Senator, I particularly view it as one of my first responsibilities to support any movement seeking to combat rape culture and its implications in society, especially given the events which have historically plagued our community,” Stanton said.</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan, students are ultimately responsible for stopping the abuses associated with rape culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Rape culture starts and ends with the students,” Natarajan said. “UCSB can implement all the rules they want but there’s still an underlying problem, and we need to make a stand.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

self-governance. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students, faculty and Isla Vista residents met at the Isla Vista Clinic on Embarcadero del Mar yesterday to discuss the history of I.V. as well as problems facing the I.V. self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>The event was co-organized by volunteer group Isla Vista Collective, I.V. Coalition and individual residents, students and academic staff. I.V. Coalition member and comparative literature graduate student Shari Sanders led the meeting, inviting participants to list “trials and triumphs” in I.V. history, including the creation of the I.V. Food Co-op, the I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), I.V. Elementary School and the maintenance of I.V.’s many parks. Other points of I.V history discussed included episodes of violence, sexual assault and what some alleged as the increasing presence gentrification in I.V.</p>\n<p>Last year, Chancellor Henry T. Yang established the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on I.V. in order to increase the university’s presence in the campus’s neighboring college town.</p>\n<p>According to physics professor Harry Nelson, who is also a member of the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on I.V., there could be problems facing the university if administration tries to intervene in the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“Spending money from the University of California, not just UCSB, but the entire University of California on a thing like Isla Vista is a very hard thing to do it turns out, at least with public money,” Nelson said. “Every time you think you have an idea, there’s a vetting process, and a consideration, until someone says, ‘You know, local government is the responsibility of something else in California’s organization, not universities.’”</p>\n<p>As a public university, UCSB faces regulatory and monetary issues that differentiate it from schools with different funding models, Nelson said.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is not a private institution. If we were Stanford it would be totally different,” Nelson said. “There’s totally fewer regulations and requirements. UCSB being public, we have a lot of extra responsibilities with public money.”</p>\n<p>Nelson also said there are a great deal of alumni who feel passionately about I.V. and could potentially contribute to improving it.</p>\n<p>“One thing that’s interesting about Isla Vista is that over the past 50 years, maybe 4,000 students have come through each year,” Nelson said. “You do the math, that’s 200,000 people out there, predominantly in California, who universally love Isla Vista. That’s a very interesting phenomenon that’s never been tapped into.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Constance Brown said she is concerned with the ever-growing population of youth in I.V., a trend that she said she has seen over the past several decades.</p>\n<p>“It’s an undercurrent that, if not corrected, I simply have no hope for I.V. And that is, we used to have some hundreds of mature adults living in single-family homes,” Brown said. “And they used to be maybe professionals, two people, families, but they were stable adults.”</p>\n<p>According to Brown, an older demographic of I.V. residents would balance out the “craziness” caused by the large population of youth in I.V., a phenomenon she alleges has steered I.V. “out of control.”</p>\n<p>“They’re [older residents] virtually gone. There are a handful of us left. But all of those family homes that were a buffer, that created stability, they’re all filled with young people,” Brown said. “You see really nothing but young people out there, and they’re crammed in. Once Isla Vista is wall-to-wall young people, I don’t see any hope for Isla Vista. You cannot contain that amount of young people, all they see is other young people. It’s like Lord of the Flies.”</p>\n<p>In addition, fourth-year global studies major and IVRPD Board of Directors member Jacob Lebell said parking congestion might create a climate detrimental to residents if I.V.’s population continues to increase.</p>\n<p>“I think what kind of gives people permission to act without rules in many ways is that with parking impacted how it is, a lot of I.V. has the feeling of a parking lot and I think that sets kind of the mindset and the environment that a lot of people are acting in,” Lebell said. “It’s a place to kind of put things. That isn’t community space.”</p>\n<p>The meeting was part of an ongoing conversation regarding the I.V. self-governance movement that began <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/\">last Spring</a>. Future meetings will continue to be held the third Thursday of every month in the I.V. Clinic building.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/community-examines-history-of-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/community-examines-history-of-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/community-examines-history-of-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/community-examines-history-of-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/community-examines-history-of-i-v-self-governance/","id":4798,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4797,4796,4795],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":130,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
