The changes to the psychology degree are a “reflection” of how the discipline has developed in recent years, she said.</p>\n<p>“The change in degree is meant to benefit students, giving them a competitive edge in their further studies, careers and research,” Mackie said. “We wanted to create a new degree more biologically based and rooted in science.”</p>\n<p>The biology courses offered for the psychology department are different than the courses offered for the biology major, she said.</p>\n<p>Mackie said the old degree did not provide adequate training for modern psychology. The changes were not prompted by financial issues. The current psychology and brain sciences faculty are experts in the biological side of psychology, so the university won’t need to hire new professors.</p>\n<p>Some first-year students, however, are wary of the changes.</p>\n<p>Kellie Stahlhuth, a first-year undeclared major, said she planned to get a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology at UCSB and pursue a career in psychology after graduation, but is now unsure if the offered Bachelor of Science degree is the best way to achieve her goals.</p>\n<p>“The other UC campuses and most other universities in California still have a psychology B.A., in addition to the fact that it was a popular degree [at UCSB],” she said.</p>\n<p>However, Carly Wilcox, a fourth-year psychology major, said as she nears the end of her time at UCSB, she would have appreciated a Bachelor of Science degree to diversify her classes.</p>\n<p>“I would have liked the B.S. when I was an incoming freshman personally… but it might be nice if the department offered both,” Wilcox said. “I took Statistics and Math 34A, but other than that the classes for my major have been strictly psych classes.”</p>\n<p>When the old degree was still in effect, the department received approximately 300 applications per year from incoming freshmen seeking a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology.</p>\n<p>This past fall, there were approximately 200 freshman applicants to the new Bachelor of Science degree.</p>\n<p>Mackie recommends all psychology majors, even those who may not be as S.T.E.M.-oriented as others, to still pursue the Bachelor of Science degree because they will receive a more well-rounded psychology education.</p>\n<p>Mackie said students planning on pursuing a career in clinical psychology are given the education they need, while also benefiting students seeking work in medical and research fields.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

goals. He said he chose to apply because he believes in I.V. self-governance and hopes to bring his experience in advocacy, lobbying, fundraising and “navigating bureaucracies” to the district.</p>\n<p>“I want to be general manager to make sure that the CSD is successful in its first year in establishing itself, establishing its role in the community, making relationships built in the community and having a good reputation as a voice for change and good change in I.V. and I feel like I am well-suited to do that,” he said in a phone interview with the <em>Nexus </em>Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Abboud, a 2014 UC Santa Barbara alumnus, also plans to strengthen the district’s finances and find an independent revenue stream.</p>\n<p>He was a primary organizer for Isla Vista self-governance and directed the Yes on E &amp; F campaign for board elections in the CSD.</p>\n<p>The CSD will pay Abboud $4,000 from its professional development fund and may pay more based on his success in acquiring grants, according to a press release.</p>\n<p>Board member Spencer Brandt said the CSD plans to hire a full-time general manager when the district receives additional funding.</p>\n<p>In February 2016, the Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative estimated the general manager salary would be $162,500. In March, before a tax to fund the CSD failed, First District Supervisor Das Williams estimated the salary for a General Manager position would cost $100,000 annually.</p>\n<p>“The I.V. CSD has acquired a general manager at 6 percent of cost estimated in the 2015 Isla Vista Governance Options Financial Analysis Study,” Brandt said. “We are proving that we can do a lot with a little.”</p>\n<p>At a press conference Wednesday afternoon at People’s Park, Bertrand said the general manager’s role will be to execute the board’s policies, but ultimately it is the board’s duty to create policies, develop procedures and oversee finances.</p>\n<p>Bertrand added that the CSD is drafting a contract for the general manager’s role. The CSD’s lawyer, G. Ross Trindle, said the contract will become public when the details have been negotiated and finalized.</p>\n<p>The CSD hired Abboud through his consulting company which he created Sept. 17, two weeks after the application deadline for the position, according to California state records. He is the only employee of the firm and said he created the company so he could accept the position as general manager.</p>\n<p>According to Trindle, the district’s revenue stream would be unable to support salaries and benefits for a public employee. And, because it can’t sustain a payroll system, the CSD hired its general manager through a firm.</p>\n<p>“Having an Interim General Manager on a contract basis via a consultant allows the District to receive the general manager services it needs to function more efficiently to deliver much-needed services to District residents,” Trindle said in an email.</p>\n<p>In a Tuesday press release, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand praised Abboud’s service to I.V. and called it “an honor” to have him as general manager.</p>\n<p>Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday that there were only two applicants to the position, Abboud Consulting, LLC and Lechowicz &amp; Tseng Municipal Consultants, LLC – an Oakland consulting firm formed in March, according to state records.</p>\n<p>Lechowicz &amp; Tseng requested “significantly more” pay than what Abboud requested, Bertrand said, though that fact did not impact the decision since, ultimately, the group removed themselves from the applicant pool.</p>\n<p>The government consulting firm removed itself from the pool after the beginning of the application review process. Bertrand said the group was more focused on finances and strategic planning than the “general management” of the district.</p>\n<p>Abboud said his firm has no clients but has previously worked in acquiring grants and helped the CSD apply for a $20,000 grant with the James S. Bower Foundation.</p>\n<p>Abboud is currently on the board of directors for the Isla Vista Community Development Corporation, an I.V. nonprofit that coordinates funding for the CSD.</p>\n<p>When asked whether this influenced the decision to hire Abboud, Bertrand said he is not legally allowed to speak on the deliberations for a general manager.</p>\n<p>Bertrand also said the CSD plans to release over 100 pages of documents from the application and review process.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the main focus he has for the CSD is to envision its future and lay down a plan for what is to come.</p>\n<p>At Wednesday’s conference, he said his plan was never to stay in I.V. after completing his undergraduate degree, but instead to “do something more traditional.” However, the creation of the CSD drove him to remain in I.V. in order to make it a better place.</p>\n<p>“That’s been the most proud work of my life that I’ve worked on, and it’s such a joy to now be able to have worked on creating this district and now to be able to work on executing the district’s vision,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p><em>Updated Oct. 12, 12:30 a.m.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Community Services District (CSD) legal counsel Ross G. Trindle told the board on Sept. 12 that the California Supreme Court’s ruling in the<i> California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland</i> case could be interpreted to allow citizens to bring a tax to the board.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tim Bittle, director of legal affairs for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and representative for representing Upland in the case, said his<b> </b>group filed a petition in Sept. to make sure the court’s decision did not “open the door to abuse” from local governments, considering how “confusing” the court’s opinion is.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As of Tuesday night, the California Supreme Court has not clarified its decision. The deadline to respond to Bittle’s group is Nov. 26.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If the court agrees with Trindle’s assessment, local governments would<b><i> </i></b>be able to bypass the two-thirds requirement for special taxes.<i> </i>For this to happen, citizens must create an ordinance, gather 10 percent of voters’ signatures and bring the proposal to the county for approval.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If the county approves it, governments would either vote on the tax at a board meeting or an election with a smaller majority than normally required.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Legal experts are skeptical whether the court’s current ruling allows governments to leave some voters out of the decision-making process.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The majority of I.V. Community Services District (CSD) board members have rejected the possible use of this legal quirk to pass a tax.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">George Thurlow, a board member, told the <i>Nexus</i> that he cannot take a position on the tax because of his position as both a UCSB employee and an elected official. He added that he has recused himself at every opportunity to discuss the tax.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Directors Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Bob Geis, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan have all said they disapprove of passing the tax through a vote of the board. Brandt called it “a very clear no.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Director Geis said he is in favor of a user utility tax, but it is not an issue for seven people to determine. He said that “if it’s not the will of the voters,” they would be very displeased with such a decision.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would say that we would want to, in any circumstances, bring it to the voters,” Geis said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In a third-party assessment of the case, the League of California Cities said local tax measures proposed by citizens should be open to the same requirements as those proposed by a local government. The group provided their review of the case to the courts in October of last year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The group recommended that cities in similar situations should “consult with their city attorney” due to the “lack of clarity” in the court’s decision.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Legal experts in the county are currently keeping an eye on the issue but have yet to analyze it in detail due to its tentative nature.</p>\n<p>Mike Ghizzoni, legal counsel for the county of Santa Barbara, said he has read the case and is monitoring it but will not provide analysis until the petition has been granted or denied and the case is finalized.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

President Donald Trump announced on Sept. 3 that he intends to promptly repeal the program afterward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though many undocumented students have spoken vehemently against Trump’s repeal, Islas</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actually glad the administration is repealing the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The repeal is a “wake-up call” to undocumented youth that DACA was never permanent, said Islas, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth-year history of public policy major at UCSB</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said students can now begin to address flaws in immigration legislation and focus on the rights of the entire undocumented community, not only students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Other than just fighting for undocumented students, we need to be fighting for all undocumented individuals in this country,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thursday renewal deadline is only for DACA recipients whose applications expire on or before March 5, 2018. The administration may not announce an extended deadline for the undocumented youth whose applications expire after that date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas’s application expires after the March deadline and she said she may not renew her application if an additional renewal date is scheduled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t favor DACA,” she said. “It’s this whole complacency that’s taken part within the community. We just forget about other people’s struggles and other people’s narratives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former President Barack Obama signed DACA into law with an executive order in 2012. Since the program’s introduction, the UC has admitted thousands of recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 800,000 young people in the United States are DACA recipients and approximately 4,000 undocumented students attend a UC campus, according to the UC Office of the President.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas said she understood the benefits of DACA when she began school at UC Santa Barbara and was hired for an on-campus job. She said, however, that she still lives in “a constant state of fear” because DACA does not protect all members of her family, including her mother.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coming from someone who has an undocumented mother, I worry more about her than I worried about myself,” Islas said. “DACA never protected my mom and that was my biggest concern.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution Tuesday in support of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DACA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supervisors Janet Wolf, Joan Hartmann and Das Williams were the resolution’s staunchest supporters; supervisors Steve Lavagnino and Peter Adam, however, abstained from voting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Hartmann said while the resolution was primarily a symbolic gesture, she believes symbols are “vitally important” for local communities to impact the federal government’s policies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the resolution was a statement that the County values our Dreamers and we have a welcome sign at the door,” Hartmann said in an email. “They should know that we want to invest in their futures because they are critical to the County’s future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security on Sept. 8 in response to President Trump’s repeal of DACA. Napolitano alleged that the “unlawful” repeal violated the rights of the people that benefit from the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC also allocates $2.5 million per year for undocumented student fellowships under Napolitano’s D.R.E.A.M. loan initiative, and grants the UC’s Undocumented Legal Services Center $900,000 per year under the Undocumented Student Services Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States Supreme Court recently turned down a case challenging the UC Regents’ decision to allow undocumented students access to financial aid and pay in-state tuition fees in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Trump has given the DACA repeal to Congress, which can suggest a replacement for DACA in six months before the president officially abolishes the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas said while she does not trust Congress, the best form of a new system for the undocumented community would include an updated D.R.E.A.M. Act without the enforcement of border security and detention centers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some safety coming from legislation would be abolishing detention centers,” Islas said. “But I don’t believe the liberation of the undocumented community comes from a piece of legislation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure there’s something that’s viable that protects the 11 million [undocumented immigrants],” she added. “It’s not impossible.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/","id":2367,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2366,2365,2364],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Goings-On in I.V.

In the end, it has to pass through the state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The resolution was the first item on the agenda at the senate’s first meeting of the year and was authored by senators Dhishal Jayasinghe and Andrea Reyes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Tuition [that is] free is not a ridiculous idea,” Reyes told the <i>Nexus </i>on<i> </i>Tuesday. “It’s something that is possible in our state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Reyes is a transfer student and said the cost of a public university was the primary reason she chose to attend a community college before coming to UC Santa Barbara. She said, however, that she believes even the cost of community college can be a financial burden for many students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Spencer Brandt, one of the resolution’s student sponsors, said in a changing world and economy, the state must invest in higher education and not only fund K-12 education.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s important to have [senate’s] support to continue the movement for free college in California and gather momentum at the grassroots level,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Davidson told the <i>Nexus</i> on Tuesday he planned to attend a community college after high school because of its affordability, but his father encouraged him to attend UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He reminded the senate at the meeting that a UC, California State University and community college education was originally free. He said he believes the current political climate of instability presents students with an opportunity to make important changes at the higher levels of government.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is the moment that we seize on,” Davidson said. “This is the moment that we can truly make a better future for not just ourselves but for the people who will be coming here years down the road.”</p>\n<p><em>Anjalie Tandon contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The new charging stations, installed in parking lots 58 and 59 for the San Joaquin Apartments and Santa Catalina Residence Halls, are exclusively for UCSB-owned vehicles.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The university currently has 28 charging stations for faculty, student and visitor use in parking lots 10, 18, 22 and 60. In addition to the electric chargers, there are 34 stations on campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Each two-space charging station costs approximately $10,000, according to James Wagner, program manager for transportation and parking services. The university pays an additional $250 per year for each space in network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The university may also install charging stations in parking lot 31 at the end of the calendar year after assessing the total costs of the project.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Many university staff and faculty members charge their vehicle while at work if they do not have an electric car charger at home.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Rates for the charging stations vary depending on their location and power level. Level one is the most basic power level and level two is six times as powerful as the first level, Wagner said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Level one power is $1 for every four hours, with a 12-hour maximum. Level two power costs $1 per hour with a 10-hour maximum in most parking structures. Level two power in Lot 60 costs $0.20 per kilowatt hour.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the university primarily relies on grants to fund the charging stations.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Organizations such as the California Department of Energy, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District and the Green Initiatives Fund of UCSB provide the funding.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The vehicle charging stations are not a source of revenue for the university, Wagner said, adding that the fee users pay to charge their vehicles is distributed to the stations’ maintenance, payment processing fees and the network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB housing and dining services installed the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in Lots 58, 59 and 60.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the charging station installation process does not take longer than a week, especially if the underground wiring is already in place.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to data collected by the university’s transportation and parking services department, the use of electric energy has steadily increased since they were first installed in 2012. This year, approximately 125 megawatts hours (MWh) were distributed by the electric vehicle charging stations.</p>\n<p>According to the California New Car Dealers Association’s quarterly report released in May 2017, 4.8 percent of new vehicles registered in California in the first three months of 2017 were zero-emission vehicles and plug-in hybrids.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Correction: </span><span class=\"s1\">The university pays $250 per year in network connection fees, not electric connection fees, as the article previously stated. The article was also

id=\"caption-attachment-78989\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">While the SB fire department typically gets 15 to 20 fire alarms per month, they were alerted to 12 fire alarms in a 10-day period at the beginning of Fall Quarter. / Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Twelve fire alarms went off between Sept. 24 and Oct. 3, according to Mike Eliason, SB Fire spokesperson. On average, the fire department typically responds to 10 to 15 fire alarms per month.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said the fire department responded to 51 calls on campus and in Isla Vista in the same time period, 39 of which were emergencies and 12 of which were alarms.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said the increase in alarms could be attributed to the increase in people using campus facilities, although there is no “long-term discernible pattern” as to why alarms go off as often as they do. According to Eliason, most calls happen on Friday and Saturday night in I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said fire alarms are often triggered in various ways. One fire crew member claimed a spider had even triggered one alarm.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There have been times where literally a spider crawls up inside and sets off a sensor,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fire department responded to two calls provoked by the smell of dust from a construction site on campus Tuesday. During the school year, alarms are often set off by burnt popcorn or rice in communal kitchens.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There are more people using hot plates [and] making microwave popcorn than in the summer,” Eliason said in an email. “Take for instance yesterday’s call with the dust. In the summer, someone might not have been there (as it turned out) to pull the alarm.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The only damage in these situations is “slight embarrassment” for the person who pulled the alarm, Eliason said, but it is best to be cautious.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We do not mind responding to these calls, that is why we are here, to serve the public. We send a lot of resources to calls, because we can always turn them back if they aren’t needed,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said pulling false fire alarms “very rarely occurs” at UCSB. Pulling a false fire alarm in California is a felony and can include a punishment of imprisonment, a fine of no less than $500, no more than $10,000 or both, according to state law.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Annual Fire Prevention Week is Oct. 8 to 14 and the county fire department’s focus this year is preparation, according to Eliason.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Every second counts in a fire, he said, and can “mean the difference between residents of our community escaping safely from a fire or having their lives end in tragedy.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To prevent fires, the county fire department recommends drawing a map of one’s home and marking two exits for each room, as well as a path outside.</p>\n<p>In the event of a fire, the fire department also recommends closing doors while evacuating a building since it can possibly slow down the spread of smoke, heat and fire. Numbers on your home’s apartment should be clearly marked so firefighters may easily locate a fire when it occurs.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79001\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79001\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/","id":2364,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2363,2362,2361],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Detective Joins IVFP Following  Student Protests, Demands","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gutierrez was assigned to IVFP because of his work as a detective in the Criminal Investigations Division for one year, according to Hoover.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A full-time detective with specialized training in sexual assault investigations joined the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on Tuesday, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>Detective Julio Gutierrez is bilingual and has worked with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) for two of his 12 years in the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), according to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover. Gutierrez was assigned to IVFP because of his work as a detective in the Criminal Investigations Division for one year, according to Hoover.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (CSD) recently considered hiring a specialized sexual assault detective for as much as $120,000. The board members addressed the issue during a Sept. 12 meeting, during which they discussed expanding UCSB’s Community Service Organization (CSO) escort program.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"width: 700px; min-height: 500px; border: 1px solid grey;\" src=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/interactives/charts/IV_Crime_Stats.html\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Phi Do/Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During the meeting last week, CSD board chair Ethan Bertrand said he spoke with UCPD Police Chief Dustin Olson about a potential new hire. Bertrand said IVFP was not meeting an adequate “service level” in addressing sexual assault issues prior to Gutierrez’s hire.</p>\n<p>UCSB students agreed last May when <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">over 100 students crowded Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office demanding a reform</a> of the way sexual assault cases were handled.</p>\n<p>Ro’Shawndra Earvin, a UCSB student, said during the May sit-in that IVFP poorly handled her rape case. IVFP told her that they couldn’t respond to her allegations because it was out of their jurisdiction, Earwin said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand told the <em>Nexus </em>on Wednesday that the CSD will probably wait to hire a new detective until they decide whether sexual assault cases are now being handled properly.</p>\n<p>The CSD is also considering expanding UCSB’s CSO escort program to provide more service to I.V. during high traffic nights.</p>\n<p>The cost of the escort program expansion was originally $120,000 of UCSB’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-06/ucsb-pledges-1-4-million-to-isla-vista-self-governance/\">annual $200,000 pledged to the CSD</a>. Bertrand said the cost of the program is likely closer to $45,000, creating room for a new hire.</p>\n<p>SBSO will continue to pay Gutierrez’s salary through the Criminal Investigations Division, the department from which he is transferring. <a href=\"http://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2016/santa-barbara-county/julio-c-gutierrez/\">According to public records</a>, Julio Gutierrez received $206,711 in total pay and benefits in 2016.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78886\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78886\" data-attachment-id=\"78886\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/ivrpd-looks-to-fill-board-vacancy/detective11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?fit=2048%2C1364&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1364\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Detective1(1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78886 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78886\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julio Gutierrez (second from left) has specialized training in sexual assault cases. <em>Courtesy of Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div>\n<p>On the timing of Gutierrez’s appointment in relation to the CSD’s plans, Hoover said the Sheriff’s Office has wanted to create the assignment for “quite some time” but said she could not specify when the move was first considered and that SBSO has been “involved in all of these discussions” about public safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>IVFP is a partnership between sheriff’s deputies and UC Santa Barbara police officers (UCPD) created in 1971 that patrols I.V. on foot or bicycle.

The university released the current version of G.O.L.D. in the beginning of 2006, and the website has not undergone changes since its launch.</p>\n<p>The new updates will make the website more compatible with mobile phones and alter the color scheme and design to align with other websites, such as the official university <a href=\"https://www.ucsb.edu/\">website</a>, which is clearer and more modern than the current G.O.L.D. site.</p>\n<p>“We made attempts to make it look and feel like a UCSB site. Right now, it’s kind of its own thing,” said Anthony Schmid, the Associate Registrar for Information Systems.</p>\n<p>Schmid said the Registrar has been working on the updates for approximately one year. The mobile version of the website will be completed by the end of the calendar year, as the Registrar has decided on the appearance of the website and is waiting for developers to edit and test the site.</p>\n<p>Schmid said the changes will make G.O.L.D. “more manageable” for students to access the website on their phone. He said approximately 44 percent of the 4,864,849 times G.O.L.D. has been accessed in the past year has been through mobile phones.</p>\n<p>“Whenever I try to access G.O.L.D. on my phone to check things, it’s a bit of a pain to navigate and have to pinch and zoom to see anything,” Schmid said.</p>\n<p>The Registrar is also making adjustments to the “Graduation” page on G.O.L.D. to be more straightforward and is redesigning the “Advanced Course Search” function, Schmid said. There is not a set date for the completion of these projects.</p>\n<p>University Registrar Leesa Beck also said the Registrar is interested in making it easier to find and use degree audits to help more students understand their academic progress and graduate on time</p>\n<p>Schmid said, however, that the university is focused on updating the “look and feel” of the website before altering its functionality.</p>\n<p>Student Information Systems and Technology provides support for the Registrar’s websites and estimates the total project will cost between $15,000 and $20,000, depending on the amount of additional work needed based on the site testing.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, students have created their own extensions to the G.O.L.D. website unaffiliated with the university. An application called GauchoMap launched on Oct. 2016 on Google Chrome that allows students to locate their classes on G.O.L.D. in an interactive map.</p>\n<p>Students have shared information about the application on Facebook groups such as Free &amp; For Sale, a page on which students can buy and sell items like clothes and furniture. According to the Google Chrome web store, the application currently has 274 users.</p>\n<p>Schmid said students also added a Rate My Professor extension to the website, which lasted for approximately two years. He said the university is not concerned with the student-created extensions unless the extensions use the UCSB name and seal.</p>\n<p>Schmid said while the Registrar has not received any vocal complaints about the G.O.L.D. website, the Registrar wanted to upgrade the appearance of the site to keep it up-to-date with modern standards.</p>\n<p>“We figured it was time to move into the 20-teens [of technology],” Schmid said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 28, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-78887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Campbell Nolan / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Today, at 82 years old, Kirtman says he never guessed he would be the longest active teaching professor at UCSB.</p>\n<p>With vast knowledge of chemistry and university history as well as a witty sense of humor, Kirtman is the kind of professor who prompts the image of a long conversation over a cup of tea.</p>\n<p>He instantly make guests feel welcome in his paper-cluttered office on the fourth floor of the chemistry building.</p>\n<p>Kirtman is a professor in the chemistry department and specializes in the quantum theory of electronic structure, which requires predicting the properties of all chemical systems based on the electronic motions in their atomic systems.</p>\n<p>Born on March 30, 1935, and originally from New York, Kirtman went to Columbia University for undergraduate studies and received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Harvard University in 1961.</p>\n<p>The year 1965 was an exciting time for UCSB because the campus was expanding geographically and academically, Kirtman said.</p>\n<p>“The campus had decided to grow and I think that’s part of why I came here,” Kirtman said. “It was going to grow into a major research university.”</p>\n<p>“I get lost walking on the campus myself,” he joked, adding that the many construction projects over the years have transformed the university. The chemistry building where his office is located was not yet constructed when Kirtman began teaching in 1965.</p>\n<p>As Kirtman reflected on his most memorable moments at UCSB, he recalled the Vietnam War as a critical turning point in politics on campus and in the university’s academic curriculum.</p>\n<p>Kirtman said during the war he was responsible for managing a crisis courses program, in which professors could alter their class syllabi to include information about the operation in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>“Professors could either participate in that program and change the orientation of their course for a quarter to meet what was going on in Vietnam, or continue the way they were going,” Kirtman explained.</p>\n<p>While Kirtman did not reorganize his own classes on quantum theory to address the Vietnam War, he created a course for all students on the social responsibility of scientists in response to the war.</p>\n<p>“At the very beginning of the course, I had to reorient the class to develop the scientific way of thinking about things,” he said, noting that scientists and humanists differ in the way they reach conclusions and answers to problems.</p>\n<p>In bridging scientific thinking and social issues, Kirtman connected the way science was becoming increasingly political and addressed how scientists should be vocal in scientific political dialogue.</p>\n<p>Kirtman said his own son researches climate science at the University of Miami in Florida and said he hopes his son becomes involved in the political debate surrounding climate change.</p>\n<p>“I often say, ‘The lawyers think they can abolish the law of thermodynamics, which is a scientific law you can’t abolish,’ ” he said with a chuckle. “Science is made political by politicians and it is a very important issue right now.”</p>\n<p>Kirtman said he is most proud of his work with students who have gone on to careers in chemistry as well as his own research conducted in quantum theory.</p>\n<p>“There’s been a lot of individual research moments when the light bulb went on,” he said.</p>\n<p>He is especially proud of the “revolutionary” work he did with quantum theory as applied to electric fields interacting with crystalline materials. This work was featured in a symposium in Rhodes, Greece, in 2009.</p>\n<p>While Kirtman said he certainly has favorite students, he said he believes any student can be successful if they are willing to work diligently.</p>\n<p>He also served as the chair of the chemistry department from 1985 to 1994 and is the former chair of the Academic Senate. He was also one of the first professors to teach students in the College of Creative Studies when it formed in 1967.</p>\n<p>A love of UCSB runs in the family, as Kirtman’s wife also worked for the university as the director of publications for the <em>Nexus</em>. The couple will celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary in December.</p>\n<p>While his two children live on the East Coast, Kirtman said he loves the UC and California and does not have plans to leave anytime soon.</p>\n<p>“You don’t leave unless there’s good reason to leave,” he said. “Santa Barbara is a great place to live and work with very good faculty and students. So, why leave?”</p>\n<p>Kirtman dedicated his life to academics and said working and being a part of a university has been extremely rewarding. As the school year begins, Kirtman advises all students to take advantage of UCSB’s unique classes and academic opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Have fun. It’s a great time of life and you have no responsibilities,” Kirtman said enthusiastically, with perhaps a touch of nostalgia in his eyes. “Take everything that’s offered and pursue all your interests.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 28, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

August 2016 after the university opened a Title IX investigation against him. The university opened the investigation after it discovered a 19-second video in which Doe and his ex-girlfriend argued on camera before the screen went black.</p>\n<p>University officials said the video “amply justified” Doe’s suspension while the university conducted a Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>Doe filed a complaint against the university in December 2016 to remove the interim suspension and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">returned to school in April</a> 2017.</p>\n<p>Judge Thomas Anderle of the Santa Barbara Superior Court ruled against the imposed suspension in the March court order, citing the university’s concealment of evidence as a cause and calling the university “seriously prejudiced” in its actions.</p>\n<p>“This court disagrees with UCSB’s claim that the University’s use of the detective’s summaries in issuing the interim suspension does not violate his due process rights,” Anderle said in the court ruling. “John Doe is entitled to know all the information against him at the hearing, not via emailing his counsel allegedly critical and decisive information at a later time.”</p>\n<p>Bob Ottilie, Doe’s lawyer, submitted an amended complaint to Anderle in July alleging that the university concealed evidence from Doe and violated his right to due process.</p>\n<p>According to the court order and complaint, former director of judicial affairs Sandra Vasquez withheld two police emails from Doe during a hearing with him on Sept., 22, 2016 that the university used in the investigation. One email included statements by third parties attributed to Doe’s ex-girlfriend, Jane Doe.</p>\n<p>Anderle found that the university never contacted Jane Doe to corroborate the statements.</p>\n<p>After the hearing, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn made the decision to continue Doe’s suspension until the conclusion of the Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>The court received the evidence in March days before a court hearing on March 21. At the hearing, Klawunn said under oath she had considered the two pieces of concealed evidence in making her decision.</p>\n<p>The university declined to comment on the case.</p>\n<p>Vasquez has since left her position at UCSB and is now the dean of students at Pitzer College. Vasquez could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>In an email to the Pitzer student body in August in response to allegations of concealing evidence from Doe, however, Vasquez said she has “never concealed material evidence in any case.”</p>\n<p>Anderle also said in the court ruling that the university took too long to investigate, the<em> Nexus</em> reported in April, failing to conclude the Title IX investigation within the 60 calendar day deadline federally required for Title IX investigations and the 60 business day deadline required by the university.</p>\n<p>The Title IX investigation is still ongoing, and the university has not placed charges on the student or interviewed any key witnesses.<br>\nThe judge also ruled that the university caused Doe “irreparable harm” in barring him from the majority of his first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Ottilie said he is “confident” Doe’s record will ultimately be cleared due to the evidence in support of the student and Judge Anderle’s ruling in March.</p>\n<p>“If charged and convicted, we are just going to go back to court with the same record and the same judge and ask the judge to throw it out — which we’re confident he would,” Ottilie said.</p>\n<p>In a letter from Ottilie to the UC Regents and the Office of the Chancellor at UCSB, Ottilie expressed concern that the university mistreated Doe through the suspension because he is a minority student and unable to legally contest due to lack of financial resources.</p>\n<p>According to the March court ruling, Doe has incurred more than $100,000 in attorney’s fees since his filing in December. Ottilie said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> on Monday that Doe is currently unable to pay the expenses.</p>\n<p>The United States Department of Education accepted the case for further investigation of potential Title IX and VI policy violations.</p>\n<p>According to the Department of Education’s website, Title IX “prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex” and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 21, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78797\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/ex-judicial-affairs-director-for-ucsb-allegedly-hid-evidence-in-title-ix-case/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78797\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/ex-judicial-affairs-director-for-ucsb-allegedly-hid-evidence-in-title-ix-case/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/ex-judicial-affairs-director-for-ucsb-allegedly-hid-evidence-in-title-ix-case/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/ex-judicial-affairs-director-for-ucsb-allegedly-hid-evidence-in-title-ix-case/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/ex-judicial-affairs-director-for-ucsb-allegedly-hid-evidence-in-title-ix-case/","id":2362,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2361,2360,2359],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":72,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
