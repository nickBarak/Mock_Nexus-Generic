The center would provide legal assistance for survivors of sexual assault and would recieve support from A.S. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The demand calls for a survivor resource center that will “lead programming efforts to spread awareness among the student body and throughout the off campus Isla Vista community.”</p>\n<p>The center will also require a full-time director and staff, as well as legal service for sexual assault survivors.</p>\n<p>Students at the Tuesday’s meeting asked that the center be effective for underrepresented communities, which they said should help in creating and managing the center.</p>\n<p>The university requested $56,000 to secure the help of the Alliance for HOPE, a nonprofit agency that develops family justice centers to protect and heal sexual assault survivors and their families.</p>\n<p>The university submitted the funding request in December, but the status will not be known until “spring time” of this year, said C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway during the meeting.</p>\n<p>An additional assessment proposal provides a “blueprint” for all constituents involved in planning the creation of a survivor resource center, Conway added.</p>\n<p>Students expressed concern that collaborating with outside entities might not be effective in authentically representing the marginalized communities that the center aims to support.</p>\n<p>Third-year communications major Jasmine Lee said a more concrete timeline of the two-year assessment proposal and the university funding request status would help student organizers search for alternate sources of funding.</p>\n<p>She said the university needs to communicate with students about the financing process so they can take action as the funding comes through.</p>\n<p>Katya Armistead, Dean of Student Life, said during the meeting that it can be “helpful to bring in an outsider to facilitate” the creation of the center.</p>\n<p>Armistead also said the university must apply for grants in order to build the center. But the university already has other grants lined up, which might delay the approval of a grant for the center, she said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Justice Dumlao requested that the center be part of the Associated Students Boards, Commissions and Units so the center can work closely and partner with student organizations and campus departments.</p>\n<p>“This is not going to be C.A.R.E. out in I.V.,” Conway said, referring to the Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education program. “This is a separate, distinct resource.” Conway also explained that the center will be its own entity, independent from existing UCSB sexual assault survivor resources.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. will still be a “strong partner” moving forward with the center, Conway added.</p>\n<p>“This needs to be bigger than just C.A.R.E.,” she said.</p>\n<p>There will be a follow-up meeting to further discuss the demand on March 6 at the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared

a local government official questioned if the project is feasible. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The sexual assault “report card” is one of 12 demands that UC Santa Barbara administrators agreed to address in May 2017 after a student sit-in. But so far, neither the university nor the local government has started to work on it.</p>\n<p>The demand calls for the university to “work with the Isla Vista Community Services District to develop a report card… for behaviors and education surrounding rape and sexual assault in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>At a Feb. 8 town hall, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn featured the report card in a slideshow documenting the progress made on the demands. In the slideshow, the report card was listed as “in progress.”</p>\n<p>But the university did not contact I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand about the report card until Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“The CSD looks forward to working with the university on these continued efforts, but at this point there has not been a partnership on that front,” Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> after a Feb. 12 CSD meeting.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said she was under the impression that the CSD was working directly with students on the report card.</p>\n<p>“It had come up at one of the meetings that we had, where I was told that students were working directly with the CSD on that item,” Klawunn said. “I thought I was only reporting progress that was being made.” She said she did not remember who had told her or at which meeting.</p>\n<p>Klawunn spoke to Bertrand about the report card on Tuesday night, after the <em>Nexus </em>had inquired about the university’s progress. She said Bertrand told her that the report card is not actually feasible.</p>\n<p>“I sought Ethan out yesterday and asked him,” she said. “He said, ‘No, we can’t do it the way [Ro’Shawndra Earvin] had hoped it’d be carried out.’” Earvin led the 2017 sit-in.</p>\n<p>The demand calls for documenting crime in I.V. and counting the number of meetings that have educated the community about sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Local officials will need to find a different way to create a report card, Klawunn said. She suggested creating local crime reports as an alternative. Bertrand could not be reached to elaborate on how an alternate report card would look.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 22 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-81450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In light of the recent mass shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, Santa Barbara students and lawmakers are calling for a significant change in gun policies to prevent more senseless deaths. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“People are tired of thoughts and prayers, and people want to see action. It may not be typical for a vigil to so quickly become political action, but it’s necessary right now,” Spencer Brandt, Community Services District board secretary, said.</p>\n<p>After a former student entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and killed 17 people with an AR-15, individuals across the country have renewed efforts for “common-sense” gun laws, including Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>“We owe these families more than just our thoughts and prayers,” he said in a statement released the day after the shooting.</p>\n<p>Brandt, with CSD President Ethan Bertrand and Associated Students (A.S.) External Vice President Batsheva Labowe-Stoll, organized a vigil for the Parkland shooting on Feb. 21.</p>\n<p>“[We] organized the vigil for Parkland, standing in solidarity with them because gun violence is absolutely a scourge on our country,” Brandt said. “In Isla Vista, we are inextricably linked to gun violence because of the tragedy in 2014.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand, Brandt, Labowe-Stoll, A.S. President Hieu Le and several other UC Santa Barbara students signed letters to President Trump during the vigil, urging him to pass “common-sense” gun control measures.</p>\n<p>Brandt said proposed laws, such as the one that would allow firearms to be removed from individuals in a state of crisis, is a “common-sense fix that will save lives.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after the Florida shooting, Carbajal, with Representatives Elizabeth Esty and Don Beyer, released a statement urging the passing of H.R. 2598, which would allow family members or law enforcement officials to petition a judge to remove firearms from an individual in crisis.</p>\n<p>“No parent should send their children to school each day wondering if they will return home. We are once again reminded that we have a responsibility to act in Congress to change things,” Carbajal said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Carbajal spoke at a UCSB Campus Democrats meeting on Feb. 20, explaining that he had first introduced H.R. 2598 in May 2017.</p>\n<p>“We have a majority Republican leadership right now … There’s very little chance for common sense gun safety laws to move forward,” he said during the meeting. “Anything that helps us create a safer country and safer communities might be a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Restrictions on purchasing a gun vary from state to state.</p>\n<p>In California, a person must be 18 years old to purchase a rifle or a shotgun and 21 to purchase a handgun, according to the California attorney general’s website. California law states that there must be a 10-day waiting period before the firearm can be “released” to the purchaser.</p>\n<p>The purchaser must also provide evidence of identity and age, and handgun purchasers must provide proof of California residency. “Large-capacity magazines,” or guns that accept more than 10 rounds, are illegal in California as of Jan. 1, 2000.</p>\n<p>Any person who has been convicted for a felony or has been “held involuntarily as a danger to self or others” is prohibited from buying, possessing or owning firearms or ammunition.</p>\n<p>As of Jan. 1, 2018, the kind of weapon used in the Florida shooting cannot be bought in California.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important to remember that the people leading this right now aren’t gun [control] advocacy groups … it’s the students. It’s the students in Parkland who were in the building when one of their former classmates came in with an AR-15 and starting shooting,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He said the students’ response to the shooting is a “cry for help.”</p>\n<p>“They should be the ones who should be remembered as getting the momentum going if we actually get something to happen this time around,” he said.</p>\n<p>Several vigils for victims of mass shootings have been held at UCSB. The most recent one was a Nov. 7 vigil for the victims of the Sutherland, Texas shooting.</p>\n<p>“This is about gun violence in the community and seeing the leaders that in higher officials than us act responsibly. As an elected official, I’m ashamed that there are others who are acting in such a way to undermine just the basic safety of people in our country,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

About $2.429 billion would come from changing the income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, $1.72 billion from eliminating Public Service Loan Forgiveness and $1.5 billion from eliminating subsidized loans, according to data from the Trump Administration.</p>\n<p>Currently, the government pays interest on subsidized student loans while students are in school or the loans are in deferment. If the changes in the new budget are enacted, the federal government would only offer unsubsidized loans.</p>\n<p>The budget suggests “streamlining”  IDR plans for student loans and altering the cap on the percentage of income for these plans and the length of payment.</p>\n<p>Currently there are several IDR plans dependant on income.</p>\n<p>Under the suggestions laid out in the budget, repayment would be capped at 12.5 percent of discretionary income, and balances would be forgiven after 15 years of repayment for undergraduates and after 30 years for graduate students.</p>\n<p>The proposed changes would “focus assistance on needy undergraduate student borrowers instead of high-income, high-balance graduate borrowers.”</p>\n<p>These new conditions would apply only to students borrowing loans beginning July 1, 2019, and would not apply to students who are already using student loans from the federal government.</p>\n<p>The budget also encourages Congress to pass a law that would make colleges and universities assume some of the financial risk associated with student loans.</p>\n<p>The budget also suggests changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.) and CalFresh, which is California’s version of the program. A portion of the monetary benefits that program recipients currently receive would be replaced with a box of food.</p>\n<p>Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), compared the proposed program to Blue Apron, the meal delivery service, at a press briefing.</p>\n<p>Mulvaney said it would cause “tremendous” cost savings.</p>\n<p>“It lowers the cost to us because we can buy prices at wholesale, whereas they have to buy it at retail. It also makes sure that they’re getting nutritious food,” he said.</p>\n<p>The reforms to S.N.A.P. would save about $17 billion, according to numbers the OMB produced.</p>\n<p>UCSB students who receive benefits from CalFresh would be impacted by the proposed changes.</p>\n<p>Rodolfo Herrera, the coordinator of the A.S. Food Bank, said the average student at UCSB receiving CalFresh benefits received about $150 per month.  He noted, however, that the amount students receive varies significantly.</p>\n<p>He added that international and undocumented students are not able to receive these benefits.</p>\n<p>He said the freedom of students to purchase foods from CalFresh is “really important” because recipients can use it to buy foods that don’t require a lot of cooking or processing, which he noted would matter especially to students preparing for finals or midterms.</p>\n<p>According to data provided by Herrera, CalFresh sales at the Isla Vista Food Co-op totalled $52,930 in 2015 and $68,000 in 2016.</p>\n<p>Herrera said the logistics of implementing Trump’s proposed program would be difficult, including storing large quantities of food and even keeping up with people’s addresses.</p>\n<p>“The big system programs that we have for supplemental nutrition for low-income families have been established for a few decades already. The logistical aspects of it are already in place,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 4 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hayley Tice</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hayley Tice serves as data editor for the 2020-21 school year.

They will also receive an advisor and a significant increase in funding.</p>\n<p>The resolution was authored by Matt Nielson, vice chair of the TSA, Julian Armada, chair of the TSA and Kian Maalizadeh and Ilene Ochoa, who are both A.S. Senate liaisons to the organization.</p>\n<p>The four worked on the resolution during Fall Quarter and filed a motion to get the TSA certified as a BCU.</p>\n<p>The amount of funding the TSA will receive is still being discussed. According to Armada, Maalizadeh first suggested that the budget should be around $20,000, but then expectations were lowered to $10,000.</p>\n<p>When the TSA was an entity of the Office of Student Life (OSL), their budget was no larger than $500, Armada explained.</p>\n<p>Prior to the TSA becoming an A.S. entity, they received their funding solely from fundraisers and donations.</p>\n<p>“We had to spend a lot of time raising money before we even put on events,” Nielson said.</p>\n<p>The TSA had their first meeting as a BCU on Monday, Feb. 12. Armada said he had seen an increase in membership since the TSA officially became a BCU.</p>\n<p>“It’s small now, but I’m hoping that their interest will keep growing,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re one of the only UCs who didn’t have a transfer organization as a part of the Associated Students… That was shocking to me considering how many transfer students are being accepted, and it’s only increasing each year,” he added.</p>\n<p>The previous board of the TSA had intended to make their organization an entity of A.S., but failed to do so due to a lack of guidance from Senate, according to Nielson.</p>\n<p>With the help of Maalizadeh and Ochoa, the TSA was able to draft the proposal and complete the internal paperwork needed.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the things we want to do is just advocate for resources. With transfers, there’s no centralized voice,” Maalizadeh said. “There’s only so much a single person can do, but there’s so much that an organized group can do.”</p>\n<p>Maalizadeh envisions the TSA using its position in A.S. not just to hold community events, but also to advocate for resources such as more tutoring services and a better transfer student orientation.</p>\n<p>The TSA plans to work with the Transfer Student Center (TSC) by collaborating on events and utilizing the resources provided by the center.</p>\n<p>“Right now, I am a Transfer Peer Educator at the TSC, and I felt a division with the two even though we are serving the same constituents,” Ochoa said. “Now, I hope having a TSC liaison with the TSA will create more of a bond and collaborative efforts.”</p>\n<p>All four authors of the resolution emphasized that they hope to see transfer students having a larger presence on campus now that they have adequate representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“Transfers come from everywhere, but we all have the same common identity of being a transfer,” Maalizadeh said. “I want to make sure that when people go to UCSB as a transfer, they aren’t an afterthought.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg.4 of the Feb. 15 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

there was a 50 percent increase in attendance for weekly Students for Recovery 12-step open meetings, according to Angie Bryan, the GFR Recovery Program Manager.</p>\n<p>In response, GFR ​announced three new support groups for students and community members recovering from addiction. The new S.M.A.R.T. Recovery meeting and Graduate/Non-Traditional Student 12-step meeting diversify the organization’s approach, allowing for students with different paths and a more cognitive method of addressing addiction.</p>\n<p>GFR also began hosting an Alanon meeting for family members and loved ones affected by people with substance use disorders, who are either working or not working toward recovery.</p>\n<p>Bryan founded GFR in the fall of 2012 after working in the UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program as a marriage and family therapist.</p>\n<p>After researching other campus-based collegiate recovery programs, Bryan found a similar program at Texas Tech University, which provided grants through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for replication programs on other campuses.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been in long-term recovery for 13 years so this is something that I was really interested in,” Bryan said. “So [SAMHSA] paid for me to go out there and see their program and see how we might start it here.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Behavioral Wellness Department agreed to contribute start-up funding for GFR after Bryan met someone within the department who “happened to be in long-term recovery also.”</p>\n<p>According to Bryan, UCSB is the only UC that has an Alcohol and Drug Program. The program has been around for nearly 10 years, which Bryan said shows that the university already recognizes that support is needed. She believes recovery fit naturally into the campus services.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been very lucky here because UCSB administration has always been really supportive of this program,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>“The 18-25 age group is the fastest growing number of people going for treatment for alcohol and drug abuse. So we’re seeing a lot more students coming to college already in recovery or students getting into recovery while in college,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>At the start of the program, there were less than 10 people in attendance, and now at least a few dozen show up for meetings, according to fourth-year physics major and peer-intern Noah Shachar.</p>\n<p>“So nationally it’s a huge trend that we’re seeing, which is why there’s over 100 schools across the country that have some form of collegiate recovery support,” Bryan said. “We’re definitely one of the leaders in the country in development and what we have to offer here in our program.”</p>\n<p>GFR also hosts “sober events” for students to get out of I.V., including two camping trips a year, as well as “unity events,” Shachar said.<br>\nThe camping trips are organized in Spring Quarter around Deltopia and in Fall Quarter around Halloween. Bryan said these trips provide students alternative spaces when Isla Vista “isn’t a recovery-friendly environment.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody is mandated to come to our program; it’s all people that want our support on a voluntary basis,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>Advocacy work helps change campus culture and reduce the stigma that a person in recovery is a “stereotypical addict,” Shachar and Bryan agreed.</p>\n<p>“When we use the term ‘person in recovery’ it sounds like someone that is trying to make some changes and are goal-oriented toward recovery… Someone in recovery is constantly in recovery and constantly improving upon themselves,” Shachar said. “We’re here to show people that you can start doing that at any time, at any age, in any situation — if that’s what you want.”</p>\n<p>GFR just ended its last year in contract with the county Behavioral and Wellness department because of policy changes. It is uncertain where funding will come from next year. However, Bryan said she is not worried because of support from the university and acquired grants.</p>\n<p>“I’m trying to trust that things will happen because so far in developmental programs that’s just how things work,” Bryan said. “Right when we think something isn’t going to work, something always comes out of the work, and we go from there.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

night of sleep at a fire station in Managua, Nicaragua, after an eight-hour bicycle ride through the Latin country.</p>\n<p>“We had a pretty crazy day,” Connell recounted with a laugh heard through the phone. “It was just hectic with a lot of wind and a lot of sun. We had to ride almost 100 miles, and I ended up getting a flat tire, but we made it to the fire station, which was our goal.”</p>\n<p>Connell and Lee have been on the road biking since Oct. 20, 2017. After graduating from UCSB in the spring of 2017, the two saved up money from summer jobs and decided to embark on a trip from Isla Vista to Colombia, opting for a different mode of transportation than the average traveler.</p>\n<p>“I thought, ‘What better way than to bike there?’” Connell said. “And then I thought, ‘What friend do I have that’s crazy enough to take on an adventure like that as well?’ So I gave Quincy a call.”</p>\n<p>Lee considered the offer for about 10 seconds before saying, “Yup, I’m down.”</p>\n<p>They started biking from the 6800 block of Del Playa Drive, where Connell and Lee were met by friends who biked with them until they reached the edge of campus. They then rode through I.V. and onto campus, past the library and under Henley Gate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81116\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"636970733\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81085\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81116\" data-attachment-id=\"81116\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/img_7054-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_7054\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81116\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Connell and Lee began their journey in Isla Vista, biking through town and campus before riding under Henley Gate. They made it to Malibu on their first day of biking. <em>Courtesy of Daniel Connell</em></p></div>\n<p>“Our first day, we rode out of I.V. through Santa Barbara. We ended up in Malibu that day, and up until that point, that was the longest bike ride of my life,” Lee said, adding that since then, he’s easily doubled the time he spends on his bike.</p>\n<p>“It was pretty significant because the last four years of our life were at UCSB,” Connell reflected. “That was our home, and it was a significant change to actually leave from that home to start this new segment of our lives.”</p>\n<p>After reaching the U.S. border, they spent 80 days exploring Mexico until they reached Belize. From there, they traveled through Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Monday night’s rest in Nicaragua was another stop on their journey as they prepare to bike through Costa Rica and Panama until reaching Colombia.</p>\n<p>But the two will remind you that it’s not really about the destination anymore, after having interacted with folks in numerous cities on their journey. They say they have experienced generosity, hospitality and love as they have been welcomed into the homes of strangers.</p>\n<p>“I think when we arrive in Colombia, we’re going to have a list of about 250 people we’ll need to call, like ‘We made it!’” Lee laughed. “Not even people from back home, but people we met along the way.”</p>\n<p>Connell says after 100 days on the road, they have not yet paid for a place to sleep, instead relying on the kindness of locals ― including families, firemen and policemen ― who welcome them into their homes and workspaces. Other nights, they have camped in parks, basketball courts, at bus stops or on the side of the road.</p>\n<p>They even strung a hammock between two broken semi-trucks one night.</p>\n<p>“And if it wasn’t the best rest I ever had,” Lee recalled.</p>\n<p>The bikers will admit that the most challenging part of the journey has been the biking itself; pedaling up rocky mountains for hours on end in extreme heat with bicycles that weigh about 140 pounds can take a toll.</p>\n<p>Both agreed the exercise has been as much a mental exertion as a physical one. Often, they ride on freeways with trucks whizzing past them, with a clamor of honking horns in the background.</p>\n<p>Lee once faced off with a bull in the middle of the road, remembering that its horn came within inches of his handlebars.</p>\n<p>He describes biking in these situations as a “mental game” that’s better than “any meditation [he’s] experienced ever before.”</p>\n<p>Connell said one of the best parts of the trip has been “breaking that social stigma” that people have about countries that are often portrayed in the media as dangerous.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81110\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1796918267\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81085\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81110\" data-attachment-id=\"81110\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/img_2784/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_2784\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81110\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The bikers stayed in Belize for two weeks after a local man invited them to stay with him and his family in their home. <em>Courtesy of Daniel Connell</em></p></div>\n<p>Connell and Lee said they planned to go to an island in Belize for one day and ended up staying for two weeks after a man invited them to stay with him and his family.</p>\n<p>“It was something special because he lived on a separate island, and his daily commute from one island to the next was via his homemade sailboat that he made purely out of materials that he found on the beach where he lives,” Connell said.</p>\n<p>They both agreed that Honduras has been their favorite country to visit so far, but only after some hesitation.</p>\n<p>“That’s a hard question!” they exclaimed in unison.

Connell and Lee’s goal of $5,000 would be enough money to donate 30 bikes to people around the world. They have currently raised $3,000.</p>\n<p>“We’re using this tool [bicycle] to change our lives… and to be able to help people use the same tool to change their lives and their community is really special,” Connell said.</p>\n<p>They are raising money through the organization’s website and their <a href=\"https://locosciclos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personal blog</a>, where they keep friends and family updated on their whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Connell and Lee have two more months of biking ahead of them until they reach Colombia. Despite the long journey they’ve already had, they aren’t tired — anyone could hear it through the excitement in their voices.</p>\n<p>In fact, the travel mementos they have packed keeps growing, adding more weight to their bags, although they would say it’s worth it.</p>\n<p>They currently are carrying a guitar, ukulele, multiple books, fins to help them swim, cooking supplies and even a backgammon set, Connell said.</p>\n<p>“We <em>had</em> a backgammon set,” Lee reminded his friend.</p>\n<p>“Okay, we <em>had</em> a backgammon set,” Connell conceded. “We recently lost that and it’s quite heartbreaking.”</p>\n<p>Yet it doesn’t seem to be the objects that have made this trip so worthwhile for Connell and Lee. Instead, it’s been the knowledge gained along the way, the change in their worldview and the strengthening of their own friendship.</p>\n<p>“After four years at UCSB, me and Quince, to put it in funny terms, were homies,” Connell chuckled. “We would hang out, but we never actually traveled together, and to go from that to sleeping within a foot of each other ― we’re like a married couple.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps at the end of the day, it comes down to a love of biking and a friendship that started at UCSB. One thing is for sure: Connell and Lee don’t seem to be braking anytime soon ― they are already planning their next trip, maybe biking through the Middle East, including Iraq and Iran, or from Colombia to Patagonia at “the end of the world.”</p>\n<p>They have a few rides ahead of them to figure it out.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 15, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/","id":2323,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2322,2321,2320],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Search for Attempted Burglary Suspects in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Three male suspects attempted to burglarize an Isla Vista residence on Sunday morning, breaking into the home and later fleeing the scene, the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office reported Wednesday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Three male suspects attempted to burglarize an Isla Vista residence on Sunday morning, breaking into the home and later fleeing the scene, the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office reported Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The suspects entered a second-story apartment on the 800 block of Camino Del Sur after climbing a flight of stairs while residents were asleep, according to a Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) press release.

He later only found out the union was involved when money for the union was taken out of his paycheck.</p>\n<p>“The union voice is not my voice. The union’s fight is not my fight. But a piece of my paycheck every week still goes to the union,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>He wrote that he took his job because he cares about kids, but said he no longer wants to pay union dues.</p>\n<p>He added that he is not anti-union, but that “unions aren’t a fit for everyone. And I shouldn’t be forced to pay money to a union if I don’t think it does a good job representing my interests.”</p>\n<p>Tom Steel, a third-year philosophy, ethics and public policy major and Teamster 2010 Student Organizer, said <em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME </em>would allow non-union members to “free-ride off the negotiating efforts of the union that everybody else pays into,” because labor unions are legally bound to represent them.</p>\n<p>Steel explained that non-unionized workers currently pay fair share fees that cover the cost of the bargaining contract that the workers benefit from, and that the case would make it so that individuals not represented by a union would no longer have to pay fees.</p>\n<p>“Free riders still have to be represented by the union. So if the free-riders have any grievances or any other issues like that, the union still has to expand resources to cover those members, even though those free-riders do not pay anything into the union whatsoever,” he added.</p>\n<p>Public sector union laws differ slightly from private sector unions, Young said. Public sector unions are funded by taxpayers, while private sector unions are funded by business entities.</p>\n<p><em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em> would affect public sectors unions. Private sector unions would not be similarly affected.</p>\n<p>“There’s two sets of labor laws. One way to think of it is the private sector is governed by a national labor law, whereas the public section is done state by state. We fall under the California State Labor Law Code, the teamsters who work at UCSB and other unions too,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Teamsters 2010 is statewide and covers all 10 UC campuses as well as the CSU campuses, according to Young.</p>\n<p>Young explained that when a similar law was passed in Wisconsin recently, public sector workers’ wages immediately decreased, and even the non-unionized workers saw their wages go down.</p>\n<p>“This just really hurts the whole economy because here at UCSB we’re the largest employer in Santa Barbara. Undercut my wages, then I’m not going to be able to shop locally, right, I’m just going to have to subsist on the bare minimum,” he said.</p>\n<p>Right now, unions act as a check on workplace safety issues and workplace discrimination, Steel said.</p>\n<p>“[Unions are] able to do that because they have the financial resources to provide resources for their members, to provide legal guidance to establish a fair and equitable workplace,” he said. “If the unions lose this financial backing, because free-riders won’t pay into the union, not only will they lose their strength, but this check on the employer is going to be diminished.”</p>\n<p>He explained that if <em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em> is passed, employees could face challenges similar to those from the late 1800s and early 1900s, where “employees did not have a voice that was able to combat the whims of the employer.”</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that this would weaken unions, and it would diminish the roles that unions have in their ability to protect their workers,” Steel said.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court will hear opening arguments for the case on Feb. 26.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 15 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The more it makes us money, the less we rely on foreign oil,” she said.</p>\n<p>Fergus explained that allowing offshore drilling would be an enormous step backward in efforts to convert UCSB into an environmentally friendly campus.</p>\n<p>California’s exemption from the DPP would have positive political implications by forcing transportation and energy industries to turn to alternative, more sustainable resources such as wind and solar energy, Fergus said.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, a fourth-year sociology and economics double major and vice chair of UCSB’s Coastal Fund, said that increased oil development makes clean energy seem like a better alternative.</p>\n<p>“I think that by not relying on such harmful forms of energy both in extraction and use, we incentivize the innovation that we need,” Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>CALPIRG recently released an email petition for campus community members to sign in opposition of offshore oil drilling. The group’s goal is to make the UCSB campus run on 100 percent renewable energy, according to Fergus.</p>\n<p>“There’s no safe way to drill for oil and transport oil,” said Liam Horstick, campus organizer of UCSB CALPIRG. “We shouldn’t be drilling for more fossil fuels, anyway, because of the impact to climate change and 100 percent renewable energy.”</p>\n<p>Joan Hartmann, third district supervisor and Santa Barbara County representative, is currently working on several projects to push the county toward more sustainable sources of energy.</p>\n<p>According to an email statement from Hartmann, such projects include “evaluating Community Choice Energy, increasing buildout local distributed energy resources such as solar, demanding response and energy storage to create a more resilient energy system and promoting zero emission vehicles and infrastructure for these vehicles that don’t have internal combustion engines.”</p>\n<p>The Dos Cuadros oil field holds about 11.4 million accessible barrels of crude oil under the Santa Barbara Channel and is part of what attracts oil companies to California’s Central Coast. The federally leased field is regulated by the DOI, not the state of California.</p>\n<p>In early 1969, a well blowout about 10 miles from Santa Barbara’s coast in the Dos Cuadras field caused the spill of roughly 100,000 barrels of crude oil into the Santa Barbara Channel, polluting beaches from Goleta to Ventura and on four of the Channel Islands.</p>\n<p>Over 3,600 sea birds died, along with fish, barnacles and some marine mammals. The spill resulted in $9.5 million of commercial and private property damage.</p>\n<p>The platform that caused the spill is currently still in operation today, along with its three sibling platforms.</p>\n<p>The effects of the spill contributed to the passage of several environmental protection acts as well as the establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the California Coastal Commission.</p>\n<p>A major spill occurred again in 2015, when a Plains All American pipeline burst, sending 3,400 barrels of crude oil into the waters of Refugio State Beach. The pipeline has now been closed.</p>\n<p>The 1969 and 2015 oil spills have served as points of reference for many opponents of the DOI’s movement to open coastal waters to drilling.</p>\n<p>“The Central Coast knows all too well the risks that oil drilling poses to our communities, and I will continue to urge this Administration to take our coastline off the negotiating table,” Carbajal said in his statement.</p>\n<p>Since 1969, the California States Lands Commission has not granted any new offshore drilling leases within its jurisdiction limit of three miles off the coast, though existing operations were allowed to continue.</p>\n<p>The DOI temporarily paused operations on California’s Outer Continental Shelf following the 1969 spill until the passages of the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act in 1970.</p>\n<p>Another major component of the opposition to the proposal is California’s economy. According to Hartmann, coastal recreational, fishing and tourism are essential to the state’s thriving economy and the proposed program could be extremely detrimental to such industries.</p>\n<p>Like California, coastal states across the country rose in opposition against the BOEM’s proposed plan. Governors in Washington and Oregon joined Brown to sign a joint statement in early January saying that the states would take any measure to prevent oil drilling.</p>\n<p>“They’ve chosen to forget the utter devastation of past offshore oil spills … They’ve chosen to ignore the science that tells us our climate is changing and we must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. But we won’t forget history or ignore science,” the statement read.</p>\n<p>The BOEM is currently holding public meetings across the country regarding each coastal state’s stance on drilling.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 15, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

policies include a 72-hour evacuation timeline, an interactive county map and new storm evacuation definitions. Residents can type their address into the map to determine whether they are in a high-risk area.</p>\n<p>At the time of the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides, the UC Santa Barbara Emergency Flip Chart did not outline specific procedures.

There will first be a pre-evacuation advisory, then a recommended evacuation warning and then a mandatory evacuation order.</p>\n<p>The Storm Evacuation Definitions says that with a mandatory evacuation order, “extreme risk for loss of property and life exists,” and that “personal discretion is not an option.”</p>\n<p>In a press conference last week, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown spoke about the possibility of future strong weather.</p>\n<p>“A strong possibility exists that we will need to call for future evacuations,” he said. “While evacuations are inconvenient and troublesome, they are also temporary and incredibly important. Most importantly, they can be life-saving.”</p>\n<p>In the case of an evacuation, university policies are also vague. According to the Flip Chart, the UCSB Emergency Operation Center Executive Policy Group has the power to implement an evacuation in the case of a “major emergency.”</p>\n<p>During the Thomas Fire, many students were frustrated about the poor air quality and the quality of the masks given out by the university.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Student Health Services (SHS) typically keeps about 5,000 N95 masks on hand and ordered an additional 18,000 during the fire, according to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>Estrada said that surgical masks were distributed as a temporary measure.</p>\n<p>After the initial supply of 5,000 masks was distributed and SHS was waiting for delivery of additional N95 masks, surgical masks were distributed as a temporary measure.</p>\n<p>“But students were advised to return to Student Health to pick up the recommended N95 masks,” she said in email.</p>\n<p>The fire impacted patient care at SHS as well.</p>\n<p>Estrada said that while SHS stayed open, its employees were unable to access electronic medical records during the blackouts and used “emergency procedures” for paper communication.</p>\n<p>SHS has a backup generator that it used during these periods for essential services, such as keeping vaccines at proper temperatures and lighting.</p>\n<p>According to Estrada, generators on campus are tested on a monthly basis, with an annual test where building emergency systems are transferred to the generator to simulate an actual event.</p>\n<p>Estrada also said that the campus implemented several policies to respond to the fire, including a mutual aid provision among UC campuses, an Emergency Leave from Work provision and a memorandum of understanding between UCSB and the Red Cross that enabled the Red Cross to host a shelter on UCSB property.</p>\n<p>The campus communicated to students through email, a page on the UCSB Current, social media channels, a special Call Center that was created to field calls related to the fire and a banner on the website.</p>\n<p>Longbrake also recommended that students and other community members sign up for alerts from the county’s emergency alert system, Aware &amp; Prepare at <em>awareandprepare.org.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the Feb. 15 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Senate meeting. It states that UCSB should partner with Sprigeo, a third-party vendor, to offer students a 24/7 mobile application, webform, text hotline, phone hotline and email hotline to report a crime.</p>\n<p>If the Senate passes the resolution, A.S. would establish a contract with Sprigeo for the service and “widely publicize” the app to incoming students as a way to report sexual assault on campus and in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of partnering with this company is that so many resources in Associated Students are available and we pay for them, but no students know they exist or they don’t know how to access them, and that’s a huge issue,” said Senator Kristen Armellini, who co-authored the resolution with Senator Grecia Martinez.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Matan Bostick sponsored the resolution.</p>\n<p>The Sprigeo app would allow students to anonymously report offenses that would then be processed by “designated university officials and [be] appropriately and confidentially responded to in prompt fashion,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Following a lengthy debate, the Senate sent the resolution to External Affairs to be discussed further.</p>\n<p>Before voting, some senators expressed disappointment with how the subject was approached.</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse said that the Senate had last spoken to Bostick two weeks before, but that the updated resolution was “slapped on” the night before the meeting.</p>\n<p>She added that the resolution should have been created in conjunction with current student efforts to combat sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I have a problem with [the resolution] is that no one is doing anything unless it makes them look real good, or they care about it and they’re caring about it when they’re not prioritizing other issues,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The amount of time allotted to work on the resolution was also a point of concern for some senators because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p>\n<p>“This resolution shouldn’t be worked in a week. It should be worked in one month, two months, three months,” Senator Andrea Reyes said.</p>\n<p>Another issue addressed was the use of the names of two UCSB alumni in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The alumni mentioned have previously hosted sit-ins regarding sexual assault. The first was held by Alejandra Melgoza in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 2015</a> and lasted for 13 hours; the second was led by Ro’Shawndra Earvin in May 2017 and lasted for nine hours.</p>\n<p>In both instances, Chancellor Henry T. Yang agreed to the students’ <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nowUCsb13InitialDemandsforChancellorYang.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">respective demands</a>, although Earvin has continued fighting for the completion of the demands, most recently at a Feb. 8 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-09/sexual-assault-survivors-raise-frustrations-over-unresolved-demands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Town Hall meeting</a>.</p>\n<p>Both Melgoza and Earvin said they were not contacted by the authors of the resolution or asked to have their names included.</p>\n<p>“Using my name without consent is perpetuating the same acts of violence,” Melgoza said during public forum.</p>\n<p>Armellini spoke about the intentions of the resolution, saying it came “prematurely” to the senate and that it “needs work”.</p>\n<p>“In no way was this resolution supposed to produce this anxiety and uproar,” she said.</p>\n<p>Currently, students can report incidents of sexual assault through the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) if the incident occurs on campus or through the Title IX &amp; Sexual Harassment Policy Compliance Office. Local law enforcement like the Isla Vista Foot Patrol can address an incident if it occurred off campus.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) is another campus resource students can use to anonymously report sexual assault. Students can go online to file a report, which will then be forwarded to UCPD and other campus offices.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/","id":2326,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2325,2324,2323],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Graduate Student Dies in Crash After Driving Wrong Way on Highway 101","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2018-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/JKopecky_5.25.10_Freeway-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/JKopecky_5.25.10_Freeway-1.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"While traveling at normal freeway speed, the victim’s 2012 Nissan Sentra collided with a concrete rail on the freeway median.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A UC Santa Barbara graduate student and Isla Vista resident died early Saturday morning after driving the wrong way on Highway 101, California Highway Patrol (CHP) reported.</p>\n<p>Alan Anhphi Vu, 28, was reportedly driving north on a 101 southbound lane in Santa Barbara at 1:58 a.m. While traveling at normal freeway speed, Vu’s 2012 Nissan Sentra collided with a concrete rail on the freeway median.
