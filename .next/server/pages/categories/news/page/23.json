Levine, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-23/galoustian-files-motion-in-court-requesting-ucpd-internal-documents-alleging-violation-of-due-process-in-his-arrest-and-investigation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented a Pitchess motion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is used in instances when a defendant wants to request information from a police officer’s personnel file. The motion was originally filed with the court on Oct. 3, 2019. Levine’s motion resulted in the trial being pushed back to January 2020; it was initially scheduled to begin on Dec. 4, 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine was particularly interested in investigating Officer Ryan Hashimoto, who allegedly circulated a video “of an alleged sexual assault that was evidence in [Galoustian’s] case” and was an initial investigator in Galoustian’s case, which began in December 2017, when he was first arrested. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This incident was detailed in a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed against the UC Santa Barbara Police Department in March, in which Officer Ryan Smith, who is referred to as John Doe in court documents, alleged widespread racism, misconduct and conspiracy within the department.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alison Bernal, an attorney for the Regents of the University of California, and Lieutenant Robert Romero of UCPD, appeared as representatives of the department at the Wednesday afternoon court appearance. The two confirmed to Judge James Herman that an internal affairs investigation had just been opened against Hashimoto and that it would take approximately six months for it to conclude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herman ruled against Levine’s motion, which named multiple officers — Hashimoto, Officers Michael Little and Tiffany Little and Lieutenant Mark Signa — who Bernal, Romero and Karapetian confirmed were not involved in the case, but still granted Levine the additional time to investigate Hashimoto independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herman initially considered pushing the trial back a full six months to allow Levine access to the internal affairs findings, but Karapetian, who is also a senior deputy district attorney for Santa Barbara County, pressed the judge to consider the victims, who she said were “eager” and “anxious” to get the trial over with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would be in strong opposition to any continuance of this case,” Karapetian said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine, who expressed frustration that he first learned about the civil suit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/09/whistleblower-lawsuits-blow-lid-off-ucsb-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> newspaper articles, argued that the defense needed time to conduct its own investigation, particularly since Levine was without the resources and results of the internal affairs investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawyers for the University of California Board of Regents, including Bernal, filed an opposing motion on Oct. 18, arguing that because many of the officers named in the motion were not involved in Galoustian’s investigation or arrest, Herman should exclude them from his decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Herman emphasized that the defendant had a right to “exculpatory” information — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">evidence that clears the defendant from guilt in a criminal trial — which</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could arise from an investigation of Hashimoto. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine also said the defense would be interested in calling Hashimoto as a key witness for the trial, even as Karapetian stressed to the judge that the prosecution would not be calling him or using his statements because of the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian, who is currently facing 33 felony charges on behalf of two victims, was brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair wearing a large brace on his right leg at the Wednesday afternoon court appearance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Levine, Galoustian has been “very ill” and received medical treatment. Levine did not comment further on Galoustian’s condition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trial is currently scheduled to begin on Jan. 8, 2020 and is expected to take approximately 15 court days. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Oct. 24, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using custom sensors, Waitz is able to monitor Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, which it converts into occupancy data. The app calculates the number of students active on each floor and is constantly updated, refreshed every 10 minutes. It is 90% accurate, according to the app’s website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Waitz app is currently only available for iOS download, but Android users can still access occupancy rates online through the library’s website. Librarians have promoted the app through their website, UCSB’s subreddit r/UCSantaBarbara and on special monitor screens that display the occupancy rates in the library. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developer of Waitz and former UC San Diego alumni, Max Topolsky, first thought of creating an app that could monitor occupancy when he was a senior at UC San Diego. The app first launched at UCSD in August 2017, making UCSB the second UC to use Waitz’s services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We developed this when we were students at UC San Diego, and [at] UCSD we have a really big library and walking around when it was crowded was always a pain,” Topolosky said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So myself and two other people thought that … we can actually do something, so we started experimenting with some different technology and we found something that actually worked,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The library has been searching for products to help students with space occupancy and the library’s head of communications, Hanna Rael, shared that she has been approached several times by students “looking for some way to see online how busy the library is at any given time”; so, when she “received a direct email from Waitz,” she felt “super excited about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The librarians are also using the data collected by Waitz to understand why certain floors are used more than others and to find ways to improve the use of floors are utilized at lower rates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll be able to see historical data about space occupancy … [and] we can see if there’s parts of the library that over time seem underutilized and that might point to other issues that we could look into. Like maybe there’s not enough power in that area, maybe there’s not enough light or maybe the temperature control is not good in that area,” UCSB librarian Rebecca Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Waitz app is currently only used at the library, but plans are in place to expand to other locations around campus in the future, Metzger added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If students like it, we will probably be looking at ways to see if we can share the funding with other partners on campus who are interested in seeing it continue after the first year.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90611\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90611\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/","id":1878,"author":{"id":238,"name":"Crystal Martinez"},"related":[1877,1876,1875],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sigma Pi Removes Fraternity Member Following Sexual Assault Allegations","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-23-at-11.55.41-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-23-at-11.55.41-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Doe said she has not approached the university or the local police.

I could have punched him in the nose … or I could have started screaming, or at least yelled ‘get the fuck off of me.’ But I don’t know what it is … there’s this shame of, ‘I should’ve stood up for myself because I respected myself.’ And the moment I didn’t, so what does that say about what happened, you know what I mean?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get him to let her go, Doe said she told Smith that she needed to say goodbye to her friends “because they’re waiting for me” and told him she would “come right back.” She left and texted a group chat at 11:42 p.m. that night “CODE RED” and “where are you guys” in messages she showed the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She returned to her house with a group of friends, “and we were in my room, you know, crying, and I was a little in shock, like I had no idea what was going on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another friend who discovered Doe in her room during this time spoke to the Nexus and independently verified Doe’s recounting of the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Doe’s friend went to get her water, she learned of a second woman returning to their house who had allegedly also been sexually assaulted by Smith after Doe left the Sigma Pi fraternity house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said it was this instance that pushed her to report the incident to Macke the next morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t gonna say anything, which looking back is crazy, you know what I mean? Because you should always say something,” Doe said. “Right when I found out it was beyond me, I was like, ‘I need to report this.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next morning, she called a close friend in Sigma Pi, who arranged a meeting between her and Macke. She said she met with Macke at noon, and at 3:41 p.m. that day, she received a text from her friend in Sigma Pi saying “he’s dropped,” referring to Smith.</span></p>\n<p><b>How Greek Life Responded: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the events of Oct. 3, Sigma Pi canceled its Midnight Madness party — one of the parties typically held every year by nearly all UCSB fraternities following the completion of rush week – Macke said in a message to the other Greek life presidents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two weeks later, on Oct. 17, the university sent out an alert about </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/two-incidents-involving-date-rape-drugs-reported-at-fraternity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two reported incidents involving date-rape drugs on Oct. 5 at an unnamed fraternity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The university’s alert sparked heavy backlash on social media both from students and local community members, with many taking issue with the fact that the university had not included the name of the fraternity involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe told the Nexus that the incidents of sexual assault that she reported to Macke were unrelated to the reported use of date-rape drugs mentioned in the alert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the university alert, the UCSB Interfraternity Council (IFC) announced in an email on Oct. 18 to all IFC members that they had decided to place a five-day suspension on “all fraternity social activities” between Oct. 18 and the morning of Oct. 23. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to suspend all social activities was made “in light of an unprecedented level of misconduct from fraternity members and concerns from local law enforcement and University administration about systemic issues within the fraternity system,” according to the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the circulation of the fraternity member’s Facebook profile, rumors have spread around campus and Isla Vista regarding the location and alleged perpetrator of the sexual assaults. Sigma Pi’s name was mentioned by several social media accounts; one social justice-oriented Instagram account scheduled a protest walk against Sigma Pi before canceling it later that day to “give time for the victims to heal,” they wrote in a </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B32hT8YH80r/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said she agreed to speak with the Nexus because she needed to set the record straight. She emphasized that what happened to her “isn’t a Sigma Pi problem, and it’s not a Greek life problem. It’s a hookup culture problem.” She added that Macke and other Sigma Pi members have “been there every second of the way.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That shit probably happens all the time — at parties that aren’t even Greek-affiliated, you know?” she said. “What’s crazy about this is I’m grateful in a weird way that he was in a frat, because it was taken care of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though nobody knows it’s us, we’ve gone out with friends and they’ve been like, ‘Did you hear about those girls who got raped?’ That sucks […] I don’t want it to be like that — I want it to be like, ‘Did you hear about that guy that did that horrible thing?

400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and quickly washed away </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a sidewalk adjacent to fraternity Sigma Pi. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to fill in the gaps, students jumped to social media and ignited a firestorm of posts that called for the university to play a more transparent role in informing the student body </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beyond sharing a list of “safety tips” attached to the bottom of the timely warning. Others began pointing fingers at specific fraternities on Twitter; although unconfirmed, some tweets went viral. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A timely warning from the university is a product of deliberation and consideration, according to Miles Ashlock, associate dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university elicits a timely warning on a “case-by-case basis” based on factors surrounding the incident, which include “the nature of the crime, the serious or continuing threat to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to release the timely warning with undisclosed information stems from the Clery Act, a campus security law that aims to facilitate transparency in campus crimes and statistics, according to the Clery Act’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://clerycenter.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571898031086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHySLJ3MlOIp8a4Zzggc0tQ8AZzXw\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, student leaders in registered campus organizations, such as a fraternities or sororities, are not mandated to report instances of sexual violence and sexual harassment and instead attend annual trainings “in interpersonal violence prevention strategies,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a crime occurs on “Clery geography,” which, according to the Clery Act’s website, includes non-campus buildings “owned or controlled by a student organization,” the university makes a judgment call to “evaluate if there is a serious or ongoing threat to the campus community,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our communications, we strive to be sensitive to the impact that the message may have on survivors and to be careful not to create the potentially false sense of security (by naming one location over another, particularly when we may not have sufficient information to like the offense to a particular residence),” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students President Alison Sir said she met with campus administrators following the release of the timely warning out of concern for survivors and those unaffiliated with Greek life who feel “uncomfortable” about the situation. In a meeting with Assistant Vice Chancellor &amp; Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, Sir said she learned the timely warning was not specific to one fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The timely warning is about multiple IFC frats and frats outside [of IFC] — like in [multi-cultural] groups. [The university] didn’t want to release the names because I know a lot of students are angry about that because they’re all under investigation,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also addressed the “victim-blaming” nature of the timely warning’s “safety tips,” which she said the university opted to include after learning of one allegation that claimed a fraternity had laced a bottle marked with an “X” on it and would choose “who would get [the bottle] or not.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was basically IFC frats and frats outside of IFC as well, nothing was finalized [and] they were still investigating, so they didn’t want to release any names of people involved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Sir addressed Senate regarding the timely warning. She said she is working with Klawunn and Armistead to develop a “task force” of administration members, community leaders and students to review policies and practices addressing sexual violence in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir told senators that the task force will “encourage safer behavior and develop better response practices.” At this time, Sir was unsure who would be appointed to the task force, but said she will ensure that every “stakeholder” in the issue would be involved in the task force. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When further questioned by Senator Benjamin Chocron, Sir added that these stakeholders include IFC and Panhellenic members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also advertised an upcoming Sexual Assault Town Hall, hosted by Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) – to be held on Nov. 14 at 6 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The news brought by the timely warning drew an immediate response of “abhorrence and disgust” in the eyes of SASA’s president, Alia Reynolds, a third-year global studies and philosophy double major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We condemn any and all individuals or organizations which knowingly allow such actions to take place, or foster an environment which allows individuals to feel they can take such actions,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many students who spoke up on social media, Reynolds concluded that the university’s response was “not adequate” and that “[SASA] firmly advocate[s] for the university to release the name of the fraternity organization[s] associated with the incident.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds said SASA has created a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sasa-ca.org/index.php/svsh-map/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571899623049000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3PY3zJdSKCobVCHpizGDfPV5mTg\">“Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Map”</a> which allows survivors to “anonymously submit the date, location and any details they wish to disclose about an instance” of sexual violence or sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The frequency of incidents similar to those described by the timely warning call for “a larger conversation regarding the prevalent cultural and social context within Isla Vista and many other communities,” Reynolds said. “We believe a larger cultural shift in accountability </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must take place within our community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, a message responding to the timely warning was chalked </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and quickly washed away </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a sidewalk adjacent to fraternity Sigma Pi, emboldened with the words “hold frats accountable.” The chalking belonged to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/catcallsofsantabarbara/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571899698047000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNB-6PuIpmW2S0nHEJL271ArepsA\">@catcallsofsantabarbara</a>, an Instagram account that posts anonymously submitted stories of sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two representatives of the account, who wish to remain anonym</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ous to avoid retaliation, told the Nexus they first heard about the timely warning after receiving multiple screenshots of the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After speaking with a “few members of the Greek community,” one representative of the account said they were under the impression that Sigma Pi was the fraternity mentioned in the timely warning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two days after making a post about an incident at Sigma Pi, the representatives received information that contradicted their original beliefs regarding the fraternity, subsequently leading them to retract any posts implicating the fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conflicting information, which came from a “very credible source,” made it clear to the representatives that the situation ran “a lot deeper than we expected” and was not limited to one specific fraternity, the two stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday, the Instagram account announced a “boycott” against Sigma Pi, where they planned to march from Sea Lookout Park to the Sigma Pi house, but the march was cancelled “to give time for the victims to heal,” a post on the account’s page read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many on social media, Spencer Brandt, board president for the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said he was “horrified” by the timely warning and supports students’ calls for the university “to name the fraternit[ies]” where the incidents occurred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD is partnering with Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, an organization dedicated to providing counseling and support services to survivors of sexual assault, Brandt added. The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/csd-finalizes-contract-with-ucpd-for-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpersonal violence investigator program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a collaboration with the UC Police Department and I.V. CSD, has been in place since 2018 to investigate cases relating to sexual violence, according to Brandt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The truth is that no one deserves to be made into a survivor. We all need to take a hard look at the I.V. culture and ask ourselves what about it enables so much sexual violence.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence and Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><i>Correction [Oct. 24, 1:26 a.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that President Alison Sir partnered with SASA for the Survivor Town Hall.

Levine, claims that the officers, due to the accusations of “misconduct, dishonesty, and improper investigative techniques,” “intentionally violated” Galoustian’s right to due process and a fair trial, according to a motion filed with the court on Oct. 3. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine attached copies of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed by former UCPD Officer Ryan Smith, referred to as John Doe in court documents, as well as articles by the </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/09/whistleblower-lawsuits-blow-lid-off-ucsb-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the Daily Nexus describing the lawsuit, as supporting documents for the motion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motion names Officers Ryan Hashimoto, Michael Little and Tiffany Little as well as Lieutenant Mark Signa and argues that “the defense needs the requested information to properly prepare for trial on this matter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, the defense argues that because Hashimoto allegedly circulated a video “of an alleged sexual assault that was evidence in [Galoustian’s] case,” the video tapes have been “tampered with and no longer reflect the original content.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the motion, Levine also referenced an allegation in the UCPD lawsuits that said “many reports were being taken by UCSBPD officers, sanctioned by Signa, where males were being listed as rape and sexual assault suspects, despite no evidence of a crime occurring.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Traits of dishonesty, misconduct, false sexual assault reports, and improper investigative techniques are very relevant issues in this matter, as is whether or not Hashimoto and the other officers and employees of UCSBPD tampered with video or audio evidence in this and in other cases,” Levine wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motion requests: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The name, address and telephone number of all persons who accuses any above-named officer of acts constituting misconduct.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name, address and telephone number of all persons who were interviewed as potential witnesses to any of the aforementioned accusations of misconduct.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name, address and telephone number of all persons who accuses any above named officer of making false, misleading or inaccurate statements (or committing any other misconduct, such as threatening or coercing or interfering with witnesses), orally, in writing or in any other form, during an official, internal affairs or any other investigation conducted by the Investigating Department or any other agency.

Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://carbajal.house.gov/uploadedfiles/degrees_not_debt_act.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bill</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aims to “give middle-class families access to the maximum Federal Pell Grant” and “increase college transparency,” according to the bill’s text. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Efforts to increase the Pell Grant award have been introduced in Congress before; Congressman Carbajal introduced the </span><a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr2260\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Middle Class </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating Higher Education Affordability Necessary to Compete Economically (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.H.A.N.C.E.) Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 1, 2017, which would have increased the maximum award for Pell Grants, but the bill did not make it past that session of Congress. The </span><a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s3018\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Degrees Not Debt Act of 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, introduced by Senator Martin Heinrich on June 6, 2018, also fell short in that session. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carbajal, a UC Santa Barbara alumnus,</span><a href=\"https://carbajal.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=15121\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> relied on Pell Grants</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help pay for his college degree and “understands firsthand the difficulty students face when contemplating how to afford a higher education,” according to his personal website. The new $10,000 amount is meant to reflect the average cost of in-state tuition at public, four-year institutions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t wait any longer to act on student debt, and the Degrees Not Debt Act is a solid way to make financial aid and college more accessible to more people. The cost to attend UCSB as an in-state student is more than $12,000, but the Pell Grant currently caps off at $6,195,” Carbajal wrote in a statement to the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to do more for our students, and I’m glad to have worked with student advocates across the state over the past year to make this idea a reality.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The re-introduction of a bill to increase the maximum amount of the Federal Pell Grant award comes during a time when conversations about both tuition and student debt are subjects of heavy debate on the national stage. This past summer, Democratic presidential candidates </span><a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/debt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elizabeth Warren</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bernie Sanders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> both introduced plans to cancel student debt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 72% of UCSB students received some form of financial aid through the university during the 2018-19 school year, according to UCSB’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2018.19.pdf\">campus profile.</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s a really big increase,” External Vice President for Statewide Affairs Daevionne Beasley said. “That is a lot of money, especially to a low-income student, these thousands of dollars matter.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The aid is only a bandaid to the larger institutional problem of charging people astronomical amounts of money for a good education,” he added. “I will always be an advocate for free college and free tuition… but until we can get to that point, the more financial aid, the better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the EVPSA office’s legislative agenda has not been finalized yet, Beasley said that the EVPSA office will be advocating for the Degrees Not Debt Act on future lobbying trips. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Updated [Oct. 19, 2:16 p.m.]</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

During the talk, the pair discussed the legacy of the movement and what has changed after two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two began by talking about their daughters. “When our investigation began, my daughter weighed 12 pounds” and “had never eaten a plate of solid food,” Twohey said. Kantor’s youngest daughter “liked grabbing phones so much that by the end of the summer, she had accidentally managed to FaceTime Ashley Judd.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good laugh from the audience later, Kantor then posed the question: “So when these girls are much older, what are we going to tell them about Harvey Weinstein?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weinstein was not the first to be accused of sexual misconduct. In particular, Kantor noted, the New York Times had published an article in April 2017 revealing how then-television host Bill O’Reilly paid out millions of dollars to women with numerous claims against him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With that in mind, the editors gathered a bunch of reporters — including me — and asked what now seems like a quaint question: ‘Are there </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> powerful men who have covered up inappropriate treatment of women?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a trail of whispers, Kantor explained that she eventually managed to hold off-the-record conversations with Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd, all of who “separately told me very harrowing stories about Harvey Weinstein and hotel rooms.” But for the most part, people were generally reluctant to share their experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair knew they needed to take a different approach than getting people on the record in order to implicate Weinstein. It was difficult enough to convince people to talk officially in the first place, but Kantor explained that they also needed concrete evidence in the form of settlements, human resource records and the testimonies of ex-Weinstein employees to avoid a “‘he said, she said’ kind of story.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two dug around and Twohey finally found the people who had been waiting 25 years for her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their cases, Kantor and Twohey could not print what they learned, but that’s not to say they didn’t learn anything. The first woman was legally prohibited from saying anything; the second woman’s husband denied any possibility of sexual assault due to a genuine lack of knowledge of what had happened to his wife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that by now, they had learned about the extreme restrictiveness of secret settlements. No matter how willing the victim is to speak, their silence was mandated by agreements signed years ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One call Twohey and Kantor made was to Irwin Reiter, Weinstein’s “gruff, loyal” accountant of 30 years. They did not expect him to help, but he ended up becoming a pivotal figure in the investigation, having become disillusioned with his boss after Weinstein’s obsession with sex became increasingly alarming. Reiter began sneaking Kantor details associated with Weinstein for the team to check out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night in September 2017, Reiter gave Kantor a memo to copy by employee Lauren O’Connor, who wrote statements along the lines of, “At this company, the balance of power is Harvey Weinstein: 10, me: 0.” The accusations in the memo, which described Weinstein’s acts in around 2014 and 2015, helped the investigation take on a new urgency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there were those seeking to undermine Twohey and Kantor’s progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Twohey, prominent attorney David Boies worked with Weinstein to silence his victims and, now, the New York Times piece by way of a $300,000-contract to former Israeli intelligence officials from private intelligence company Black Cube. Their objective was to “target” the sources and journalists behind the story and stop it from ever going to print. As Twohey put it, “It was basically a ‘hit’ on our project.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the final 48 hours before Kantor and Twoheypublished the story, the two presented Weinstein their findings and gave him a chance to tell his side of the story. As publication neared, Weinstein took on a more direct, confrontational role. Flanked by a small cadre of prominent attorneys and prosecutors, Twohey said he “barged” into the Times’ office with folders of photos showing women, some of them involved in allegations against him, smiling and acting happy next to him, along with information that was meant to discredit and embarrass them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were threatening lawsuits against us. They were basically bullying us and trying to attack us as individuals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of all of the work and risk put into the story, Kantor and Twohey still had doubts about whether anyone would care when the story was published. To the audience in Campbell Hall, Kantor asked, “Who here had never heard of Harvey Weinstein before this story?” Surveying the hands, she concluded, “A substantial number of people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were additionally concerned that not enough people would go on the record. Laura Madden, the only person who had agreed by that point to do so, nearly changed her mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twohey and Kantor learned their fears were unjustified, however, when Madden sent the pair a note that read, “I realize that time is short. I want my daughters to grow up in a different world. I am happy to go on the record.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Judd, meanwhile, came forward at the last minute as well, stating that “women have been talking about Harvey Weinstein for a long time privately, and it’s past time to start having the conversation publically.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the article was published.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turmoil ensued within the Weinstein Company and board members were split on what to do. Weinstein himself refused to go down quietly, Twohey and Kantor explained. “There are going to be women’s organizations that have my back,” he said, defending himself. “There are going to be dozens of them, and there’s gonna be a movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And … and there was!” Twohey responded with amusement along with the audience. “But not the kind he was predicting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Largely inspired by the revelations brought forward in the article, the #MeToo hashtag began trending on social media, used by both celebrity and non-famous individuals to share their own stories of sexual harassment and assault. But, two years later, what’s next?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kantor, there is a “mounting sense of unfairness about the issue on both sides”: Supporters and victims believe society hasn’t gone far enough in addressing sexism and power, and detractors, especially those accused of wrongdoing, believe society has gone too far without a “clear and sound process in place for evaluating these kinds of complaints.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citing increasing divisions within the movement, Twohey asks people to consider and reconsider the weight of sexual misconduct allegations, the vetting process and the extent to which those accused should be held accountable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kantor ends with her own questions on the legacy of #MeToo. Will her kids still see sexual harassment and assault as everyday occurrences? “Or, will we be able to say, ‘I was there when things changed?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t have all the answers to these questions,” Twohey contends; a journalist’s goal, she said, is to get the full story and have the reader draw their own conclusions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one thing Kantor wants to make clear is this: “You can’t solve a problem you can’t see.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

future physicians fight a common affliction in doctors: burnout. </span><em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to its </span><a href=\"https://professional.ucsb.edu/certificate-medical-humanities#ready\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the new Medical Humanities Certificate provides students with a “foundation in humanities which can lead to increased empathy, more understanding of historical and social contexts of disease, and a better resiliency to burnout.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Jason Prystowsky, the certificate coordinator, said the program quickly came together after a “year of strategic planning.” He explained that he and his colleagues saw a need for humanities in the medical field, for the benefit of both pre-medical students and their future patients. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s kind of an existential threat, almost, of young professionals who have an incredible command of the science and technical expertise and are brilliant and creative but don’t understand the power of narrative or social context, or how poverty is related to health,” he said</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prystowsky said the certificate is well-designed to compliment pre-medical students’ schedules, and it gives students the freedom to pursue sub-specialties of the humanities that interest them and relate to their career goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To obtain the certificate, students must take two extension courses in the fall and spring quarters, in addition to ten units of approved UCSB </span><a href=\"https://ucsantabarbaraextension.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018938314-Medical-Humanities-Electives\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electives</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from various disciplines that relate to the certificate material, according to the website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not a major, it’s not a minor, it’s a certificate,” Prystowsky said. “So students who have a very robust science and lab schedule can squeeze it in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fall quarter course for the program, Introduction to Medical Humanities (</span><a href=\"https://enroll.professional.ucsb.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&amp;courseId=31799263\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">INT X410</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), is currently taught by an interdisciplinary team of nine university faculty members, according to Prystowsky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the certificate courses have a different teaching format from the required classes for pre-medical students, the classes use readings and films that are catered specifically toward pre-medical students, Prystowsky said. The curriculum for INT X410 even includes watching an episode of the television series “Scrubs,” which Prystowsky believes offers a great view of popular culture narratives surrounding medicine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will not give you a book to read or a lecture that does not have the intent of making you a better physician one day,” Prystowsky said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second class, to be offered for the first time in Spring Quarter 2020, is Medical Humanities in the World (</span><a href=\"https://enroll.professional.ucsb.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&amp;courseId=31799270\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">INTX 411</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). The class will focus on how the humanities can be directly applied to the medical field, exploring topics such as spirituality, mortality and structural racism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every different community is going to have a different way of looking at health, and a different narrative and have a different historical context,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another goal of the program is to equip future physicians with the ability to fight a common affliction in young doctors: burnout. Part of the spring quarter course, INTX 411, will focus on preparing students to be resilient in their future professions, Prystowsky said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In a lot of ways, burnout is compassion fatigue,” Prystowsky said. “I think having a better understanding of historical context, cultural appreciation, poetry, art and literature, is another tool in that toolbox that young physicians can use to thwart burnout.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Prystowsky said students pursuing the certificate do have to pay for the extension classes — though fundraising for the new program is in progress — students are encouraged to pursue Humanities and Fine Arts (HFA) scholarships to offset costs; a 50% discount was also offered to all UCSB students for INTX 410 this fall, according to the certificate website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A medical humanities curriculum is currently required at 69 out of the 133 accredited medical schools in the country, and Prystowsky believes future medical students will benefit from building a foundation during their undergraduate time at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is value in giving students exposure to it before they set foot in a medical school campus. We’re planting seeds.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90504\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/new-professional-certificate-gives-pre-medical-students-a-foundation-in-humanities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90504\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/new-professional-certificate-gives-pre-medical-students-a-foundation-in-humanities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/new-professional-certificate-gives-pre-medical-students-a-foundation-in-humanities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/new-professional-certificate-gives-pre-medical-students-a-foundation-in-humanities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/new-professional-certificate-gives-pre-medical-students-a-foundation-in-humanities/","id":1961,"author":{"id":234,"name":"Madeline Thompson"},"related":[1960,1959,1958],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Food Bank area. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Basic Needs Resource Center (BNRC) would place various Associated Students (A.S.) resource entities under the purview of the current A.S. Food Bank, which would be renamed to the “A.S. Food Bank and Basic Needs Resource Center” and include the A.S. Food Bank, Child Care Grant, A.S./Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) Emergency Grants, the Community Financial Fund Grant and the Graduate Student Association Food Pantry, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. President Alison Sir began working on the BNRC over the summer along with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So Marisela and I created a proposal this summer when we realized that this $1.2 million from UC Office of the President was going to be sent to each campus, and we decided this would be a great opportunity for A.S. Food Bank,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the opportunity to centralize A.S. basic needs resources, Sir hopes the center will eventually consolidate financial workshops and CalFresh advocates in one place for students to access. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BNRC would not be in a different location but would move into the current A.S. Food Bank area. One key element of the BNRC is a case management system, which would track what students are accessing in order to assess student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was authored by On-Campus Senator Adalis Rojas and seconded by Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi and calls senators to “support its expansion and work to reach out to the UCSB community about these opportunities,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas’ resolution also addresses a separate A.S. project </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an A.S. book grant, which will provide funding for students to purchase textbooks.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas told her fellow senators during Wednesday’s meeting that this resolution is a way to “centralize what students’ needs are instead of everything being scattered about.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I spoke to Alison and Marisela and we did consider making it two separate resolutions, but they both advised for me to just include it under one, so that’s just how it came out to be,” Rojas said to the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said one of her key senate campaign platforms was textbook affordability, so when  Márquez approached Senate last week about authoring resolutions for the BNRC and the A.S. Book Bank, she decided to write both into one resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do know that food insecurity and textbook affordability is a huge, popular issue among the senators that we all want to solve,” Rojas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution states that the current EOP Emergency Grant can be used for textbooks but only if a textbook has been lost, damaged or stolen </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not in the case of students who cannot afford textbooks at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has not yet announced how the new book grant funds will be allocated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Hadidi referenced last Friday’s Basic Needs Town Hall, held at Corwin Pavilion, where students addressed both campus and local leaders about accessibility to basic resources to combat food insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many students have a lot of issues with what’s going on in their lives on campus. I think there’s a lot of concerns about housing and homelessness for students and right now we can’t address that, so I think supporting this resolution is really important,” Hadidi said to her fellow senators during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has not unveiled a timeline for either the BNRC or the book grant to be set in motion.

Well, the UC Santa Barbara Surf Team is bringing both with their Stoked N’ Broke benefit concert on Oct. 20. Grab a friend or five and head on down to 6559 Segovia Road from noon until 5 p.m. for live music from I.V.’s best local bands, as well as a closing set by guests from San Luis Obispo. For just a $5 entrance fee, you will be automatically entered into a raffle to win prizes such as a surfboard, surf lessons and a private photo shoot, among other rad prizes you don’t want to miss. So don’t sleep on the center of UCSB’s stoke and help keep I.V.’s resident shredders in the water and competing statewide. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Carbs Against Carbon</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love pizza? Hate contributing to a massive carbon footprint? What a coincidence, so does UCSB’s Excursion Club! Isla Vista’s resident outdoor enthusiasts will be hosting a fundraiser at Woodstock’s on Oct. 24 from 5 p.m. until 10 p.m. to support the Carbon Fund, a nonprofit leading the fight against climate change. Excursion Club is encouraging all clubs on campus to go carbon-free, and what better way to get that mission across than with pizza?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Beautiful Bodies Clothing Swap</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In honor of Love Your Body Week, the Isla Vista Trading Post (IVTP) will be teaming up with the Women’s Center for another one of their famous clothing swaps. Taking place in the Student Resource Building Multipurpose Room on Oct. 23 from 5:30 to 8 p.m., the event encourages folks of all shapes, sizes and identities to come out and learn all about sustainable clothing practices, as well as how clothing can reflect body positivity. Abiding by the IVTP’s golden rule of “three for free,” attendees will be able to walk away with three free items of clothing. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Have A Laugh!</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embarcadero Hall will be transformed from dowdy lecture hall to hip and happenin’ comedy club on Saturday night, thanks to Laughology, UCSB’s premiere standup comedy group. Highlighting the show will be Trevor Wallace, who is best known for his “ain’t no laws when you’re drinking Claws” viral video in support of White Claws (which earned him a cease and desist order from the hard seltzer connoisseurs). The show, which will take place from 8 to 11, is free! </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/","id":4244,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4243,4242,4241],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In Photos | Women’s National Soccer Team Co-Captains Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan Lead Soccer Clinic","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Alex-Morgan-Megan-Rapinoe_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Alex-Morgan-Megan-Rapinoe_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Nexus photographer Ida Kazerani captured the excited energy of the clinic.

id=\"caption-attachment-90472\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One major focus of the event was the resilience of the native and indigenous communities.<em> Ida Kazerani/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the first year that the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) was responsible for planning this event. American Indian Student Association (AISA) EOP peer mentor Jeike Meijer, a fourth-year global studies and feminist studies double major, worked with another peer mentor to plan the celebration. Meijer served as the Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs for the 2018-2019 school year and was the first Native American to serve as an Associated Students executive at UCSB — a focal point of her campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Through 500 years of colonialism and a tribal genocide, my people are supposed to be gone, but I’m still here, so [Indigenous Peoples’ Day] stands to me as resilience and I remember my ancestors, my family and how much they fought so that I can be here,” Meijer explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One major focus of the celebration was the resilience of the native and indigenous communities, which attendees touched on by sharing stories from their personal histories. Allison Dutra, a second-year zoology major who attended the event, found the emphasis on family origins particularly impactful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it was really cool how [attendees] touched on their roots, the efforts that they’re putting in today to help kind of restore [what] once was here,” Dutra said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One attendee used their time to speak out against Chancellor Henry Yang’s involvement with the Thirty Meter Telescope Project, currently in construction on Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii – a sacred ground for native Hawaiians. Yang currently serves as the chair of the telescope’s board of governors; his role sparked backlash from UCSB students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other AISA members touched on the importance of UCSB students being aware of the past Chumash roots of the campus. Linda Murray, an alumna who was involved with AISA during her time at UCSB, believes that UCSB students have a responsibility to honor the Chumash. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We respect [the Chumash] and their culture and know that they’re still here. Natives are not in the past tense — we’re alive and nationally have networks,” Murray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that the role of academia on campus translates to a heightened responsibility to learn about the realities of indigenous history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we’re taking in knowledge, we’re learning and hopefully providing [information] for future generations to say that Columbus Day isn’t okay anymore,” Meijer explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the I.V. Community Services District began acknowledging the Chumash people’s roots to I.V. at the beginning of each meeting with a statement meant to “pay our respects to the Chumash elders, past, present  and future, who call this place, Anisq’Oyo, the land that Isla Vista sits upon, their home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To many in attendance, an important part of the celebration was to recognize the historical inaccuracies in regards to indigenous people, to correct this history and to understand their right to occupy spaces on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The history [needs to] be written correctly for students to know before they get to the university,” Murray said. “It’s really important for us to exchange with each other and to feel that we also belong here when we are actually the original descendants.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

between the Associated Students (A.S.) Department of Public Worms, the A.S. Food Bank and the UC Santa Barbara Sustainability Internship Program and trains students in practices that address the social, economic and environmental aspects of sustainability, according to Katie Maynard, advisor of the Edible Campus Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the great things about a farm is it gives students an opportunity to have a hands-on connection with the natural environment and where their food comes from. Sometimes, the changes in a student’s life can be as simple as getting a better appreciation for the work that goes into creating their food,” Maynard said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening of the farm, located on West Campus at the corner of El Colegio and Storke Road, featured a variety of booths to educate visitors on sustainability and composting, local wildlife in the area as well as providing activities for children, such as pot-painting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Jack Johnson, singer-songwriter and UCSB alumnus, performed at the opening, singing several of his most popular songs, including “Banana Pancakes,” as well as an original song about composting to fit the theme of the event. Johnson and his wife Kim are both major donors to the project and have visited the farm to help out and check on its progress several times in the past four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding for the farm came from the UC Global Food Initiative, A.S. Coastal Fund, the Green Initiative Fund, the Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce, the Healthy Campus Network and the Fund for Santa Barbara Youth Making Change Board, among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a speech at the grand opening, Chancellor Henry T. Yang emphasized that the farm will contribute to other sustainable food practices already established at UCSB and in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are working to ensure that all students have access to healthy and sustainable foods </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from growing food here on campus to campus food pantries [like] Associated Students Food Bank and Miramar Food Pantry to help[ing] students register for CalFresh,” Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maynard said that the farm will continue to grow in the future, with plans for a total of 37 raised planter beds, ranging from 16 to 20 feet high. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Edible Campus Program is also planning on working with other departments on campus for projects using the farm, according to Maynard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We’re] working with Dr. Chandra Krintz from the computer science department. And we’re actually going to be putting a weather station …  and collecting data that through various meters throughout the farm that computer science students can use to then make recommendations about how we may change our farming practices.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 7</em><em> of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

introductions from each panelist with a description of the work they do. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall was hosted by the Office of the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA), which is led by executive Christian Ornelas; alongside a panel featuring a number of prominent local officials, several campus organizations tabled to advertise the local resources available for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the main portion of the town hall, students directed questions about basic needs — which encompass housing, food insecurity and money — to a panel of five members: Monique Limón, an assembly member representing Santa Barbara and Ventura; Salud Carbajal, a representative for Santa Barbara; Joan Hartmann, Santa Barbara county district supervisor; Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs and Mike Miller, vice chancellor for enrollment services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) General Manager Jonathan Abboud and Board Director Jay Freeman were in the audience, but there was no representation from I.V.’s local government on stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said his office did not initially plan to host a town hall this year — until a policy proposal from the Free SB campaign earlier this summer changed that. Following conversations with fellow Associated Students (A.S.) executives and input from Hartmann, Ornelas said his office got to work on the town hall event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall kicked off with brief introductions from each panelist and a description of the work they do at their respective levels to help alleviate the insecurities that are often associated with basic needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a political standpoint, Hartmann, Carbajal and Limón all stressed the importance of food assistance programs such as the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and its California branch, CalFresh, which aim to shed weight from the insecurities of food affordability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you have qualified for [SNAP and CalFresh], the benefits [can be] used at a grocery store, the food co-op, the farmer’s market and the food pantry,” Hartmann added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the university side, Klawunn and Miller highlighted various programs and resources UCSB offers to students in need. Voucher programs, which support housing and meals, for example, can be used by students during times of crisis to help get them through their next meal or next month’s rent, according to Miller, who chairs the Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Task Force at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we’re trying to do is get as much direct aid to students as we can around food and around housing,” Klawunn added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the panelists’ introductions, students lined up behind the microphone to speak directly to the panel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first question asked to the panel was about the responsibility of the government to support basic needs and its efforts to carry those responsibilities out.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every five years, the government passes what is called the Farm Bill. And a good, significant funding of the farm bill is the SNAP program … it’s absolutely imperative that we look out for those who are most vulnerable amongst us and that we work together to provide a safety net,” Carbajal said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conversation then turned to housing when an audience member asked about affordable housing for campus workers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn responded by talking about the proposed construction of additional housing on Ocean Road, where units would be offered for rent at more affordable prices, despite the “staggering” cost of living in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limón, a member of the Housing and Community Development committee at the State Assembly who said she has voted in favor of “167 different bills to advance housing,” believes there is no one solution to remediating the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Housing for “workers, for students, for staff, for anyone — it is a greater conversation and the state has really tried to make some investments,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As questions came in, one student asked the panel how Black students — one of the most underrepresented demographics at UCSB — would be supported through basic needs initiatives and remain “secure” in interactions with university law enforcement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann responded with an acknowledgement that “people of color have it much worse” in the context of basic needs. She moved on to highlight local law enforcement’s transparent approaches through new initiatives such as the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/foot-patrol-to-launch-restorative-justice-program-offering-alternative-punishment-for-ordinance-violators/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Foot Patrol Restorative Justice Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Party Registration Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn added that the UC Police Department’s new chief of police, James Brock, is taking a different approach to law enforcement by consulting students to “hear their voices” and better embed the police department in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a question directed to Miller, one student asked what the university can do better to spread awareness for resources offered on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller acknowledged that spreading awareness for campus resources is the university’s “number one problem” in the context of basic needs. He noted that many initiatives, such as the </span><a href=\"https://hacsb.org/section-8/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Housing Voucher program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have been difficult to advertise to students because the programs were recently created. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat this, he noted that the university works with student interns to spread awareness to the rest of the student body on a grassroots level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the town hall drew to a close, one final question regarding the role of citizenship in eligibility for resources was brought to the panel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limón cited Assembly Bill 540, an 18-year-old piece of legislation that “allowed high school students who graduated in California to enroll [in college in California] with in-state tuition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a different </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB540\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 540</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom this October, undocumented students will now have the opportunity to be eligible for certain grants and programs beginning next academic year, according to Limón.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, through UCSB’s incoming “meal plan scholarship,” Miller said the university is trying to establish “parallel programs” to CalFresh and SNAP by offering a campus alternative for undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure undocumented students are on a level playing field,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Carbajal took his turn to respond, he said that documentation and citizenship should not come before helping others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t want to live in a country where we look at each other and not think of our humanity,” he said, drawing the town hall to a close. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no tangible change that came directly from the town hall in regard to helping students with their basic needs, although politicians and university administrators were presented with a clearer picture of what problems are affecting students the most.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas isn’t entirely sure what his office plans to do following the town hall but is actively “thinking of ways to move forward.” He intends to hand over his office’s work on basic needs to the A.S. Lobby Corps co-chairs who “will be able to give a lot more time and focus to a basic needs campaign.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Thursday evening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incidents, classified as “aggravated assault” per the Clery Act, occurred on Saturday, Oct. 5.
