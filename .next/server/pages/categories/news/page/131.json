Senate meeting propositions a new entrance to the A.S. Main Office and addresses an IRS ruling to pay A.S. Program Board via stipend. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met in the Flying A Room at the UCen last night to discuss potential campus construction projects and issues surrounding A.S. Program Board member payment.</p>\n<p>Among topics discussed during last night’s meeting was a proposal for new construction of the A.S. Main Office, currently located in the MultiCultural Center (MCC), in order to create a space providing easier access for students. In addition, an Internal Revenue Services (IRS) ruling to pay A.S. Program Board members via stipend instead of honoraria was also addressed.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said her proposal for additional construction to the A.S. Main Office would extend the building to create a new campus entrance.</p>\n<p>“This is not an expansion of the presidential office,” Guthy said. “It’s actually demolishing the Office of the President to create a new entrance to A.S. Main [Office] to make it more accessible for students.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, while there is no money currently underway to be spent on the project until further consultation from all of A.S., she wants to “explore the idea” and has an image in mind for the construction.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to create a huge main entrance next to the ticket office,” Guthy said. “Then we would probably enclose that top balcony area to create more of an office/conference room space, because currently it’s really underutilized.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting there was also an issue regarding an IRS ruling mandated that A.S. Program Board staff get paid through stipend instead of via honoraria.</p>\n<p>Chairman of the Senate’s Finance and Business Committee Jimmy Villarreal said the IRS does not believe the work A.S. Program Board does mandates an honoraria-based salary and that A.S. needs to change the way they are paid.</p>\n<p>“The fact that they have staff that directly supervises them … Program Board is one of the few [groups] that actually has a staff and supervision,” Villarreal said. “So for those reasons and others, the IRS doesn’t want them to be paid through honoraria. Instead we’re going to pay them through stipend, or at least that’s the idea right now.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said there needs to be a change in A.S. Legal Code language regarding how payment is issued to students in student government.</p>\n<p>“I’m actually going to ask some senators … to draft new language for the bylaws to instruct that we are actually managers of our own time and resources,” Guthy said. “That’s a big confusion for the IRS, as they are under the assumption that for stipend-earning students, that we have a staff supervisor.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, although the IRS disagrees, A.S.’s independence justifies the continuation of their specialized honoraria-based salaries.</p>\n<p>“That’s the completely amazing thing about student government is, we are our own bosses and our own supervisors of our own time,” Guthy said. “We don’t report to a staff member.”</p>\n<p>In regard to the Program Board stipend issue, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez said she is looking to further discuss how to pay students in A.S.</p>\n<p>“I am in the middle of a conversation with execs and finance board … to discuss the budget process as well as a new element, which is the stipend class of students,” Marquez said. “We’ll be discussing that a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh also talked about what his office is working on in the coming months, including events and campaigns like Gaucho Consent, which will help educate students about sexual violence. Singh said his office will possibly host a Red My Lips Campaign to bring awareness to sexual assault awareness month in April.</p>\n<p>“The idea is combating the slut-shaming that goes on in regards to gender-based violence,” Singh said. “Basically women are invited to wear red lipstick all week or all month to kind of counter that image.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on

Project SERV is a financial award typically granted in as emergency funding to assist educational institutions facing a crisis. The grant enables existing campus-based mental health services provided by Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) to expand by temporarily hiring additional staff members.</p>\n<p>Director of C.A.P.S. Jeanne Stanford said it is “both sad and impressive” that the D.O.E. has an office to respond to violence in schools.</p>\n<p>“Many schools, colleges and universities have benefited from these funds to increase mental health services after episodes of violence,” Stanford said in an email. “This award is critical to our ability to continue to serve the increased needs of our community in the aftermath of the tragic violence in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Student Affairs will propose to use the grant money to lease office and reception space on the second floor of the I.V. Clinic at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said. Fleming also said the grant will allow for expansion of campus staff to provide mental health and wellness services as well as more campus advocacy and prevention services to students.</p>\n<p>“The shared suite would house four counseling psychologists from CAPS, a sexual violence advocate and a sexual violence educator from C.A.R.E. and an additional student mental health coordinator, along with a receptionist/administrative assistant,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fleming said the facility could be used to host a variety of services in addition to mental health, including campus community-building events and activities.</p>\n<p>“Both C.A.P.S. and C.A.R.E. would anticipate scheduling group activities and meetings, as well as some programs open to the broader community in the meeting rooms and in the nearby church building once it is renovated as a community center,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Wellness Services Angela Andrade said she is “thrilled about the grant” and that the funds will be used to support new counseling psychologists, a social worker, a counselor for faculty and staff and an additional staff member in Student Mental Health Coordination Services (SMHCS).</p>\n<p>“SMHCS provides outreach and support for students in distress and those concerned about a student in distress,” Andrade said. “The grant will allow us to assist more students and community members and extend our services into Isla Vista where many of our students live.”</p>\n<p>According to Stanford, C.A.P.S. requested two additional psychologists specifically to increase availability of counseling appointments and same-day crisis intakes for students dealing with acute stress.</p>\n<p>She also said C.A.P.S. requested resources for outreach to students, staff, faculty, teaching assistants and student groups in order to allow students to be “re-stimulated by returning to Isla Vista and campus, especially in anticipation of the year commemoration of the May 2014 tragedy.”</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S. will] increase the number of grief and trauma groups offered for those affected,” Stanford said in an email, “and increase number of places/locations on and off campus where psychologists are available.”</p>\n<p>The increased mental health support services on campus will help reduce and possibly prevent the longer term psychological effects tragic instances like the May 23 shootings have had on campus, Stanford said.</p>\n<p>“Together we will continue to grow stronger,” Stanford said in an email. “The funds will enable us to continue to spread the message of care for our fellow Gauchos, continue our Pathway to Healing, and encourage our community to speak up for each other as we all can benefit from an encouraging word or voice of concern.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, January 15, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The week will conclude with the Afrikan Black Coalition Conference at UC Irvine, an annual gathering black students from across the state aiming to build leadership skills among students over the weekend.</p>\n<p>According to BSU outreach chair and third-year sociology and black studies major Jamelia Harris, the week not only aims to educate students about prevalent issues related to police brutality and racism, but is also meant to encourage students to take action through strategy building and development.</p>\n<p>“Our main goals are to raise community consciousness, develop strategies to enforce police accountability, develop a task force on police brutality, and create productive spaces where we can continue this dialogue and share ideas and visions with one another,” Harris said in an email. “It’s about inspiring developing leaders to emerge.”</p>\n<p>The week began on Monday with English professor Felice Blake facilitating a workshop on individual rights and was followed by a lecture on Tuesday by black studies and sociology professor George Lipsitz, who spoke about “education as a tool for dismantling systems of oppression.”</p>\n<p>According to Lipsitz, BSU’s week of education and action is an illustration of students’ desire to instigate change in the local and national political climate.</p>\n<p>“It shows that intelligent young people don’t want to be passive spectators to what is happening in this world,” Lipsitz said. “It is extremely encouraging for me to see these students engaging in self-education and activism that is designed to know about the world but also to change it.”</p>\n<p>Lipsitz also said BSU’s grassroots mobilization is a vital part of prompting societal change, especially in light of recent events regarding police brutality that have put issues of race in the national spotlight.</p>\n<p>“We spend a lot of time looking for leaders,” Lipsitz said. “But we can solve our own problems. Nobody is going to do for us what we fail to do for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Harris, the involvement of Blake and Lipsitz in the week of events is crucial for the continuation of the Black Lives Matter movement, a black rights movement ongoing since the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 and amplified by the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner last year.</p>\n<p>“Dr. George Lipsitz has been called to serve and guest speak in Ferguson following the non-indictments, and Dr. Felice Blake holds a significant position in the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and has devoted much of her work to servicing marginalized communities,” Harris said in an email. “We’re blessed to have faculty members who have demonstrated their commitment to progression within the Black community through several avenues.”</p>\n<p>According to Harris, police brutality against citizens occurs both nationally and locally, including in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“SB is not innocent or estranged from the poisons of police brutality,” Harris said in an email. “In 2013, the amount of deaths caused by SBPD was double that of deaths caused by civilian murders.”</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara Police Department Sgt. Riley Harwood said the statistic is not valid and cannot be linked to police brutality.</p>\n<p>“In 2013 we had two officer-involved shootings, one of which the suspect was killed,” Harwood said. “In 2013 we had more people killed in vehicular homicides than officer-involved shootings, so I don’t really know where that [statistic] is coming from.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major and BSU member Harper Howell, the topics discussed during the week allow students like her to question the role of law enforcement in American culture.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the fact that all police are bad people, it’s just we need to question the way that they are being taught,” Howell said. “So that’s something as a nation we need to start getting involved in, and I’m glad we’re doing it here.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, January 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB also ranked second highest in the UC system for most African-American student applications.</p>\n<p>According to Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services Mary Jacob, the university’s 85,208 applications reflect a larger amount of non-California applicants than ever before, with 18,420 of the applications coming from out-of-state and international students.</p>\n<p>“We continue to attract students from outside California, from other states in the United States,  and even from other countries abroad,” Jacob said. “There’s interest outside of California from people who would like to study here and study specifically at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Jacob said 10,930 of the non-California applications were from international students, exceeding the 7,490 out-of-state applications. She said this is due to the U.S.’s greater availability of higher education in comparison to universities and colleges abroad which tend to be more competitive.</p>\n<p>“American students, no matter where they are, have a range of choices of good quality universities to apply to in the same country, and that may not always be the case for other countries,” Jacob said. “It’s too competitive for them to go to the really good universities in their home country, so they look to study abroad in the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia or Canada if they’re looking to go to an English-speaking country.”</p>\n<p>UCOP spokesperson Shelly Meron said despite California residents’ criticism of UCOP for increasing acceptance of non-Californians, these acceptances are financially necessary as higher out-of-state tuition will allow the UC to provide funding for resident students amidst recent state budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“Admitting non-resident students helps UC subsidize California students and make up for some of the significant cuts in state funding the university has experienced in the last few years,” Meron said. “It’s also important to note that non-resident students are not taking the place of California students at UC; these are separate enrollment targets.”</p>\n<p>Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships Michael M. Miller said the amount of financial aid students receive will not be affected significantly by the larger pool of applicants, as the university will continue to enroll a consistent number of students to allow the university to properly fund them.</p>\n<p>“The campus is really good about hitting all our enrollment targets,” Miller said. “So while enrollment may fluctuate by a couple hundred students here or there, for the most part we know how many students we’re going to have and we can effectively fund them with financial aid. It’s not that big of a deal for financial aid.”</p>\n<p>According to Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop, the increasing number of applicants allows the university to select more academically adept students, leading to an increase in the value of a UCSB degree in the job and graduate school market.</p>\n<p>“The academic prestige of the campus will continue to rise high and you’ll see more high-achieving students in our classrooms,” Przekop said. “It means the value of your UCSB degree will continue to rise as you begin your career and/or apply to graduate programs.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said the only downside accompanying the increase in applicants is that the university will have to deny more students.</p>\n<p>“Competition for admission to UCSB will increase,” Przekop said. “Unfortunately, excellent applicants will be denied admission. It never feels good to deny access to wonderful applicants.”</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, the increase in applications can be attributed to the university’s growing public relations efforts, including an increased social media presence, a recently added virtual campus tour to the admissions website and the presence of more visits from California high schools and community colleges than in the previous year.</p>\n<p>“We have been more visible and active in our California outreach efforts,” Przekop said. “This fall we visited approximately 100 more schools in California than last year.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said the greater number of applicants can also be accredited to the university’s recognition worldwide, helped in part by recent Nobel Prize for Physics recipient Shuji Nakamura.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is recognized by top student scholars as a world-class university,” Przekop said. “We have a new Nobel Prize winner, which certainly drew global attention.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he attributes the record amount of applications to the university’s highly ranked education, prominent diversity, effective research and faculty.</p>\n<p>“This year’s record number of applications is a testament to UC Santa Barbara’s stature as a world leader in academic excellence and diversity, cutting-edge research and innovative teaching,” Yang said. “We are proud to be a campus of choice for talented and high-achieving students with diverse backgrounds who enrich our community.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, January 15, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/","id":2941,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2940,2939,2938],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Psychology Alum Turns Singer-Songwriter: The Beauty of the Party-Study-Play Music Balance at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"More than any other California school, UC Santa Barbara students have a tendency to get defensive about their alma mater.

It’s a delicate topic. Is this a party school, or is this a world-class research university? The answer usually gets tied down in the celebrated Gaucho motto, “Work hard, play hard.”</p>\n<p>But what this four letter chant fails to observe is the enormous artistic community that is alive on campus and in our quaint seatown Isla Vista. I.V.’s special aura of friendliness and creativity allows things like Bean Night, the Catalyst Literary Arts Magazine and beach drum circles to exist. The magic of being a student at UCSB is that the wise are able to benefit from three interlocking environments: red-cup atmosphere, reputable research and a music scene that never stops playing.</p>\n<p>Enter Sarah LaForge, a UCSB alumnae from 2011. Inspired by her father’s career as a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapist, LaForge went straight to the Psych Info table when she came for Spring Insight in 2007.

It became a side project along with all this work I was doing to graduate.”</p>\n<p>Upon graduation in 2011, LaForge headed straight into the career world, going into social work for disabled and autistic children in Riverside, California. “It was overwhelming . . . it was so hard on me emotionally that I felt like I had no outlet at the end of the day. I was so worried all the time about these kids,” she said.</p>\n<p>Facilitating her hobby found at UCSB, LaForge ended her social work term and moved to L.A. to write music. Taking on the stage name of “Lucy,” she formed “Lucy &amp; La Mer” in 2012 as a solo act. Other musicians have been added into the mix in the last couple of years, including Grammy-nominated drummer Matt Cook and bassist Jon Lee Keenan. Lucy &amp; La Mer has played in 10 countries throughout Europe and recently just finished a San Diego to Seattle tour with Australian musician Dolly Denko.</p>\n<p>Throughout it all, she’s kept in contact with her mentors at UCSB, and even played at Hartson’s wedding. “I remember my fiancé at the time and I were talking about potentially having a band play at our wedding and Sarah had just posted a new song on Facebook so I sent him a link to her music and he liked it,” said Hartson.</p>\n<p>“It just so happened that Sarah was playing a show in L.A. that weekend so we drove down to see what she was like live and we loved it. I remember asking her at the end of the set to play our wedding and she was excited to do so and we were thrilled. It was really lovely to have such a personal connection to the band playing the wedding. It wasn’t just hiring some random band and we knew we could count on her to really make the wedding special and she did.”</p>\n<p>Besides performing at weddings for good friends, LaForge funds her traveling adventures by hosting amateur music lessons for small children. “In L.A. there’s a lot of parents who want their toddlers taught what music is. I bring fun percussionist instruments, teach them a few chords, and say, ‘hey let’s write a song together.’” She also recently landed a spot as backup singer for 49-year old EDM legend Moby.</p>\n<p>While her life is very different from the days at UCSB testing heart sounds, LaForge hasn’t lost the affinity for study she gained in her degree. In an interview with UCSB’s psych department newsletter, she said, “There’s a surprising amount of research within the music business. Finding your audience is just like finding your sample group – age, location, interest, disinterests, are all important when creating marketing strategies. You’re always hypothesizing about how your group will react and asking questions as you plan.”</p>\n<p>LaForge’s future plans involve combining her UCSB Psychology degree with her passion and training to become a music therapist. But for now, she’s enjoying the hectic lifestyle as a freelance teacher and musician-on-the-road.</p>\n<p>“After you stop school, you’re looking for something [to do]. I don’t have a test Friday, so what am I looking towards, what do I wanna work on. Music became that,” said LaForge. “You never feel balanced, necessarily. But you feel thriving. You’re doing a million things at once, you’re juggling. It’s not as structured as being in school or having a 9-5 job. But I love it.”</p>\n<p>Thriving is the optimum word to describe Sarah LaForge; a UCSB student whose top-notch education and unique environment cultivated her into a singer-songwriter with a research-savvy edge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>To get into contact with Sarah LaForge, go to</em> facebook.com/lucyandlamer</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Just Friends (Single) by Lucy &amp; La Mer\"

id=\"caption-attachment-59711\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of UCSB Philosophy Department.</p></div>\n<p>Graduate student Jason Andrew Bennett, a fifth-year doctoral student in philosophy, died on Dec. 31 after committing suicide at age 32.</p>\n<p>Bennett received his Bachelors and Masters degrees in philosophy from UC Santa Cruz and enrolled at UCSB in 2010, where he earned a second Masters degree and became a Ph.D candidate with the philosophy department. Bennett’s primary research interests included the intersection between language logic and the limits of linguistic expression. Bennett also left a suicide note on his blog “<a href=\"http://notes.dedicto.org/the-note\">de dicto</a>“<strong> </strong>along with a lengthier post attached to the note providing instructions on how to distribute his possessions, including a number of paintings he created and posted to his blog.</p>\n<p>Philosophy Department Chair Thomas Holden said Bennett’s death was unexpected and that Bennett was a bright student and respectable person.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be holding a faculty memorial to share stories about Jason soon,” Holden said. “He was a brilliant student. He really was. He was a little quiet guy, very dignified and respectful. He was a stand-up guy … We’ll miss him.”</p>\n<p>Nathan Salmon, graduate student adviser for the department of philosophy, said Bennett was among the most talented students of philosophy that has been seen in the department.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s fair to say that I’ve never known a graduate student with more raw ability in philosophy than he had,” Salmon said. “And I’ve known many who are very, very talented. He was right up there in terms of raw talent. That was obvious really, from the start. He was very humble … to the point where people didn’t realize quite how talented he was.”</p>\n<p>According to Salmon, Bennett had a rough childhood and had “overcome extreme adversity.”</p>\n<p>“He grew up in an abusive home and he ran away from home at age 16,” Salmon said. “But he had to leave behind his younger siblings — he wasn’t old enough to take care of them himself. He really wasn’t even able to take care of himself.”</p>\n<p>According to Salmon, Bennett never gave any indication that he was tormented about his past and that his death took everyone by surprise.</p>\n<p>“By all appearances it looks as if he had completely overcome it,” Salmon said. “He was so capable. He just looked like he had a very promising future ahead of him.”</p>\n<p>According to Salmon, Bennett’s blog post on his website “de dicto” on Dec. 31 makes clear that he put time and thought into the decision before taking his life.</p>\n<p>“His suicide message was very methodical, very well-planned and thoughtful,” Salmon said. “It was clearly something he had been thinking about for quite some time. He took all of the kind of precautions and measures to make it easier for people who survived him to deal with his death and donated his body to UC San Francisco Medical School.”</p>\n<p>Salmon said that while graduate students are commonly under pressure, he does not believe Bennett’s death is a result of an insecurity about his studies.</p>\n<p>“I think it would be a mistake to conclude that he was under the kind of depression that comes from insecurity, not feeling that he wasn’t valued enough from his teacher,” Salmon said. “He knew his teachers thought very well of him and expected good things from him. He knew he was impressive to them, so it was probably something else. He didn’t talk to anyone about what tormented him.”</p>\n<p>According to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) psychologist Janet Osimo, people who commit suicide often think about the decision for a long period of time and see no other alternatives. She also said childhood trauma can affect individuals long after the events occur and that some individuals have a genetic predisposition to depression.</p>\n<p>“For them they see it as that they’ve tried everything and that people that they leave behind will be better off,” Osimo said. “A lot of times a reason that they want to be dead is so they can be out of pain. Past traumatic events can absolutely effect individuals long after they’ve happened and some people may be more prone to depression through family genetics.”</p>\n<p>Osimo said people feeling depressed or having suicidal thoughts should talk to someone or reach out to a suicide hotline, 911 or use the 24/7 CAPS counseling number.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times people wait until they’re in crisis to seek help” Osimo said. “Research shows that it’s better to seek help sooner, your symptoms will alleviate faster and stay away longer. However, if someone is facing a crisis and feeling like they want to end their life, they should call a suicide hotline or dial 911 for immediate help.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/","id":2950,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2949,2948,2947],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Groups that received full funding included El Congreso, receiving $10,000 for their Raza College Rally, the Japanese Language Café receiving $250 and finally Chicano/Chicana Grads, which received $14,077 to hold an alternative graduation for Latino/Latina students. Cotillion Dance’s request for $150 for a non-dance social at the Student Resources Building was tabled after representatives for the club failed to show up to the meeting. The other groups will now wait to hear back from the Board and will receive responses to their funding requests when the A.S. Senate meets this Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Student comedy group Laughology requested $6,510 for their six upcoming shows after explaining that they had an impressive lineup including Dana Gould, a writer for the Simpsons, and Grammy Award winning comic Tig Notaro.</p>\n<p>“Winter quarter is historically slow for just about everything. It’s really hard to get people to come in — not true for us,” a spokesperson for the club said. “It seems like we are on a bit of a snowball effect here and we’ve got a really crazy order of comedians lined up. It is probably the best quarter we have ever booked.”</p>\n<p>The American Institute for Chemical Engineers (AIChE), a student association of chemical engineering students, asked for $842 for funding for an annual Southern California regional mixer that will be open to all students on campus at all year levels.</p>\n<p>The event will feature AIChE representatives from six universities and 80 chapters, according to AIChE Internal Vice President and third-year chemical engineering major Dilpreet Kaur.</p>\n<p>“Specifically right now, it is a very important for us to go because our current president is resigning due to personal issues and we have two other people stepping up in leadership,” Kaur said. “This conference will give a great opportunity for them to talk to other leaders and the other organizations and see how we can complete our events for this year and get advice on running our chapter.”</p>\n<p>The Lindy Circle, a Goleta-based dance organization, came to request $2,632 for a dancing event with a band they have every quarter. Representatives for the club said this year’s event will feature a premier swing dance act led by jazz guitarist Jonathan Stout.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Ensemble Troupe, a women’s student theatre organization on campus, requested $3,000 to put on the Vagina Monologues, an ensemble performance play featuring women’s personal perspectives on love, sex, rape, gender and other issues, held each Winter quarter.

Tony Borrayo died in the early hours of the morning while he was asleep at home with his family last Sunday on Jan. 4.</p>\n<p>A cause of death has not been determined. During his time with UCPD, Borrayo received numerous awards and accolades, including a Supervisory Certificate from the California Peace Officers Standardized Training and the prestigious H. Thomas Guerry Award, given to officers by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors for excellence in law enforcement.</p>\n<p>According to Borravo’s colleague and UCPD officer Sgt. Mark Signa, Borrayo was an “amazing member” of the Isla Vista and Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant Borrayo has been a friend and part of the UC/IV community for almost 20 years,” Signa said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to a statement released by the Office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Borrayo is Santa Barbara born and raised, and graduated from Dos Pueblos High School in Santa Barbara before attending Santa Barbara City College. He began his career at UCSB in 1994, when he worked at the UCen and in the Parking and Transportation Services before eventually becoming a police officer with UCPD.</p>\n<p>According to Assistant Director of Student Programs Marilyn Dukes, Borrayo was a highly regarded member of UCPD and said his passing was unexpected.</p>\n<p>“[I] have worked with Tony at events for many years, so his passing came as quite a shock,” Dukes said. “Tony was very committed to his work and to the campus community and my sympathies go out to his family and the UCPD who are, no doubt, feeling his loss very deeply.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang’s statement, Borrayo represented both the department and the community at multiple events and ceremonies throughout the state. Borrayo also helped in the creation of the UCPD Honor Guard, and recently joined an advocacy group to aid undocumented students and Dream Scholars.</p>\n<p>A memorial service was held on Friday, Jan. 9 at St. Raphael Catholic Church in Goleta. UCPD officers wore memorial patches over their badges in his memory.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/","id":2947,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[2946,2945,2944],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Discuss I.V.

Self-Governance Bill. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students met in the Associated Students Main Office in the MultiCultural Center (MCC) yesterday to discuss different services that could be helpful to Isla Vista and to develop clearer goals for CA state Assemblymember Das Williams’ self-governance bill for I.V.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) seeks to create a Community Services District (CSD) governance for I.V. which would empower a local governmental board exclusive to I.V. to authorize and execute services and infrastructure projects for the area using locally sourced revenues. Williams’ office is facilitating multiple discussions with different stakeholders, with today’s discussion focusing on capturing student perspectives on what type of services they want in I.V.</p>\n<p>Other issues discussed at the meeting included the role of housing and utility taxes to pay for services, creating a community center and “safe space” in I.V., altering community policing and creating bicycle lanes on the streets.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said he thinks that while specific services like a community center or underground facilities could be helpful in I.V., it is important to focus on the long term future and explore how a CSD will be sustained moving forward.</p>\n<p>“For me, the big picture here is [that] even if I think it’s a realistic approach, we’re not going to get all these services at one time. There just isn’t enough money in the world for that,” Schunk said. “But what we can do is prioritize a few and say that these are the most important to us and from there what we can do is really create a system that will benefit those in the long term.”</p>\n<p>One of the concerns raised at a prior stakeholder’s meeting last week was that AB3 was coming from Williams and his office without enough contribution from students and other I.V. residents.<br>\nBut according to Ashley Kruzel, a State Assembly field representative for Williams, since Williams’ office is facilitating the bill and because it has to go through the legislative process, it must come from Williams’ office or CA state senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s office, as she represents Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Das can introduce a bill, I can’t introduce a bill, you can’t,” Kruzel said, “It has to come from Das or Hannah-Beth because obviously no one else gives a shit about Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>During the forum at the MCC, Schunk discussed the potential of implementing utility taxes in a future CSD-type of self-governance for I.V. as opposed to implementing a property tax. With a utilities tax, I.V. residents would be able to see exactly what they are being charged for instead of unknowingly increasing the overall cost of living without transparency, Schunk said.</p>\n<p>“I think that for a lot of people [a utilities tax] will provide that transparency that people are looking for and I think that a lot of people would desire [it] as opposed to property tax that may be a little bit more elusive,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>EVPLA office member and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said she wants to convince students that these taxes could be beneficial in the long run.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s really important, because how are we going to tell students, ‘This is what’s going on. Self-governance is going on and your utilities are going to go up,’ plus tuition’s going up,” Melgoza said, “so we just have to find an effective way of making them see like, this is going to help long-term.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he believes students should consider the perspectives and needs of long-term residents when thinking about changes to the community.</p>\n<p>“I know there’s a lot of antagonism between students and long-term residents and I just want to remind everyone … that they are people, that they have lives and families like you, that they have hopes and dreams like you do,” Schunk said. “The one thing I want to encourage everyone to do is try to see them as people and try as hard as you can to really connect with them on a human level because you’d be amazed at how similarly they see this place to you.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said that having an open discussion on self-governance with every constituent of I.V. is vital to ensuring optimum success with the proposed bill.</p>\n<p>“I think the most important thing though is that we don’t let this become a students versus others kind of debate,” Schunk said. “I think moving forward, if students can keep in mind, that we owe it to this community to be members of the community. Then I think we’ll have much better dialogue also.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated Alejandra Melgoza is a second-year Chican@ studies and political science double major. However, Melgoza is a second year double majoring in Chican@ studies and history of public policy.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59689\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59689\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/","id":4803,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[4802,4801,4800],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up Jan. 9-11","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C232&ssl=1","description":"This past week, law enforcement officers with UCSB Police Department (UCPD) and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to various incidents including noise ordinance infractions, abuse of the eld...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past week, law enforcement officers with UCSB Police Department (UCPD) and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to various incidents including noise ordinance infractions, abuse of the elderly and theft.</p>\n<p>According to a weekly crime report, during the night shift last Wednesday law enforcement officers attempted to issue a noise ordinance violation on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive. During the confrontation with a resident of the home, the officers noticed a student attempting to conceal half an ounce of marijuana for which he did not have a medical card by destroying it. When the officers approached the individual, he provided a false identity and was subsequently arrested.</p>\n<p>The following day, officers stopped a vehicle from “Jump on the School Bus” transportation while it was loading passengers on Ocean Road and Trigo Road. The bus was playing excessively loud music and honking its horn to catch the attention of potential nearby riders, which led to the officers on patrol to question bus driver Nicholas Zwart. UCPD officers cited Zwart for not having insurance, and warned Zwart against loading the bus on campus.</p>\n<p>This past Friday officers logged 9 arrests and 22 citations, with a notable charge for abuse of the elderly. Officers were called to check the welfare of a 68-year-old amputee and Vietnam War veteran at Friendship Manor on Friday night. The victim’s caretaker, Russell Tokle, had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Upon entering his apartment, the officers found it unsanitary to the point of being uninhabitable, littered with things like cat feces and rotten food. Tokle was arrested for his previous warrant and is under view for elder abuse. The victim was granted an immediate move out of the apartment and taken into the care of Adult Protective Services.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, officers responded to a noise citation on the 6500 block of Segovia. Around midnight, the resident said he would turn down his loud music, but at 2 a.m. the music resumed its high volume. Officers returned to the residence, shut down the party and issued a noise citation. As party-goers filed onto the street from the party, law enforcement officers noticed one man too intoxicated to take care of himself. While attempting to place him into the patrol car, a fellow student interfered, attempting to stop officers from arresting the man. Following the altercation, both students were arrested for a drunk in public citation and a citation for interfering with law enforcement, respectively.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, IVFP units responded to a theft call at the Subway on Pardall Road. Upon arrival, officers found the victim fighting with the suspected perpetrator and ended the conflict immediately. During the investigation, deputies determined that the suspect was in possession of the victim’s backpack, an iPhone and several other stolen items. The suspect was then arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Officers also responded to a call about a male breaking a window at the 7-Eleven on Seville Road this past Saturday. IVFP deputies located the suspect, Larry Anthony Ortiz, who was covered in blood and appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. Ortiz had broken a window at 7-Eleven, along with a window of a nearby car parked on Sabado Tarde. Ortiz was arrested for vandalism and later charged with battery against a police officer after spitting in the deputy’s face.</p>\n<p>Deputies responded to another report of vandalism on Sunday, this time at the Isla Vista Clinic on Embarcadero del Mar. Upon arrival, police observed another broken window and blood spatter in the area. Deputies believe this incident to be related to the vandalism arrest from the night before.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59688\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59688\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/","id":4796,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4795,4794,4793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Student Regent-Designate Meets With Students","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Student-Regent_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Student-Regent_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Student Regent for the 2014-15 school year Sadia Saifuddin and UC Student Regent-designate for the 2015-16 school year Abraham “Avi” Oved met with students on campus at the Student Resource Bui...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_59665\" style=\"width: 626px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Student-Regent_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1740903437\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59693\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59665\" data-attachment-id=\"59665\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/student-regent/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Student-Regent_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1165&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1165\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"UC Student Regent Sadia Saifuddin and Student Regent-designate Avi Oved explain the application process to an audience.

During their open forum Saifuddin and Oved explained the student regent application process and discussed the responsibilities that accompany the position in order to reach out to a more diverse pool of applicants for the 2016-17 Student Regent application. Issues facing UC students were also discussed, including mental health, food security and the recently approved tuition increase plan.</p>\n<p>Saifuddin said the main issue facing UC students today, which she has focused on extensively during her term as a regent, is food security. According to Saifuddin, she is looking to address issues of food inaccessibility for students on campuses in which food prices tend to be high.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a problem that students have to make a decision between books and food,” Saifuddin said. “Students should never have to skip a meal. I’m working on creating a system-wide food security model that still has the flexibility for each of the campuses to adapt for their own culture and their own needs, but has some kind of coordinated response so that students don’t go hungry.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik, who attended the forum to learn about how students can mobilize to support student regents, Saifuddin and Oved are using a different recruitment approach this year, meeting with students across the system in an open forum, as well as forums specifically for African American, Asian Pacific American, Chicano/Latino, American Indian/Native American, Middle Eastern and undocumented student minority groups.</p>\n<p>“They are looking for a very diverse group of applicants this year and that’s the exact reason why they’re doing this tour … to talk with students that are on the ground, students that perhaps have not understood what this position entails and to get them interested,” Abdalmalik said. “I think that they have done a very good job of doing so, especially when talking to students that are normally underrepresented such as Middle Eastern students, undocumented students.”</p>\n<p>During the forum, Saifuddin said her experience as the only member of the Board of Regents outside of ex-officio members to vote “no” on the proposed tuition increase was difficult but necessary.</p>\n<p>“You’re kinda backed up against the wall when you’re a student regent,” Saifuddin said. “Students don’t need another tuition increase. It really puts a crunch on middle class students and our campuses really have a big chunk of middle class students.”</p>\n<p>According to Saifuddin, students from an upper-income level family could likely handle an increase of $600, which is approximately what the tuition increase would be annually, but that it puts unnecessary pressure on middle-income students.</p>\n<p>“It seems kinda affordable, but for middle-class students that’s like one month of rent and that’s a lot of hours of work,” Saifuddin said. “Work-study jobs do not make that much. It’s very rare to find a work study job that makes over $15 an hour, and that’s on the high end. It was kind of personal for me because I had gone through a tuition increase and I had to work. I felt that craziness, and really depression.”</p>\n<p>Saifuddin also said she is concerned by what she perceives as continued divestment in the UC by the state over the last 10 to 20 years.</p>\n<p>“The state is slowly dwindling the funds and increasing the budget for things like the Rainy Day Fund that the governor put another like $1.2 billion dollars into in the recent budgets, or prisons, which are really big, actually one of the things at the top,” Saifuddin said. “But when you work with students so intimately you understand what their personal struggle is and I just can’t support that.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Oved is currently working on addressing safety on UC campuses, an issue he said he tackled while working in student government at UCLA and will continue to focus on when he becomes the official Student Regent in July of this year.</p>\n<p>“One thing that we did is develop a mobile panic button safety application,” Oved said. “It was an idea I got from the UC [blue light] phone booths, but those aren’t practical. What we wanted to do was heighten safety resources at UCLA and make it more relevant so students are more equipped with resources. So in the event of an emergency they would be able to respond.”</p>\n<p>According to Oved, the mobile safety application was created in partnership with Circle of 6, a free app that aims to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. The application, according to Oved, “centralizes” emergency communication efforts with six friends that become informed of a person’s location via GPS if they press a button indicating they need help.</p>\n<p>Oved said the application also centralizes safety information with campus resources like Community Service Organization (CSO) and Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE).</p>\n<p>“It’s these resources that I was told by multiple students, ‘I wish I had that, that night, when I really needed it,’ ” Oved said. “I think it’s a really valuable tool and really starts the conversation about safety awareness as well. It also falls under the umbrella of [the UC] President’s task force on responding to and protecting students from sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>According to Saifuddin, the Board of Regents is also discussing how to address student mental health issues and how to make counseling and other resources more available to students struggling with mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“Right now students make appointments for mental health counselors or psychologists and what ends up happening is they have to wait four, or five or six weeks, and then it’s finals time and it’s like, ‘Okay well, good job, nothing happened, we weren’t able to help students,’ ” Saifuddin said. “Every year there is a suicide on campus, so it’s really, really critical that we deal with this problem.”</p>\n<p>Oved also said working one-on-one with UC President Janet Napolitano can be refreshing, because unlike some members of the Board of Regents she is very candid when communicating with Oved and Saifuddin.</p>\n<p>“When we have meeting with her she doesn’t sugar coat her answers,” Oved said. “She is very straight forward. ‘Yes I agree and we’ll support this’ or ‘No I don’t agree and this is why.’ ”</p>\n<p>According to Oved however, the Board’s straight-forward way of communicating can also be “frustrating.”</p>\n<p>“Oftentimes that’s also a really frustrating thing in the student regent position is that you want to do so well and to advocate and to make a dent in your term,” Oved said, “but oftentimes there are people within the democracy who don’t really necessarily want to jump on board with you.”</p>\n<p>Second year biopsychology major Niki Elyasi said she thought the student regents did a “fantastic job” during the forums and are commendable for reaching out to more students in order to allow for a more diverse student regent applicant pool.</p>\n<p>“Bringing people who haven’t been involved in student government, [like] undocumented students [and] Middle Eastern students — I think that is just really, really great,” Elyasi said. “I give them huge kudos for spearheading that and for taking so much time out of what they do to just to reach out to people and make them see that this is something that you can actually do.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

First Fridays and featured a wide array of music by female artists, a hot chocolate booth, dancing, live art and a photo booth.</p>\n<p>Spatial art professor and creator of First Fridays Kim Yasuda said she wanted to find ways for people to heal after the I.V. shootings through events that foster positivity and security during weekends in I.V.</p>\n<p>“All that happened in the spring, that was so hard,” Yasuda said. “Knowing that so many students were coming back in the fall and there was just no vehicle for healing … I have always believed that our culture could provide a space for positive engagement in counter to what seems to be the sensibility when a tragedy happens.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said I.V. First Fridays made use of UCSB Nobel Prize winner and materials professor Shuji Nakamura’s invention, energy efficient LED lights, to brighten the block party. The Womyn’s Commission constructed an outdoor lounge in the park, complete with couches and LED Christmas lights wrapped around the skeleton of a geodesic dome.</p>\n<p>According to the supporting coordinator of Womyn’s Commission, third-year global studies major Cassie Rubio, the social atmosphere of I.V. can cause some students to feel threatened, which is why the organization felt it was important to host an alternative event.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times Isla Vista can feel very unsafe and predatory so we decided to create a cool vibe where people can hang out and meet each other but also being conscious about the different issues surrounding them,” Rubio said.</p>\n<p>Third-year film &amp; media studies major Ashley Baker, who collaborated with Yasuda for I.V. First Fridays and photographs the events, said students were at liberty to organize the event in any way they saw fit.</p>\n<p>“She gave us free reign to do anything that we wanted and she encouraged our creativity, which is something that I’m not used to,” Baker said. “When did most professors ask the students ‘It’s anything that you want to do’? We made up our curriculum and activities for this.”</p>\n<p>According to Womyn’s Commission co-chair and third-year comparative literature and global studies major Danielle Maldonado, the event is used as a platform to advocate for women’s rights and representation.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to take this opportunity to empower women, so all of our performers are female,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>Rubio said she hopes to see more events like the block party in the future, where people can showcase talent that is not usually recognized while providing a safe alternative to the “I.V. party scene.”</p>\n<p>“I hope that this won’t be the last block party,” Rubio said. “I hope that more and more venues like this are set up for female performers to be celebrated and shown off to I.V. because we have a lot of talent that doesn’t get enough credit they deserve.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59626\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59626\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/","id":4795,"author":{"id":175,"name":"Rishika Kenkre"},"related":[4794,4793,4792],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

A.S. Executive Director Maricela Marquez also spoke briefly about concerns surrounding last November’s Mac DeMarco concert, during which police apprehended the artist after he climbed the rafters of The Hub.</p>\n<p>Marquez announced efforts to establish better communication between UC Police Department and the A.S. Program Board, which put on the concert, in order to prevent future mistakes on the part of security personnel including the chief of police for UCPD and Program Board officials.</p>\n<p>“We sent a general memo to all those personnel to see if we could do some cross-training about how things work and what impact one of our decisions make on others and so on and so forth,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy was present at the meeting to inform the Senate about a possible I.V. rebranding project and potential university-sponsored events to be held during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Guthy questioned whether a rebranding campaign is necessary and if money raised for such a campaign could be better spent on investing in certain I.V. programs.</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, I.V.S.A.F.E., a committee on I.V. safety led Santa Barbara District Attorney Joyce Dudley, is currently working on a rebranding initiative for I.V.</p>\n<p>“Today they proposed that this campaign would cost somewhere in the realm of $90,000 so they’re looking into where they would get those sources of funding,” Guthy said, “I expressed concern over whether students would rather see that money going toward actually creating programs to benefit I.V. rather than tell the world that it is better. So we’re not really sure where we will be going with that.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said university administration is examining potential alternative entertainment programming, similar to what was held during Halloween, for this year’s Deltopia, an event typically held the first weekend of Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>“The university has reserved a lot of campus venues like Harder Stadium and Campbell Hall for alternative programming that weekend and I think A.S. Program Board is looking into hosting some sort of concert or alternative event similar to Halloween,” Guthy said. “Nothing’s been set yet but plans have been developed.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said he encouraged off-campus senators to attend town hall meetings organized by California State Assemblyman for Santa Barbara Das Williams, to discuss efforts toward I.V. self-governance. Schunk also said the first of these meetings for Winter Quarter is scheduled to take place Feb. 5, followed by subsequent meetings on the Feb. 15 and March 5.</p>\n<p>Schunk also said he would like to see expanded service offering by the A.S. Pardall Center, including the purchase of its current building, which A.S. leases, to create a more permanent A.S. presence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would like to look into the idea of the Associated Students being able to increase and expand the services provided in the Pardall Center, specifically through an increase in fee initiative,” Schunk said. “One of the main things we would be looking to do is provide the opportunity for the Associated Students to also use that funding in the long term to perhaps purchase that building so that we no longer have to worry about renting that space.”</p>\n<p>The Senate also passed its only action item of the week, “A Resolution to Support Wage Equality Among UC Employees” without objection, which voices the Senate’s support for equal salaries for staff regardless of gender.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appears on page 4 of the Thursday, January 8, 2015 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Farr also discussed the process currently underway attempting to establish a form of local government in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, after the terrible events of last year, the issue really came to the floor again,” Farr said. “Associated Students became interested in it, trustees became interested in it, and so I thought well if there’s this much support, then maybe it’s time to take a look at it and see if there’s a way to craft something that would be unique to Isla Vista that would best fit the needs of Isla Vista and provide more representation on a wide variety of issues.”</p>\n<p>California State Assembly Member for Santa Barbara Das Williams, an alumnus and I.V.-native, introduced a bill early in December into the California state legislature seeking to establish I.V. as a community services district (CSD), a form of local government allowing an unincorporated area to provide services for itself independent of county oversight.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the bill does not yet outline the specific brand of self-governance I.V. will potentially take on, but rather serves as a proclamation that can be amended when more concrete plans are established.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of a placeholder … after the series of meetings [Williams] is having are over with and the community has reached some consensus on what they want it to say, then he would amend the bill to include that in it and then it would start through the regular legislative process,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>While Farr said she commends the ongoing town hall meetings that have served as forums for students and I.V. residents to discuss forms of self-governance, Farr also said she is concerned that the expectations of Isla Vistans may not meet the reality of a local government once it is implemented.</p>\n<p>“I am supportive if the community can find some sort of consensus; I think my greatest concern is that a lot of people don’t understand what it could do and what it couldn’t do,” Farr said. “At the end of the day if something was formed I wouldn’t want people to be disappointed.”</p>\n<p>Farr said it is currently unclear exactly what a governing body in I.V. would look like, but said one possible scenario of self-governance could include a governing board made up of a variety of representatives from I.V. and the university.</p>\n<p>“I think people are looking for a body that sits locally,” Farr said. “I think in this case it might be some sort of board where there is representation from the county, the university, elected representatives from the community [and] some appointed property owners. I guess we’ll have to see what comes out of the discussions that Assembly Member Williams is having.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the creation of a local government in I.V. could also lead to the introduction of local taxes or fees that would help fund local services and projects.</p>\n<p>Farr also said one of the new services I.V. could benefit from is the introduction of a community resource officer, an individual “who could really be a full time, hands on liaison between the community and law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>Assembly Member Williams’s bill will be amended in the upcoming months to include detailed plans for I.V. self-governance as public discussions continue. The next town hall regarding the bill and its contents will be held Feb. 5 in a location in I.V. to be announced.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/","id":4793,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4792,4791,4790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate and meets weekly on Mondays to allocate funding to various student groups and other university affiliated projects. At the meeting, the board addressed finance requests and funded GIVE to Isla Vista, the Muslim Student Association, Model United Nations (MUN) and Unión Salvadoreña de Estudiantes Universitarios (USEU) among others. </p>\n<p>South Asian student group UCSB Indus requested $2,280 to fund a cultural dance and a cappella concert in mid-February as part of campus-wide cultural awareness week and was granted $1,880 of the request. </p>\n<p>The International Student Association also requested $1,564 to fund their “Welcome Back” concert in the Hub this Friday evening and was granted the full amount.</p>\n<p>GIVE to Isla Vista is an event held at the end of each academic year where donated student items from students moving out of I.V. in June are sold to the general public in a fundraising event for which the organization gives volunteers to staff the event. The event last year drew over 50 tons of merchandise and provided money to over a dozen student organizations. Of the requested $11,085, the board agreed to fund the group $8,766 to cover costs for a site coordinator, a volunteer coordinator, site clothing and a truck driver.</p>\n<p>The Muslim Student Association requested $1,062 for tickets and transportation to attend the 2015 MSA West Conference in mid-January, where MSA chapters from California, Arizona and Nevada will meet for three days to discuss relevant issues related to Muslim identity and collective history. The board passed a motion to fully fund the requested amount and to withdraw $230 in money previously allocated to the group last November.</p>\n<p>MUN requested a total of $25,294 for their upcoming events in spring quarter. The board decided to move $517 from the Office of Student Life spring account into an account for Academic teams, and to allocate $5,000 towards hotel fees for MUN. </p>\n<p>Unión Salvadoreña de Estudiantes Universitarios (USEU), an organization representing the Salvadoran student community, is holding a two-day annual summit that will include workshops and team building activities for groups from chapters at other campuses. The group requested a total of $1,022 of which $946 was allocated to be spent on muffins, orange juice, coffee, water and other assorted foods and utensils. </p>\n<p>According to fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau, 50 percent of the foods purchased can be from Costco, but the other 50 percent need to be purchased from local or organic sources. </p>\n<p>“That’s what you all are supposed to tell them during the finance and business workshops,” Lau said. “You say, ‘You still have to use organic foods,’ and they’ll say, ‘Oh, we’re getting our food from Costco, what about them?’ You still have to have 50 percent of it be USDA organic, local.” </p>\n<p>Lau said that although the Isla Vista Food Co-op is an option for students to buy organic food, it is not necessary to purchase food there. </p>\n<p>“It doesn’t have to be from the Co-op,” Lau said. “The Co-op is automatically local and organic, but you can get it from Costco and have it be organic.” </p>\n<p>The Board also passed a motion to fully fund USEU as a one-time exception for the food costs and plan to emphasize spending restrictions in future finance and business workshops. </p>\n<p>Other fully funded groups include the professional business fraternity Delta Sigma Pi; the Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology department for their 11th-annual Graduate Student Symposium; the Indus organization for their cultural show; and the International Student Association for their welcome back concert this Friday. Recreational computer hacking group SB Hacks also requested $2,000 to help fund an upcoming “hackathon” that promises to draw some 500-600 participants, the motion to fund was tabled indefinitely.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/","id":2590,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2589,2588,2587],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":131,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
