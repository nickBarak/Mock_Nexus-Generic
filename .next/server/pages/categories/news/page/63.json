His controversial, often profane communications with his residents are frequently caught on video and published on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, Gelb was charged with a misdemeanor after he was filmed hurling a barrage of homophobic slurs at I.V. Community Services District President Ethan Bertrand on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The video shows Gelb repeatedly calling Bertrand a “fag” and making lewd references to anal sex after Bertrand had told him that he treats his residents poorly. Bertrand, who is openly gay, serves on the I.V. CSD Board of Directors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident received considerable local media coverage and Gelb faced widespread community backlash. Gelb issued a statement in response, attributing his lack of filter to Asperger’s Syndrome and accusing Bertrand of calling him a “pedophile” and a “felon” before the video began — a claim Bertrand has since denied.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Days later, Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley announced the county would charge Gelb with one count of disturbing the peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Gelb’s arraignment has been continually delayed. He has not been present at any of the hearings. In February, his representation unsuccessfully filed to have the case dismissed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a Facebook group titled “Texts From Gelb,” I.V. residents share videos of Gelb’s public outbursts and screenshots of profane texts he had sent them. On Saturday, a user posted a video of Gelb using misogynistic slurs to tell residents not to sit on the roof of their complex.

President Hieu Le began gathering signatures for the project during the week of Feb. 26. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The University Center Renovation Project will be on the Associated Students spring elections ballot, according to A.S. President Hieu Le, who has been petitioning to get the project on the ballot over the past three weeks.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had the fortunate opportunity to speak with thousands of students on this campus,” Le said. “Now, students will be given that opportunity to decide the future of our campus and for the future of tomorrow’s generation.”</p>\n<p>Approximately 3,500 undergraduate students signed the petition, according to Le. In order to get the project on the ballot, Le needed to collect 3,116 signatures by the March 16 deadline.</p>\n<p>“[The number] is well above the mark that we needed to be, which only shows that there is a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of support from the campus, from the student body, around this proposal,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The project, a collaboration between A.S., the Division of Student Affairs and the University Center (UCen) Governance Board, was introduced as a resolution to the A.S. Senate during a Jan. 31 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/student-fees-may-spike-with-ucen-remodel/\">Senate meeting</a>, where it was tabled indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Senate passed a second resolution later than night, affirming support for the project. Le and volunteers began petitioning the ballot during the week of Feb. 26.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to hear what [students’] concerns are about their day to day issues, but at the same time we’ve been able to present this exciting and thrilling opportunity for students to consider voting for the UCen renovation expansion,” Le said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board and career staff members involved in the elections process verified the number of signatures and student perm numbers to make sure that each is valid, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“In our process we’ve been very diligent in the educational process in ensuring that students are informed about the issue, about the benefits and also what it would cost, and what the investment would be,” he said.</p>\n<p>Le said he and others who gathered signatures were “transparent” when petitioning to students.</p>\n<p>“Our process holds the highest standards of integrity,” he said.</p>\n<p>The petition outlines a need for a 24-hour study space, an innovation laboratory, a health and wellness center, additional Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) classrooms, expanded mental health peer counseling for Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the expansion of the A.S. Food Bank, a campus pub and infrastructure upgrades for the UCen.</p>\n<p>“When we think of facilities such as the [Student Resource Building], or the [Recreation Center], facilities financed primarily by student investment dollars, it was students 10, 20, 30 years ago who decided to make this happen for us today, for us to have access to those resources,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The project needs 50 percent + 1 “yes” votes for it to be implemented.</p>\n<p>If students vote in favor of the project, a $21.42 quarterly fee will be added to student fees until Fall 2022. Between fall 2022 and fall 2052, an additional $99.61 a quarter will be added to the fees, though that cost will progressively increase each year to match inflation.</p>\n<p>If passed, construction on the project will be completed by fall 2022. Additional fees will continue until 2052, according to the petition.</p>\n<p>Officials initially stated that the renovation would cost $48 million, but students would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">pay more</a> to fund the project.</p>\n<p>“I think this is something that each student will have to weigh themselves and see whether or not this is needed for our campus,” Le said. “But I myself am very supportive, and I’m supportive of the right for student autonomy to decide for themselves whether this should proceed or not.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Lu spent much of his time volunteering, including through beach clean-ups and music lessons in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An avid musician, Lu played the french horn in the Woodbridge High School marching band in Irvine, California. Lu also liked to play piano, baseball and work out with friends, often motivating them to exercise harder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Sanjongio became friends with Lu when the two played the french horn in their middle and high school band. Friends would often call Lu the “ride guy” because he was always willing to give someone a ride in his car if they needed to go somewhere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanjongio described Lu as “iconic” and well-liked, reflecting on when Lu was crowned king of the Winter Formal and the multiple times Lu would fall asleep in class in high school.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She says that Lu’s death has brought many of their high school friends together in a way only Lu could.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though it’s really horrible, it’s still like this new sense of connection and strength among all the people that he touched in his life, which is really amazing,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends from high school, including Sanjongio, also attended UCSB. Nathan Ng, a high school and college friend, echoed Sanjongio’s sentiments about Lu, adding that Lu approached everyone with a kindness and humility that is hard to find.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He went out of his way to help people, whether it was people in his normal social group or just people in general. He was very open to seeing how everyone was doing and I greatly respect that,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a present and constant part of his friends’ lives, said Eric Kim, a longtime friend of Lu’s and one of his roommates in Santa Cruz Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve known him for a long time, [and] I always expect his presence,” Kim said. “I’ve gotten used to him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was also enjoying his time at UCSB, Kim said, adding that Lu was excited to attend the university last summer.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It exceeded expectations when he got here, he was really having a good time, even when he had a lot of work or classes,” Kim said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malcolm Tsay met Lu in middle school and said Lu was “like a brother” to him.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was just the most helpful person ever,” Tsay said. “He always put other people first. You could talk to him about anything [and] he opened up his heart to everyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tsay set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/7u33cn-james-lus-funeral-fund\">GoFundMe</a> for Lu’s funeral and has raised over $13,000 so far. He said he wanted to give something back to Lu and help out his family.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a leader, Tsay said, and someone he could look to for guidance, whether it be for music or life advice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, I’m drum major of the marching band, and I wouldn’t have those leadership skills without the interactions I’ve shared with James and the advice he’s given me throughout the years,” Tsay said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another band friend, Aziz Hamza, said he continued to stay in contact with Lu at UCSB to see how he was adjusting to college life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamza described Lu as dedicated and having a “relaxed presence.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’d always be laughing, like, whatever conversation he would be having, it would be something humorous,” Hamza said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends noted that Lu was on his way to teach piano to children on the day he died. They said it was a testament to Lu’s selflessness and generosity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That just sums up his intentions in life. He wanted to help people he wanted to make a difference in the world,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“‘Till the very end, he was helping others and using his ability and helping teach other people,” Kim added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ng said he wants Lu to be remembered as someone who always encouraged others to try their best and put their needs before his own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He opened my eyes to being optimistic in this world and doing your best,” Ng said. “Going through this grief of losing him, I’m getting stronger everyday, and I always feel like he’s still watching me. He’s the kind of person you should want to model yourself after.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu’s funeral will be held at Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona Del Mar on Sunday, March 18, at 2 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

the American Mock Trial Association National Championships for the first time in the team’s 20-year history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team placed second behind Stanford University in the Los Angeles division of the Opening Round Championship Series (O.R.C.S.), which determined their eligibility for Nationals, which will take place from April 20 to 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only 48 of the 714 teams that participated in O.R.C.S. earned bids to attend Nationals, according to Vice President Marlon Steven Poroj.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the biggest accomplishment any team could achieve because of the high caliber of the Southern California area,” UCSB Mock Trial President and A team Captain Alexandria Suebert said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We compete against teams who have consistently placed highly at nationals and are highly concentrated within our area therefore to get a spot and be the second ranked team behind Stanford is phenomenal,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A team, which consists of Suebert, Co-Captain Blake Berich, Sudeep Dhanoa, Taylar Hender, Justine Jung, Jimmy McFeely, Marlon Steven Poroj, Kane Tenorio and Deborah Williams, is one of 48 teams that will travel to Minneapolis to compete in the National Championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s B team did not receive a bid for Nationals. However, they have surpassed their previous records, as this is the first year that both teams have qualified for O.R.C.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that we were able to qualify and be put on the same playing field as our A team and qualify alongside schools that don’t take us seriously really means a lot to me, coming in as an underdog,” B Captain and Secretary Zenia Safadi said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team is student-run and receives part-time assistance from a UCSB alum who acts as an attorney coach, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to Poroj.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That fact has been disadvantageous due to the huge time commitments, no attorney coaches, high tournament fees, and travel expenses,” Poroj said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this is the team’s biggest accomplishment to date, they have been steadily increasing their status as a nationally known team. In 2014, the team took first place in the Yale University Invitational, and this past January they hosted Mocktopia, the second-largest tournament on the West Coast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suebert praised her teammates for their motivation and persistence, a combination of which gives them “the Umph,” as the Executive Board calls it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though they are not sure of what to expect from their first-ever tournament, during which they will compete against teams from Harvard, Yale, Stanford and other Ivy League schools, Poroj believes that this is a defining moment in the team’s transformation as a team in it for fun, but also one that will “kick ass and take names.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we have never made it to Nationals before, we do not know what to expect, but we do know that only the best of the best will be competing … so we are going to Minneapolis with guns blazing,” Treasurer Janice Espindola said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has started a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/ucsb-mock-trial-nationals\">GoFundMe</a> to help pay for the trip to Nationals. </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the team did not have a coach.

would be built to fit Camacho’s needs. The cost of converting a vehicle into a food truck ranges from $95,000 to $120,000. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho has been selling raspados, mangonadas and other treats in Isla Vista and UCSB for the past three years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the campaign’s creation in February, $490 out of the $85,000 goal has been raised. The $85,000 primary goal is to cover the cost of a “professional” food cart as well as permits and insurance Camacho needs to sell on campus, according to the campaign’s </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/HijinoEloteroman\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M.U.J.E.R. co-chair and third-year sociology major Dulce Gonzalez</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created the campaign in hopes of gathering financial and community support for Camacho’s return to campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign was first posted on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale page on Facebook, and organizers have been tagging larger news outlets like Univision and Mitù in hopes to gain support beyond the UCSB community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve tried to collaborate with him because he’s not only trying to get back on campus to fundraise and help student orgs out with their fundraising, but we also want to try to expand his business,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho hopes to raise enough funds to help him purchase a food truck from a vendor in Los Angeles that would be built to fit Camacho’s needs. The cost of converting a vehicle into a food truck ranges from $95,000 to $120,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Sep. 2017, the Office of Student Life and the office for Environmental Health and Safety have implemented regulations that require vendors like Camacho to obtain either a Temporary Food Service permit, which has a fee of approximately $180, or a Mobile Food Facility permit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A general liability insurance that covers up to approximately $2 million in coverage is also required. The yearly payment for general liability insurance for a food cart vendor can range from $500 to $1000 a year, according to Brashears Insurance. For a food truck, the yearly payment can cost between $5,000 to $7,500 a year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho has since held fundraisers in Isla Vista but has experienced issues with the county food inspectors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has been asked to remove his stand by inspectors due to the proximity of a public restroom from his food booth, although he does have the necessary permits to sell in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He believes that a food truck would allow him to comfortably sell both on campus and in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unos de mi mayores gustos es trabajar con los estudiantes. Yo tengo que hacer todo posible para volver a trabajar con ellos y para que la universidad me dé el permiso para trabajar con ellos.”</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my greatest joys is working with the students. I have to do everything that is possible so that I can work with them and that the university give me permission to work with them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Camacho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho has cancelled all fundraising events at UCSB and expects to have the food truck by the beginning of the next school year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even that if we don’t meet the goal of the GoFundMe, what’s important is bringing awareness to the fact that someone who has contributed so much,” Arroyo said. “Someone

id=\"caption-attachment-82091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Coalition for a Better UC presented to A.S. their campaign to extend Cal Grant aid to summer sessions, claiming it is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school. <em>Will Tran /Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition for a Better UC launched a campaign in the fall of 2017 focused on passing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assembly Bill 3153</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which will extend financial aid from Cal Grant into summer sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign is expected to end in June of 2018 when the State Assembly will vote on the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coalition is requesting that the funding for this aid increase come from Governor Jerry Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s fund, which will amount to  $13.5 billion by the summer of 2019 avoids raising taxes for the extended aid, according to Eddy Chikukwa the president and founder of the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California’s Office of the President (UCOP) estimated the total cost of summer tuition for all the UCs, Cal States and community colleges would be $148 million a year, which is 1 percent of Brown’s Rainy Day Fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa, a third-year political science and philosophy double major, said he was inspired to start this campaign when he began working for the UC Santa Barbara Office of Financial Aid earlier last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Directors for the Cal State campuses are meeting in April to discuss and potentially approve the Bill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The board] saying they’ll legitimize it, means 23 Cal States and the 450,000 students they represent said they’re [in support of] this. It’s a really big deal for negotiating leverage with legislators,” Chikukwa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chikukwa, the coalition organizers alongside the University of California Student Association (UCSA) and the UC Regents will be going to Sacramento from March 24 to March 26 to present the bill to state legislators and ask for support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students (A.S.) passed a resolution on March 7 supporting this campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was presented by Mayela Morales, legislative outreach director for the Coalition, and Justice Dumlao, a third-year global studies major and communication director for the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine’s A.S. passed their own resolution on Feb. 15 sponsoring the Coalition’s campaign, and UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC Merced are among others that are discussing their involvement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most telling signs that someone is going to graduate [in four years] is income level,” Director of Student Outreach for the Coalition, Chadwyck Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a study done by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) in 2015, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California will see a decrease of 1.1 million college graduates by 2030 due to lack of financial aid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa and the rest of the Coalition began promoting the idea of extending the Cal Grant into summer sessions in order to increase the amount of students that graduate out of UC’s and Cal States within four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Coalition’s] whole motive was to educate people first, and then build legislative support,” said Chikukwa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the bill more appealing to legislators, the Coalition is asking students to sign a petition in support of it, according to Moore,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to show [the legislators] that students are behind this and are watching every step of the way,” Chikukwa said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Grant is expected to include undocumented students as well as offer more financial aid to students from middle income families, added Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition’s platform that was presented to the A.S. claims that the campaign is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school and to “ultimately create free higher education institutions</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We students need to take this matter into our own hands. Taking out loans.. only increases the over $1.3 trillion of student debt nationwide,” said Morales, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth-year global and chicanx studies double major</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I’m very optimistic that this bill will be approved.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article inaccurately reported that the funding will be officially coming from Governor Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund,” and has been corrected to show that the Coalition for a Better UC is recommending it come from Brown’s Fund</em>.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-76374\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Board of Regents approved a 3.5 percent tuition increase for out-of-state undergraduate students Thursday afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents voted 12-3 in favor of the tuition hike, which will add approximately $978 to yearly tuition costs for out-of-state students. The increase will go into effect at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year and is expected to raise $35 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano released a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-board-regents-chair-george-kieffer-and-uc-president-janet-napolitano-gov\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January expressing concerns about receiving less funding than expected from Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget plan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s budget proposal this year proposed only a 3 percent increase in funding allocated to the UC, down from 4 percent in years past. The state government typically increases UC funding to meet the ever-increasing number of enrolled students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been tabling and performing outreach to out of state students on our campus, and we’ve still yet to find anyone with 1,000 extra dollars floating around for next year’s tuition,” Spencer Brandt, UCSB Lobby Corps co-chair, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC admits meeting after meeting that a tuition hike is a band aid solution to a long term problem, caused by 20+ years of gubernatorial and state legislative divestment,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite receiving less state funding than expected, Napolitano said the university is committed to adding an additional 2,000 undergraduate students and 500 graduate students for the fall of 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many people who control the higher education committees in the Assembly and the Senate use their platform to score political points against the UC, and President Napolitano,” Brandt said. “Then when we take students to the Capitol to meet with them, they point the finger at the UC. And that’s worked for them for a long time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lobby Corps has a message for those legislators: UCSB students are not stupid,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristin Hsu, the external vice president of statewide affairs, has helped Lobby Corps prepare postcards asking students to “Fund the UC.” The postcards detail students’ demands and concerns and will be delivered to the state legislature at a conference next month, Hsu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What are the UC Regents expecting out of state students to sacrifice to pay for this tuition increase? The answer is physical and mental health, academic success, food and housing security,” Hsu said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, UC students are forced to pay for conflicts and disagreements among UCOP, the UC Regents, and the state legislature that we have no control over. That is an absolute shame,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will vote on an additional 2.7 percent tuition increase for in-state residents in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lobby Corps Internal Director Mayela Morales and other UCSB students attended the public forum of Wednesday’s Regents meeting to protest the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might’ve lost with out-of-state students this time, but we also have the proposed in-state tuition increase coming up in the May Regents meeting,” Morales said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morales said that she plans to lobby representatives in Sacramento to “allocate the sufficient funding to the UC system in order to buy out the tuition hikes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an issue that needs to be targeted through various tactics, but we have to remember that if it has been stopped before, we can do it again,” she added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Community Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anisq’Oyo’ Park, Children’s Park and Estero Park are among other proposed locations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould explained that electrical boxes have already been installed in the ground at People’s Park by Embarcadero Hall and I.V. Clinic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underground trenches to power two electrical panels have also been constructed that run from two cement access points in the ground.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gould, the electrical panels are scheduled to be installed in April and will allow bands to come and perform at People’s Park without needing to bring in a generator for power.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The electrical lines installed will also help bring light to Perfect Park, which is located next to People’s Park, Gould added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding for these new improvements will be coming from Measure O that was on the ballot last May for I.V. voters for the 2017 Santa Barbara County Elections. Lebell said the measure was a response to the expiration of a “consolidated bond” established in 1999 that taxed each bedroom in I.V. an extra $28 a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the bond was paid off, instead of allowing this tax to expire, the IVRPD held a special election in June of 2017 that proposed keeping the tax at the same rate for an additional 10 years, but this time to have the money go toward park improvements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure O gives the IVRPD about $250,000 a year to apply towards park enhancements, Lebell said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD is also hoping to install new lighting on the basketball courts at Estero Park, located off of Camino Del Sur. This would “allow community members to play after sunset,” IVRDP Chairman Jacob Lebell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell said the new lighting proposals are “a response to the community’s desire for improvements.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the years, improved lighting has consistently ranked among Isla Vistan’s infrastructural issues that they would most like to see addressed and improved,” Lebell said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this time, no concrete decisions have been made for expanding lighting, other than what has already been installed in People’s Park.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82051\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1147266140\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82049\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82051\" data-attachment-id=\"82051\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-14/new-light-fixtures-to-be-installed-in-i-v-parks/childrens-park-shade-by-vivian-bui-online-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-82051\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Childrens-Park-SHADE-by-Vivian-Bui-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82051\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Children’s park is one of the proposed locations for new lighting installations. <em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pegeen Soutar, an IVRPD board member and I.V. resident, said that adding new lights along the pathway that runs through Anisq’Oyo’ Park will make the area more inviting for people to walk through at night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVRPD board member and I.V. resident Matias Eusterbrock suggested turning the new light fixtures into a community project by inviting I.V. residents to come and paint the light poles different colors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gould expressed the necessity of implementing lights that point down in an attempt to reduce the amount of light pollution at night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell added that the IVRPD’s goal is to make the parks in I.V. feel “more visible, more inviting and safer.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Le has also been filmed gathering signatures from students at an Isla Vista party.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Justice Dumlao said he was sent a video over the weekend that showed Le at an I.V. party, gathering signatures for the petition.</p>\n<p>“I have a video of a Snapchat that someone took that said something along the lines of ‘president always working.’ It’s a video of the petition, and it pans up to Hieu giving a thumbs up at what looks like an indoor party with loud music,” Dumlao said.</p>\n<p>Le denied educating students about the petition and gathering signatures while he himself was intoxicated.</p>\n<p>He denied attending I.V. parties to discuss the petition and “doesn’t recall” whether the video itself was taken at an I.V. party.</p>\n<p>“Our strategy process is to ensure that one, we talk to students in a way that is transparent and educate them and let them decide whether they want to sign the petition form or not,” he said when asked whether he had approached intoxicated students to ask for signatures.</p>\n<p>The video can be viewed below.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 480px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-81848-1\" width=\"480\" height=\"848\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hieu-le-video.mp4?_=1\"></source><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hieu-le-video.mp4\">http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hieu-le-video.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Video courtesy of Justice Dumlao</em></p>\n<p>The renovation would “address some of the longest standing needs of our student body” by adding 24-hour study spaces, classrooms for Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) and would expand the A.S.

The other week we reported that 2,100 used the food bank on the three days it was open,” he said.</p>\n<p>During the week of Feb. 26, Le set up his petition in the Food Bank and students mistakenly signed it, thinking it was a sign-in sheet, according to the Food Bank Committee’s minutes from a March 2 meeting.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81874\" style=\"width: 753px\" class=\"wp-caption

id=\"caption-attachment-81874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“We’ve actually crossed off all the names of the students who mistakenly signed onto that petition, mistaking it for the food bank sign-in sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” Le said. <em>Photo submitted anonymously</em></p></div>\n<p>“The petition misled since it was stating that it was mainly meant for the expansion of the Food Bank without clearly stating of the expansion of the UCen by increasing student fees,” advisor Rodolfo Ortiz said at the Food Bank Committee’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“The petition was put next to the sign-in sheet which caused students to mistake between the forms,” Vice Chair Tabitha Yuen said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>The minutes reference the petition as having been “set-up by Hieu Le at the Food Bank lounge last week.”</p>\n<p>Le, however, did not respond when asked if he had set up the petition in the food bank himself.</p>\n<p>Le acknowledged that the petition had been placed “next to the sign-in sheet for the actual food bank.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve actually crossed off all the names of the students who mistakenly signed onto that petition, mistaking it for the food bank sign-in sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” he said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to “disapprove” the UCen expansion petition in the food bank during the March 2 meeting, meaning they will no longer allow the petition to be placed within the bank, according to first-year history major James Ferraro.</p>\n<p>“The ballot language is long and extensive … What I would argue is that people aren’t going to look through it in depth, people are going to vote for things and not see it, and so people are going to pass a fee raise,” Ferraro said.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of student fees, the university itself and an alumni donation fund, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’ve raised about $2.5 million on campus equities, not donors yet,” Le said. “There is an anticipation that we’re gonna raise quite a good amount, but we don’t have a certain figure in mind yet.”</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse and Dumlao both said Le and his fellow students have not been open regarding fees when approaching students about the petition.</p>\n<p>“Not only have I witnessed [this], but constituents have told me that they’re not being told the fact that their student fees are going to be increased,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>“The issue is, even if we get donors and we assume that they’re going to give us $10 million, there’s still a budget that needs to be covered that would be from the student expense,” she added.</p>\n<p>Dumlao explained the project is being publicized as expanding the food bank and improving the UCen rather than focusing on the fact that student fees will rise.</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard from multiple people, both people who have been asked to sign the petition and … people who Hieu has been soliciting to work with him, that they have been told not to say or explicitly mention right off the bat that student fees will be raised if you sign that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Le denied not fully explaining the petition to students.</p>\n<p>“The cost is reflected in the petition, and our process is to hold the highest standards of integrity,” Le said. “Students at this university are very smart, and they know what they’re signing and they know what the idea is. Our job is to educate them on the process.”</p>\n<p>According to the petition, the UCen is now more than 50 years old, was designed to accommodate 17,000 students and was last updated in 1994. Currently, UCSB has more than 25,000 students and 6,800 faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>It is projected that 28,000 students will be enrolled by 2025, the petition says.</p>\n<p>“These facilities can no longer support the needs of our growing community, nor are they designed to keep up with the ever-changing and increasing technological demands of the current generation,” the petition reads.</p>\n<p>The project was first proposed six years ago, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“All three sponsors, A.S., the Division of Student Affairs and the University Center worked and consulted with students, clubs and organizations,” Le said. “The Office of Budget &amp; Planning was the one who drafted the [current] proposal.”</p>\n<p>If the petition is placed on the ballot and students vote in favor of it, student fees will increase $21.42 per quarter during Fall Quarter 2018. The increase will remain an additional $21.42 per quarter until Fall Quarter 2022, at which point it will increase to a “maximum” of $99.61 per quarter, including summer, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’re addressing an overcrowded campus; students are competing against each other for spots, spots inside the classroom; people are sitting in the aisles; students are waiting two weeks to see a psychological or academic counselor,” Le said.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, what we’re looking at is that students are competing against each other for spots, rather than we’re not addressing the issue in terms of providing access, and fair access, to each and every single one of our campus community [members],” he added.</p>\n<p>The petition needs 3,116 signatures to be placed on the ballot for students to vote on during Spring Quarter, according to Le. The deadline to get these signatures is March 16 and as of Wednesday night, the petition has approximately 2,000 signatures.</p>\n<p><em>Shomik Mukherjee contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Gessesse said “constituents,” not “kids.”</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio. <em>Tamari Dzotsenidze/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The student-run radio station struggled to match previous fund drives which raised $35,000 in 2017 and $29,000 the year before.</p>\n<p>Miles Bishop, KCSB general manager, explained that last year’s Thomas Fire impacted the station’s ability to advertise for the event and win over donors.</p>\n<p>“[The fires] really put us out of commission for the whole of December,” he explained.</p>\n<p>In previous years, the fund drive’s planning started in November and had about three-and-a-half months for setting up and advertising. This year, that time was cut down by a month.</p>\n<p>Besides preparation issues, Bishop said that conflicting fundraising relief aid for the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides was another factor in the drop in donations.</p>\n<p>Although he hadn’t cross-checked KCSB’s donor list, he guessed that the previous contributors were providing more towards relief efforts.</p>\n<p>“Some people weren’t really comfortable donating to us when there’s other causes for direct relief,” he said.</p>\n<p>The radio station’s event faced another roadblock with the adoption of a last-minute advertising pitch to contribute 10 percent of every $1,000 dollars collected by KCSB to the Direct Relief organization assisting in aid for areas affected by the fires and Montecito mudslides.</p>\n<p>This pledge required KCSB to tiptoe over university warnings and get an official invoice from Direct Relief in order to fulfill that promise.</p>\n<p>According to Bishop, “The university didn’t want us to act as agents of [Direct Relief]. We can’t say we’re ‘donating’ 10 percent. We have to say we’re contributing to them, but not on their behalf.”</p>\n<p>Despite conflict and delays, the radio station continued the fund drive that consisted of 24-hour radio shows that asked listeners to donate. They also offered listeners “thank you gifts” like vinyl records, concert tickets and others.</p>\n<p>KCSB also sponsored festival events in downtown Santa Barbara and hosted an open-mic night fundraiser in Goleta.</p>\n<p>After contributing 10 percent of every $1,000 raised to the Direct Relief organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges, Bishop is satisfied with everything he and his team put together.</p>\n<p>“In the grand scheme of things, 23k is pretty good and I’m really proud of everyone I’m working with, especially given the circumstances,” he said.</p>\n<p>While the official fundraiser has ended, online donations will still be collected until March 16, through PayPal and Network for Good.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of the story stated KCSB would donate “10 percent to the Direct Relief organization.” The station will donate 10 percent of every $1,000 raised. The story also stated Bishop referred to KCSB’s 2017 donor list and “contested” that the donors were now putting money toward relief efforts. Bishop said he hadn’t cross-checked the donors between this year and last and he only “guessed” that the donors were contributing money elsewhere.</em></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-81844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">To further enhance safety, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station near Del Playa Drive on April 7, the day of Deltopia. <em>McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lieutenant David Millard from UCPD said he anticipates about a 20 percent decrease in UCPD law enforcement, “depending on what the weekend is looking like.”</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Juan Camarena from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) added that the amount of IVFP officers will most likely be similar in numbers to last year; however, they do not plan to bring horses to the event.</p>\n<p>UCPD and IVFP plan to closely monitor social media to see if anything is posted about Deltopia weekend plans. What they see could determine the amount of law enforcement they deploy, according to Camarena.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) held a town hall to discuss police presence, parking restrictions, fencing, public concerns and the ideal Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Camarena and Millard also guaranteed that undocumented students will be safe from detainment due to immigration status, and they explained instances in which students will have to present identification to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“We come into contact with people that violate the law, we don’t care about their legal status,” Camarena said. “As long as they provide some type of ID that’s not fake.”</p>\n<p>To further enhance safety, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station near Del Playa Drive on April 7, the day of Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Students at the town hall also expressed concerns regarding the amount of fencing put up the weekend of Deltopia, especially the fencing along El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>Jacob Lebell, an Isla Vista resident, said the fences were “insulting,” “unnecessary” and “intolerable.”</p>\n<p>In response to these complaints, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to direct staff to request that no fencing be installed on El Colegio Road during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Camarena revealed that barricades will be placed on Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road during the weekend and said any cars that leave that area during the weekend will not be allowed to re-enter due to concerns of cars being vandalized.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and the Isla Vista Tenants Union will be advertising for students not to park in those areas by going door-to-door, according to EVPLA Batsheva Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>If cars are parked on Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road, they will not be towed, Camarena said.</p>\n<p>The CSD unanimously passed a third motion to direct staff to find alternative parking for residents. Director Spencer Brandt suggested that the parking lot of the Community Center be used as alternative parking for residents during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>A noise ordinance in Isla Vista will be in effect from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. throughout the weekend of Deltopia, according to Gina Fischer, representative for Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>The CSD released an online survey to ask UCSB students about their plans for Deltopia and their opinions on police presence.</p>\n<p>Results from 335 responses revealed that the majority of students were unsatisfied with law enforcement presence during Deltopia last year; however, most students still said they felt safe throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>The survey also revealed that 64 percent of responders discourage their friends from visiting I.V. during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>The CSD emphasized that in order for an ideal Deltopia to become a reality, there must be a balance between the students’ desires and the community’s desires in regard to police presence.</p>\n<p>Last year, the university spent an estimated <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">$30,000 to $40,000</a> on advertisements urging visitors to stay away from Isla Vista during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>This year, the university expects to spend less on Deltopia ads — specifically, in the $20,000–$30,000 range, according to Andrea Estrada, UCSB director of news and media relations. A final figure will not be determined until after Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Even with outside donations, the amount students would pay in fees still far exceeds the $48 million total that officials have mentioned.</p>\n<p>If the bill were passed, only part of the student fees would go toward renovating and maintaining the UCen. A much larger portion would go toward paying off loans that the university would take out to finish the job in just four years. The university would need 30 more years to pay off those loans, plus interest.</p>\n<p>The fees would also include administrative costs, which would go to A.S., UCSB administration and financial aid distribution.</p>\n<p>The “NewCen” project, which Le first introduced in late January, would bring the UCen a 24-hour study space, a project laboratory, expanded office space for campus organizations and a central pub.</p>\n<p>Le contends that the time is ripe to “revitalize” the facilities because the UCen was last renovated back in 1994, when UCSB held 8,000 fewer students.</p>\n<p>“The revitalized complex is envisioned as the heart of campus by the UCSB lagoon where students can congregate, eat, socialize, study, work, debate and collaborate,” the petition reads.</p>\n<p>If Le can secure 3,116 valid signatures by March 16 and the UC Office of the President gives approval, the NewCen will be placed on the Associated Students elections ballot this April. Then, students could vote to pass the fee by a threshold of 50 percent plus one voter. The fee would take effect in the 2018-19 school year.</p>\n<p>If passed, the renovation would require a $21.42 quarterly student fee until 2022, after which students would pay a $99.61 quarterly fee through 2052.</p>\n<p>The earlier, $21.42 fee is for students who would never see the results of a UCen renovation. Over the following 30 years, UCSB students would continue paying for the renovated building, which would be finished by 2022.</p>\n<p>At Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Le said that it is still “entirely uncertain” if student fees will be needed to pay for the project at all. He mentioned that he may have a “unique opportunity” to work with “big donors” who could offset the total cost of the project.</p>\n<p>First-year history major James Ferraro, who has followed the project’s early development, also estimated a $190 million cost for the project when he spoke at the Senate public forum.</p>\n<p>While the UCSB Office of Development could contribute to the funding, there is a cap to the amount the office could give, Ferraro told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>In the “best-case scenario,” the office would put $35 million toward funding the renovation, Ferraro said, citing Le’s own estimation at a recent organization meeting. Realistically, the office may contribute between $15 and $35 million.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/","id":2302,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[2301,2300,2299],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":63,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
