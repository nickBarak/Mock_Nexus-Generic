Brown Act of 1953 “guarantees the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies,” according to a pamphlet published by the California Attorney General’s Office in 2003.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The act requires that all boards, commissions and councils publicly detail the items they plan to discuss in closed session before closing the meeting to the public. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closed meetings are those in which the public and executives are excluded,  Safadi said.</span></p>\n<p>Safadi explained the Brown Act applies to the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate because of academic senate clause.</p>\n<p>“In 66 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 252 (1983), it is concluded that the meetings of an academic senate of [colleges] are subject to the open meeting requirements of the Brown Act,” Safadi said to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“[Academic senate is] a blanket statement that covers all forms of legislation in universities… that is what I understood it to say,” she added. “Furthermore, the Brown Act is directly referred to in the [A.S.] legal code and thus associated students has subjected itself to its bylaws.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week’s closed session was unusual in that Senate asked A.S. Internal Vice President (IVP) Steven Ho and A.S. Executive Director </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marisela Márquez </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to leave as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As an individual who was explicitly stated to not be a part of the closed session, I also cannot comment on what was discussed since I was not permitted to be present,” Ho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Rafael Cornejo first motioned to go into a closed meeting to </span>“to discuss internals,” according to meeting minutes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cornejo rescinded his initial motion but made a second motion around 7:30 p.m., this time specifying that the meeting would discuss “internals of A.S. and increasing accountability with senators and proxies only.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi sent out an email to all A.S. executives, senators and advisors on Nov. 2, warning senators that they “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must adhere to the Brown Act in its fullest capacity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Violations [of the Brown Act] may result in external litigation and repercussions,” Safadi said in the email obtained by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The attorney general simply informed senators on how to go about closed sessions,” Ho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate must include both intent to have a closed meeting and a description of the content of the closed meeting that is descriptive enough to provide the public with a semblance of the topic, according to Safadi’s email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they take any action during the meeting, the Senate would be required to disclose those votes or actions to the public within 24 hours. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate is only allowed to go into closed session to discuss personnel, public security, pending litigation, labor negotiations and real property negotiations, according to the Brown Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi highlighted personnel and pending litigation in her email as the two reasons more relevant as to why Senate would hold a closed session.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [Nov. 8]: This article’s title was updated to “A.S.

id=\"caption-attachment-84758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Biko Garage held a voting information night on Monday. <em>Laila Voss / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The infonight focused specifically on the statewide ballot propositions. Event organizers provided students with the overview, background, pros, cons and endorsements of Proposition 1 through Proposition 12, excluding Proposition 9.</p>\n<p>Proposition 9 was<a href=\"https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/prop-9-supreme-court-ruling.pdf\"> removed from the ballot</a> in July by the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Rain Kahsu, organizer of the Biko Voting Infonight and fourth-year political science student, said she wanted to hold this event after speaking to her housemates about the election and realizing that “we were all freaking out.”</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to have an event where I could be with members of the community and my friends and just talk about this kind of stuff that’s kind of scary. There’s so much information,” Kahsu said.</p>\n<p>Approximately 20 people attended and discussed each proposition, asking questions about the issues, providing clarifications and offering personal opinions.</p>\n<p>For example, one of the propositions discussed was Proposition 8, which would limit the amount of money kidney dialysis clinics could charge for treatment.</p>\n<p>As with the other propositions, organizers went over the pros and cons, stating that clinics would be prevented from treating patients differently based on what type of insurance they have, so the proposition could result in the closure of “many” California dialysis clinics.</p>\n<p>Many attendees had their phones out throughout the event, googling specific proposition language and facts to aid the conversation.</p>\n<p>At one point, an attendee frustrated with the complex and vague language of the propositions exclaimed, “Why is it so difficult to fucking vote?”</p>\n<p>While the remark was met with laughs, the sentiment was echoed by several students at the event.</p>\n<p>Kahsu hoped students attending the event would come and “gain information they didn’t know and be able to ask questions” and “be able to talk about how they’re going to vote or things they’ve heard.”</p>\n<p>For fourth-year global studies major Naima Sudjian-Carlisle, Monday’s event was an opportunity to be involved with a community event where students could learn from each other.</p>\n<p>“I procrastinated in researching what’s on the ballot, what people to vote for and everything like that,” Sudjian-Carlisle said. “I was really glad to hear different perspectives on propositions. I’m now informed for voting tomorrow, but I still want to do some research tonight.”</p>\n<p>Other attendees agreed that it was helpful to get together with community members to talk about the ballot before voting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“The proposition language can be really confusing, so it’s helpful to just be in a group with other people and go through them to kind of pick them apart to see what is actually the intention of each proposition,” said Solmaz Soleimani, a UCSB Class of 2018 graduate.</p>\n<p>Kat Ghodoosian, a third-year political science student, emphasized the importance of being an informed voter. She said the event helped her “get more of a nuanced perspective.”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s one thing to go out and register and vote, but it’s another thing to be an informed voter,” Ghodoosian said. “UCSB students should feel responsible not only to be registered and to go out to the polls, but they should also be responsible for knowing what’s on the ballot.”</p>\n<p>Attendees left the event around 6:30 p.m., with several promising to post their further research on the propositions on the Biko Garage Facebook page before the election the next day.</p>\n<p>Kahsu was optimistic about how the info night had gone, stating she hoped attendees were able to walk away “a little more informed and a little less anxious.”</p>\n<p>“Vote and, even more than that, try to be more engaged in politics and with your community,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>The 2018 midterm elections are on Tuesday, Nov. 6.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The two organizations have spent the past few months preparing for the midterm election.<em> Courtesy of College Republicans, Campus Democrats respective Facebook pages</em></p></div>\n<p>The two organizations took different approaches in preparing for the Nov. 6 election. Campus Democrats focused on registering voters and getting out the vote, while College Republicans created spaces for discussion and informed students of the issues.</p>\n<p>Both groups have been actively canvassing for their respective endorsed candidates.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats has devoted efforts to register voters, according to Campus Democrats President Aisha Khan.</p>\n<p>“Preparing for midterms is [about] maintaining that focus we’ve had since our beginning to educate young people about politics, politics locally, how they can get involved and why it’s important,” Khan, a third-year political science major, said.</p>\n<p>Since January 2018, Khan said Campus Democrats has registered 9,513 voters in the Isla Vista and UCSB communities.</p>\n<p>This includes the concentrated registration efforts during UCSB’s winter and spring quarters for the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\">Measure R campaign</a>.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats members tabled in the Arbor and the University Center almost every day from the beginning of the 2018-19 school year to register voters, Khan said.</p>\n<p>They also had stations around campus and I.V. on Oct. 22, the last day to register.</p>\n<p>College Republicans does not focus on registering voters and instead focuses on providing an open forum for discussion to students about the issues and candidates, according to College Republicans President Leslie Garcia.</p>\n<p>“In the past, we’ve hosted events for people to watch the presidential debates and the Republican candidate debates,” Garcia, a fourth-year Middle East studies and political science double major, said.</p>\n<p>“I think that the purpose of our [organization] is to create a space for discourse which isn’t really found on campus.”</p>\n<p>In addition to open general meetings, College Republicans hold public forum events throughout the year, such as the event held in the Hub on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>The organization also holds speaking events and often dedicates large portions of time during those events for debate and questions.</p>\n<p>“Becoming engaged in a space where you are capable and there is an opportunity for you to debate your positions, that really does tend to [make] people [want] to be more knowledgeable and more involved in the political sphere,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>In addition to creating spaces for students to discuss and learn more about politics, both organizations have been canvassing for candidates aligned with their respective views.</p>\n<p>“One way that we have remained involved in the [upcoming] midterm elections is canvassing for Justin Fareed,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>Fareed is a Republican Congressional candidate in the 24th congressional district. The district is currently represented by Salud Carbajal, who is endorsed by the Campus Democrats.</p>\n<p>The organization has been knocking on doors and speaking to voters in Goleta and Santa Maria leading up to the election.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also gotten involved with the No On Prop 10 campaign, so we’ve been making phone calls for them about two or three times a week, about five of our members each time,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>California Proposition 10 would repeal the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1506\">Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act</a>, a state law enacted in 1995 that places limitations on the power of city governments to control rent.</p>\n<p>Now that voter registration has ended, Campus Democrats has also doubled down on campaigning for local candidates and issues.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats “has been a volunteer for local Democratic campaigns” since its inception. The organization also has close ties with the campaigns of incumbent congressman Salud Carbajal and incumbent assemblywoman Monique Limón, according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“It’s about emphasizing the importance of local politics and the power that we have here locally,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>The organization has been canvassing for its slate of endorsed candidates as well as the passing of Measure G and California Proposition 10 by calling voters and going door-to-door in Santa Barbara, Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“People get exposure to what it’s like [to work on] on a real political campaign,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Khan and Garcia both emphasized the importance of students exercising their right to vote.</p>\n<p>Garcia highlighted the importance of educated and informed voting as a key mission of College Republicans.</p>\n<p>She noted the influence of the political climate on conversations about the election with community members.</p>\n<p>“I think the majority of students are left-leaning, but I don’t think they’re so left-leaning that they’re completely shut down to discourse,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>“In the past year or two, there have been a lot of situations on campuses where events are shut down and students are harassed or assaulted because they are putting their political opinions out there. I don’t think that’s a thing that really happens here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>She said she believes elections such as the midterms can be overwhelming for first-time voters and individuals new to the U.S. political sphere.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats also keeps the age of its intended audience in mind, and the organization’s main goal is “to educate and empower young people about politics,” according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“For a lot of us, we are really new to politics so it’s a unique opportunity to have a very powerful voice and [change] something when you are brand new to it,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>“There are not that many places in the country where young people’s votes are concentrated in an area and Isla Vista is one of those places. It makes a really big difference locally.”</p>\n<p><em>The 2018 midterm elections are on Tuesday, Nov. 6.

separate position.</p>\n<p>Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, ran on a platform of lowering tuition, expanding sexual assault resources and advocating for students and workers with disabilities, according to Loudon’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>The board briefly considered halving the threshold, but decided against it after agreeing that “the pre-determined voter threshold is not modifiable while the election is already in place,” Renteria said in a statement sent out Sunday.</p>\n<p>“It is important to note that the Elections Board only rules on the Elections process. We cannot and do not make any considerations based on who the candidate(s) is/are, the qualifications of the candidate(s) or the position(s) that are vacant,” he added.</p>\n<p>The position was left vacant following the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualification</a> of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales during Spring Quarter.

I.V. area and just be in a space to be engaged with the community,” Jai Syal, Rockfire director of marketing and strategy, said.</p>\n<p>“Our burgers come on a fresh-baked flatbread bun, and that bun is baked in the oven after you order it. Our pizzas come on a fresh-baked flatbread as well, but if that’s not your kind of thing, we have wings, salads and other side orders.”</p>\n<p>Syal described Rockfire Grill’s foray into I.V. as “a funny story.”</p>\n<p>“[My younger brother] was living in the building next door, and he was walking to class one day and noticed the space was open for lease,” Syal said.</p>\n<p>“I was visiting him in his new apartment one day, and while I was here, I talked to the landlord, reviewed the lease, built a model and realized that this could be a great opportunity.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84740\" style=\"width: 1344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84740\" data-attachment-id=\"84740\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-04/rockfire-rocks-into-isla-vista/img_3089/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?fit=1334%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1334,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3089\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84740\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?w=1334&amp;ssl=1 1334w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rockfire serves burgers, pizzas and salads among other items. <em>Nyah Scott / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After the team finished working out the logistics and staffing, Rockfire Grill came to be.</p>\n<p>The location was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new-latest-additions-to-isla-vista/\">previously occupied</a> by Rincon Brewery, which closed down over the summer.</p>\n<p>“We have a stage inside for live music and open mic nights,” Syal said.</p>\n<p>“Our whole tagline is ‘Better Buns, Better Burgers.’ Once you feel it and try it for yourself, you’ll know it’s something that’s unique.”</p>\n<p>The restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday and 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The event was organized by Senator Solomon (left). <em>Courtesy of Zion Solomon</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB students, led by UCSB Associated Students Senator Zion Solomon, organized the “Trans Joy Take Over” to increase visibility within the trans community.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to bring a positive movement and show trans people that they are seen and visible and show people why it’s important to show solidarity with trans folks even if they aren’t trans themselves,” said Solomon, a second-year history of public policy major.</p>\n<p>The effort consisted of card- and poster-making activities on Monday and Tuesday in the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) room, located within the Student Resource Building (SRB).</p>\n<p>Students also tabled in the Arbor on Thursday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>\n<p>These events were supported with funds from the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and RCSGD, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>“I know that suicide rates for trans people are rising and it’s not good for the mental health of trans people to be seeing this in the media, so regardless of whether they’re home or here, people are affected by it,” they said.</p>\n<p>Several other volunteers joined Solomon in the Arbor.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Andres, a second-year sociology major, expressed that this event could be very informative and valuable to people without much knowledge of the transgender community.</p>\n<p>“I think having visibility, having trans flags and rainbow flags out here and all of our signs really can leave an impact on someone who might not know a lot about the trans or LGBTQ+ community,” Andres said.</p>\n<p>Diego Reyes, a second-year biology major who tabled on Thursday, is adamant about the drastic implications the Trump Administration’s policy might have.</p>\n<p>“I know there are a lot of people who have their own opinions on what being transgender means and about what being non-binary means,” Reyes said. “I feel like that passing gives them a pass to spread trans antagonism and trans hatred… And I think if that passes then it’s gonna come back probably a hundred times worse [than it already is].”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“It’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UCSB’s administration has “been pretty responsive to trans needs” but always has room to improve, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Their primary concern is how the environment created by students on campus for transgender people could potentially see a big change following the gender redefinition policy.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that this will affect this university’s response. Maybe the students’ response and maybe transphobic people at this university, but I think we should still be pushing the university to support trans students regardless of whatever the administration says,” Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Riley Hsieh, a second-year political science major, talked about the importance of support from allies who extend beyond just the queer and trans community.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important that we have allies in the community… because it’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n<p>Ivana Cruz spoke about how mistakes in pronoun use, whether deliberate or not, can feel invalidating and isolating, “especially in academic circles.”</p>\n<p>“Even if there’s a slip with a pronoun and they don’t take time to acknowledge that, it can really intimidate you from an already-intimidating process of reaching out to your professors.”</p>\n<p>However, Cruz stressed that solidarity can lead to progress and inclusivity and positive change.</p>\n<p>“I try to look at what’s possible. I look at the fact that 20 years ago we wouldn’t be having an event like this. We wouldn’t be having open conversations about pronouns without being laughed at. They, them would still be grammatically incorrect,” Cruz said.</p>\n<p>“I just think that we as a community have a responsibility to grow more and that’s essentially what’s going to lead to a very progressing change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-80145\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Thomas Fire caused poor air quality into Santa Barbara County. <em>Campbell Nolan / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“SCE believes its electrical equipment was associated with an ignition near Koenigstein Road in Santa Paula — one of at least two origin points for the Thomas Fire,” Southern California Edison (SCE) said in press release sent out on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>However, the statement noted that there were other factors that contributed to the Thomas Fire, including dry vegetation, high temperatures and strong winds.</p>\n<p>“Wildfire risk is increasing at the same time as more and more residential and commercial development is occurring in some of the highest-risk areas — with over a quarter of SCE’s service territory in high fire risk areas identified on the CPUC’s (California Public Utilities Commision) fire risk maps,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>SCE is now awaiting permission from the California Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) to further their investigation into the causes of the Thomas Fire.</p>\n<p>According to the press release, CAL FIRE has removed equipment located near Koenigstein Road, so SCE has not yet been able to inspect it. “SCE will not be able to determine the specific cause of the Koenigstein Road ignition until it can analyze the equipment currently in CAL FIRE’s possession.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, SCE is conducting an ongoing study regarding the causes of the Thomas Fire. This study takes an in-depth look into possible ignition points and fire progression from each point, among other factors.</p>\n<p>SCE is one of the largest electric utility companies in the U.S., serving about 15 million customers in Southern California, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire devastated the Santa Barbara area last December, burning over 281,893 acres of land. It was the largest fire in California history at the time, until it was surpassed by the Mendocino Complex Fire in July 2018.</p>\n<p>During the fire, UC Santa Barbara <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/uc-santa-barbara-gym-will-accept-nearly-200-evacuees-from-thomas-fire/\">opened</a> its recreation center to evacuees from the Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Associated Students Senate also <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-15/a-s-senate-allocates-5000-to-help-students-head-home-during-thomas-fire/\">allocated</a> over $2,000 to students who needed to return home because of the fire. UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\">cancelled finals week</a> for Fall Quarter 2018 due to the unsafe conditions on campus.</p>\n<p>The fire burned the soil, preventing it from being able to absorb the heavy rainfall that followed, thus leading to the Montecito mudslides which <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/\">killed</a> over 20 people in January and forced thousands to evacuate.</p>\n<p>The findings come as SCE faces multiple charges relating to the Thomas Fire, including from attorneys representing local residents and the City of Ventura.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

The board motioned to authorize the general manager to request funding from the university to cover the program.</p>\n<p>The finalization of the MOU encountered a minor hurdle during the meeting due to concerns about the contract phrasing which stipulated the investigator “be the primary point of contact for all such investigations occurring within the boundaries of the District.”</p>\n<p>A representative from the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) who was present during the meeting reported that the language in the MOU would create an interference with services and jurisdiction of the SBSO.</p>\n<p>“We just need to work through this to make sure we are not subverting the primary jurisdiction of the Sheriff and that we are not supplanting the services that are already provided by the Sheriff as it relates to these investigations,” he said.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) Director Brianna Conway countered their concerns, saying the inclusion of the term “primary point of contact” provided an essential element to the position of the investigator.</p>\n<p>“What that does is tell survivors that the first person they tell [their] story to is gonna be the person that stays with [their] case throughout the duration… and really provide that continuity in care in that response,” Conway said during the public comment period.</p>\n<p>Several I.V. CSD directors agreed with Conway’s suggestions, adding that these were consistent with the intended model of the program.</p>\n<p>However, UCPD would be in charge of implementation of such policy practices during the operalization of the investigator position, according to I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand.</p>\n<p>Several organizations have pushed for the implementation of an interpersonal violence investigator in I.V., including Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), C.A.R.E, UCPD and the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Members of SASA who were present at Tuesday’s meeting were glad to see the fulfillment of a program that was under discussion for over a year.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a long conversation… We’re very happy to see that the needs to the community and the need for the localization of the resource being finally represented in the MOU,” SASA President Emily Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand also expressed similar sentiments of both hope and happiness at the long-awaited implementation of an interpersonal violence survivor service in Isla Vista</p>\n<p>“This will be successful. This is really about serving our community, making it a safer place and us, Isla Vista’s local government, saying that we believe survivors, that we stand with survivors and that time’s up,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Right before making the official motion to finalize the contract, Bertrand recounted the I.V. CSD’s first meeting, in which an attendee shared her experience of being a survivor of sexual assault in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The most important comment that I heard that night was… about the experiences of so many survivors in this community and it’s those experiences that really make me happy that we’re taking this action here,” Bertrand said, tearing up during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“There’s too many people getting hurt in this community.

The stated goal of the forum was to foster “constructive and respectful debate,” according to UCSB College Republicans president Leslie Garcia.</p>\n<p>During the group discussion portion, participants broke into roughly six groups ranging from five to ten members.</p>\n<p>Discussion was guided by the following three questions, which were displayed on a screen at the front of the room:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do you believe that the right to due process has served the purpose envisioned by the authors of the Constitution?</li>\n<li>Does due process help to facilitate justice?</li>\n<li>Is the principle “innocent until proven guilty” the best way for organizing a legal system?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While the discussion questions focused on the legal implications of due process, participants also heavily discussed Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings and the national uproar left in the wake of his confirmation.</p>\n<p>Speakers then shifted the topic from due process in the legal system to due process in public life. Eleven participants volunteered to speak during the open mic and were given a maximum of two minutes each.</p>\n<p>California College Republicans co-chair Andrew Gates stressed the necessity of maintaining due process, even in the court of public opinion. He advocated for the reflection of constitutional values in American culture throughout the discussion.</p>\n<p>“Even though it is technically true that we don’t have to abide by the stringent standard of due process that a court of law has to abide by, in cases like Kavanaugh…we should live in the spirit of the constitutional principles,” he said.</p>\n<p>A minority of people disagreed with Gates, stating that due process should not apply outside of the legal system.</p>\n<p>Fourth year mathematics major Dylan Pizzo spoke about the infeasibility of applying due process in the real world.</p>\n<p>“Suppose you’re looking at prospective hires. An applicant…at their previous job were accused of embezzling, and it turned out to be inconclusive whether they did it or not,” Pizzo said.</p>\n<p>“The probability that they are an embezzler is much higher now… [supporters of cultural due process] are saying that an employer should hire this person…even if the probability that they are an embezzler is much higher.”</p>\n<p>Some speakers chose to focus on misconduct allegations, specifically sexual misconduct allegations with little direct evidence, such as first year political science major Ally Baker. She questioned whether the testimony of an accuser should be sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p>“As important as testimonies are…there comes a point when you do need more evidence,” she said. “Are personal testimonies considered evidence?”</p>\n<p>Gates denounced the notion that accusers should be sided with when little evidence is available, pointing to the destructive effect that false accusations can have on the lives of the accused.</p>\n<p>“I really worry about a society where just because the person is a woman and just because there does exist this terrible tragedy of rape that we automatically have to believe every accuser who comes forward. I think that’s bullshit,” Gates said.</p>\n<p>“I think that people downplay the effect that a false accusation can have…Let’s say that the studies that the feminists put forward are true, that 2 to 10 percent are false accusations. Even if it were 2 percent, like that’s fucking crazy to me.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said she was pleased with the way the forum went.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of very constructive and respectful discussion, and it seemed that a lot of people in the room had different opinions on the questions that were posed,” she said.</p>\n<p>As the school year progresses, UCSB College Republicans hopes to hold additional monthly forums to provide spaces for debate on controversial topics, according to Garcia.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/","id":2244,"author":{"id":231,"name":"Eric Wang"},"related":[2243,2242,2241],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBMTD Moves Busses to Increase Capacity on Line 28","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/AliSnavel_BusStop-6.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/AliSnavel_BusStop-6.png?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"UCSB students also make up significant portions of ridership on several other lines, particularly during the academic year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transportation District moved its 60-foot long articulated buses to Line 28 on Oct. 15, according to district spokeswoman Hillary Blackerby.</p>\n<p>An articulated bus is one that can carry two passenger compartments instead of one, allowing more passengers on board.</p>\n<p>The new 60-foot long articulated buses can accommodate approximately 113 people when passengers are standing, Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transportation District’s (SBMTD) 60-foot long buses as well as 40-foot buses will service Line 28 while UC Santa Barbara is in session, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>Generally, the 40-foot long buses serve Lines 11 and 24x, while 30 and 40-foot long buses serve Line 27.</p>\n<p>Only two of SBMTD’s 60-foot buses are in service at any one time.</p>\n<p>A 30-foot long bus can hold approximately 57 people with a standing load, while a 40-foot long bus can hold about 81.</p>\n<p>Most of Line 28’s ridership is UCSB students, according to data from UCSB.

trainee leave the graduate student’s office.</p>\n<p>“I informed [the junior faculty member] of department policy on secure offices for grad students, and copied my department chair, late afternoon,” Sweet said. “She replied that she’d sort it out, and next morning sent an email telling [the junior faculty member] he was out of line, and that I had responded appropriately.”</p>\n<p>Sweet believed the issue was resolved at the time, but the administration presented a formal charge against him and suspended him approximately two and a half months later.</p>\n<p>According to Sweet’s personal inquiry into the matter, the details of the complaint were not the same as Sweet’s understanding of the encounter.</p>\n<p>Sweet was allegedly told that he “stalked” the female undergraduate trainee, “waited until she was alone” and “harassed and bullied her” before she fled, according to Sweet’s Facebook post.</p>\n<p>“The allegation and all of its add-ons are just flat out false,” he said.</p>\n<p>As of late October, Sweet is unable to access his on-campus office and teach classes.</p>\n<p>In an updated Facebook post on Oct. 24, Sweet said one of his courses is canceled and the other is being taught by a grad student.</p>\n<p>“I think this is an example of how hypersensitivity to sexual harassment can be used unfairly to try to settle scores,” Sweet said. “I don’t know what score is being settled here, but it is causing a lot of disruption, not simply to my good name.”</p>\n<p>“I am aware that former students and scientific colleagues worldwide have reacted with incredulity… UCSB is getting a monstrous black eye over this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB did not offer an official statement regarding Sweet’s case.</p>\n<p>Sweet’s full Facebook post can be viewed <a

Attorney General, said in the meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>The External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position was left vacant after the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales last spring.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 25 meeting, Madeline Loudon, the sole candidate for the EVPSA position, argued that the threshold was unlikely to be met.</p>\n<p>Loudon was the runner-up in the Spring 2018 Election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been campaigning on this campus for three years now and I know the feasibility of trying to get students to turnout and I know how apathetic students can be. I believe that we are not going to hit the threshold by the second date for sure,” Loudon said.</p>\n<p>In the meeting minutes, Elections Board Member Andrew Yan noted that the office would still be able to function without the External Vice President For Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p>“There are mechanisms that allow the EVPSA office to continue if that position remains vacant,” Diana Collins Puente, Elections Board advisor, said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate passed a resolution over the summer to allow the duties and funds of the office to be split, stating that a bulk of the position’s duties began over the summer as opposed to Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 24 Senate meeting, Alexandra Gessesse, who has been fulfilling some of the duties of the EVPSA in her position as campaign organizing director, urged the Senate to encourage their constituents to vote.</p>\n<p>“We still haven’t met the threshold, and our office is starting to [get] our nose deep in work regarding requisition forms and things like that,” she said. “We don’t have an EVPSA, and we won’t have one for the entire year, and that’ll be really hard for our office.”</p>\n<p>“Campaign as if you were campaigning for yourself.”</p>\n<p>While Elections Board decided against halving the threshold for the time being, they are putting their efforts toward their “Get Out The Vote” campaign by setting up a voting booth at Pardall Center and a mobile voting booth on campus.</p>\n<p>They also partnered with the A.S. Ticket Office to send an email to students who purchased tickets to the annual Delirium concert put on by A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<p>Loudon did not appear to be actively campaigning by the time Elections Board held their Oct. 11 meeting and was unable to make it to the candidate forum on Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>If the minimum voting threshold is not reached, the EVPSA position will remain vacant until the Spring Quarter 2019 elections.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 3]: This article was updated to include information about the second extension of the deadline. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

#NotWorthIt campaign warns of fines, DUI checkpoints and increased police presence during Halloween.</p>\n<p>The advertisements are targeted toward “non-locals who have no affiliation with UC Santa Barbara,” according to UCSB Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UCSB warns the public about the potential consequences of I.V. Halloween celebrations by publicizing testimonials from regretful Halloween party attendees of the past on various social media platforms, as seen in past and current advertisements.</p>\n<p>The funding for ads decreased from 2017 to 2018, according to Estrada.</p>\n<p>Halloween in 2016 and 2017 saw a significant decrease in police presence. This is part of a noticeable downward trend in the number of police in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Halloweens in 2013 and 2014 saw heavy reports of damage and arrests in I.V. as previously reported on by the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Multiple deputies will be deployed on foot this weekend to the busier streets including Del Playa Drive, Trigo Road and Sabado Tarde, according to Sergeant Daniel Calderon from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</p>\n<p>In anticipation of large crowds, both IVFP and University of California Police Department (UCPD) have increased their available staff, according to Sgt. Calderon.</p>\n<p>The safety of the UCSB’s campus was also a concern this past weekend as a result of Delirium and the soccer game against California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“We’re responsible for the security and safety of the campus, regardless of what’s going on. We are responsive to the crowds and the demeanor and the total activity that is going on,” IVFP Lieutenant Dave Millard said.</p>\n<p>Metal detectors were present at Delirium as part of the security screening at the request of the Thunderdome department.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) reported six citations for minor in possession, four for open container and two for loud music, according to a SBSO representative who attended the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Police issued other citations for public urination, violation of the outdoor festival ordinance and unlicensed driving. Three people were arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>A total of 27 citations and eight arrests were made on Friday and Saturday, according to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson. This number includes citations and arrests made by both SBSO and the UCPD.</p>\n<p>UCPD made five arrests on campus and issued three citations. One person was medically transported for alcohol intoxication on Friday.</p>\n<p>UCPD primarily patrolled campus property and the business district and SBSO patrolled the rest of I.V. during this past weekend, according to Hoover.</p>\n<p>The numbers are similar to last year, when only 25 citations and arrests were made during Halloween weekend by both departments.</p>\n<p>The post-Halloween weekend is expected to be quiet as well. The festival ordinance, preventing loud music or noise, is in effect until Nov. 4. Parking restrictions end on Halloween.</p>\n<p>“That is lower than some typical Friday or Saturday nights in Isla Vista,” Hoover said in an email. “Thanks to everyone for making this a safe and uneventful weekend.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
