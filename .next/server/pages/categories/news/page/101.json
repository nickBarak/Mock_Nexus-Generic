Many of the speakers have witnessed and experienced tragedy and violence, but use their narratives as tools to mobilize change and hold their oppressors accountable, whether through the media, art or memory.</p>\n<p>During Monday’s first panel, Egyptian visual artist Heba Amin spoke about how she and other Egyptians were “caught between hope and despair” during the time of the Revolution, which continues in an ongoing narrative.</p>\n<p>“The sense of possibility was real, or at least that’s how I remember it,” Amin said. “The past must become part of our present.”</p>\n<p>Amin also spoke about how technology was a key factor in the Revolution, as it allowed people to mobilize. Even though the Internet was shut down for almost a week, Amin said the “sentiment that people wanted to preserve their voice for eternity” persevered and started a worldwide discussion.</p>\n<p>The next panelist, curator Sarah Rifky, said the revolution was a way to show the government that its oppression and corruption cannot “fool” the people with “empty promises and sweet talk” and said “patience has its limit.”</p>\n<p>Although Rifky felt out of hope, support and imagination in some moments, she said art spaces pose a threat to the agenda of the government, and even art’s “imaginary conception of what it is and does” is extremely powerful.</p>\n<p>Each activist emphasized that the Egyptian Revolution led to a movement of “global solidarity” that can be related to movements all over the world such as Black Lives Matter and protests throughout Libya, Syria and Yemen.</p>\n<p>Journalist and blogger Wael Eskandar spoke about how one’s memory can serve as a weapon in the face of revolution.</p>\n<p>“The story needs to be told and there is more of the story to be told,” Eskandar said. “To be part of the Revolution is not primarily an Egyptian thing … the narrative is global.”</p>\n<p>Eskandar said the Revolution will endure through memories as a “moral stance.”</p>\n<p>“[The revolution] is neither dead, nor triumphant — it continues,” Eskandar said.</p>\n<p>According to Eskandar, many Egyptians “cannot forget the blood,” and memories of the protests will stay with them.</p>\n<p>“People feel a responsibility to what they’ve witnessed,” Eskandar said.</p>\n<p>Eskandar said Egyptians must use this memory to move forward and use it as a resource against those trying to rewrite the narrative of not only the Egyptian public, but also activists everywhere.</p>\n<p>“Today, there are pockets of resistance through memory,” Eskandar said. “It gives us the opportunity to be keepers of the flame.”</p>\n<p>Dalia Abd El Hameed, Head of the Gender Program at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said she believes the sentiments of the revolution encourage solidarity.</p>\n<p>“[The narrative is about] confronting the silence together,” Hameed said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

None of the three assailants have been found.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit alleges that the UCSB Police Department was “understaffed and insufficiently trained” and says UCSB “did not reach out to a better equipped law enforcement agency to assist with the investigation and management of the case.”</p>\n<p>The student, who is referred to as Jane Doe, believes the assailants were familiar with the specific location because of the direct route they took from I.V. to the hidden area, according to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>After several hours, the student, who began school at UCSB in 2012, was able to escape from the three men. She was recorded on a security camera at around 4 a.m. running back to her residence in I.V., where her roommate called police and medical personnel.</p>\n<p>The victim was then transported to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital where a rape kit was performed, but the lawsuit says the rape kit is “missing significant documentation including photos of her significant injuries.”</p>\n<p>As a result of the attack, the student’s eyes were swollen shut, her nose was broken and she suffered blunt trauma to her knees, hands and abdomen, according to the lawsuit. The student also contracted herpes from one of the attackers and had to take preemptive anti-HIV medication, although the lawsuit does not say she contracted the virus.</p>\n<p>The student is requesting damages from the university for personal injury, negligence related to the premises of the university and both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Although the lawsuit does not specify the amount of money requested from the university, it states that when figures are known, the plaintiff will “amend this Complaint and allege said amounts.”</p>\n<p>A full copy of the lawsuit was <span style=\"color: red;\"><a href=\"http://www.keyt.com/blob/view/-/37650938/data/2/-/10fupes/-/Rape-Case-Complaint-Against-UC-Regents.pdf\"

The selected services, which will be aided by a $200,000 pledge by UCSB after the CSD is created, will be sent to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for approval and placed on the 2016 ballot for voters to a decide on an eight percent utility users tax. The services to be sent to LAFCO are the Municipal Advisory Council, the Tenant Mediation Program, the Area Planning Commission, a parking district, police protection services, community facilities, sidewalks, lighting, gutters, trees and graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>George Thurlow, Alumni Affairs Office assistant vice chancellor, said although the pledged funds will not be available until after the CSD is created, it should still be included in the report to LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“My suggestion would be that you come up with a wish list for two years, 2017 and 2018, a $200,000 budget for each one and decide which projects and programs you want to fund,” Thurlow said. “Put that in front of LAFCO because they’re going to be criticizing [that] it’s not enough money or good enough services.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, field representative for Williams’ office and UC Santa Barbara alumnus, said the term “police protection services” should be defined before deciding on an alternative community policing program that would cost $75,000.</p>\n<p>“To me, it could be contracting law enforcement to host a few self-defense classes every quarter,” Schunk said. “That to me is contracting for additional law enforcement services and that activates that power just fine, and we also have a contract.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said contracting more law enforcement officers from Santa Barbara County or UC Police Department (UCPD) would “tie” the CSD to the police collaborative board.</p>\n<p>“I just wonder whether or not contracting with them is getting actual on-the-job police services or contracting something small like liaison work,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Pargin, second-year math major, said it would be more beneficial to get additional police services from UCPD because it would come out of the university’s budget instead of the CSD’s budget.</p>\n<p>The collaborative program is based on the S.N.A.P. program at Cal Poly which hires students to be first responders and provide campus warnings. Since the university does not want to expand the CSO program into I.V., the contracting cadets would not be UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliot, community organizer from Das Williams’ office, said the CSD could replicate S.N.A.P., but will not be an extension of the program.</p>\n<p>“They could work with student groups with whatever project they’re working on,” Elliot said. “These cadets do not carry weapons and are in training to eventually become officers. It would be better because they would learn to respond without weapons and have training that didn’t incorporate immediate arresting.”</p>\n<p>Jonathon Abboud, Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus, said it would be best to fund as many services as possible through LAFCO’s approval and distribute $200,000 in UCSB pledge funds afterwards.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually better and more effective in the long term with the money we have instead of spreading the budget out way too thin where you couldn’t do that much per year,” Abboud said. “I think it’s a much more prudent approach to LAFCO where you’ve already thought of eight percent.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67671\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67671\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/","id":4581,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[4580,4579,4578],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Currently, the Khan Academy has a library of over 7,000 tutoring videos and receives up to 14 million visitors each month.</p>\n<p>Khan said he spent many afternoons tutoring his cousins and while tutoring his 12-year-old cousin Nadia he had several of what he called ‘aha moments’ that made him realize the impact he could have through education.</p>\n<p>Khan said he is proud to empower students to succeed in disciplines for which they have been told they do not have the “gene.”</p>\n<p>“There’s something very powerful here,” Khan said. “We now can tell the student, ‘Keep working on it. You haven’t mastered it yet,’ because the tools are there now.”</p>\n<p>Khan also said there is “a lot to be done” in terms of education, but he hopes to make his tools available to “level the playing field” for students who don’t have access to other resources.</p>\n<p>“The deck isn’t stacked against them as much as they think,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Hamza Bhatti said Khan’s videos helped him throughout high school in classes like calculus, physics and biology and his younger brother now uses the Academy.</p>\n<p>“It was really cool to hear his voice in person instead of a blackboard,” Bhatti said. “My little brother is in eighth grade right now, so he’s going to be involved with Khan Academy, and that’s why I wanted to come.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67608\" style=\"width: 342px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67608\" data-attachment-id=\"67608\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/salman-khan_by-alex-payne-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Salman Khan (Khan Academy)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67608\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3-682x1024.jpg?resize=332%2C499\" alt=\"Alex Payne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"332\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Payne / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Bhatti said he appreciated Khan’s description of his college experience, in which Khan recounted social and academic challenges.</p>\n<p>“For [Khan] to say that he submitted 40 [job] applications and didn’t get any of them, but then the 41st paid off, it was like the light of day, and something that I want to pass on to my little brother,” Bhatti said.</p>\n<p>Wan Pei Fung, second-year biology major and exchange student from Singapore, said she attended the event because she uses Khan’s videos both at UCSB and in Singapore.</p>\n<p>“I really used a lot of [Khan’s] videos for chemistry and physics so I wanted to come and learn more about Khan Academy,” Fung said.</p>\n<p>Fung said Khan’s statement that “anything worth doing is something you can fail at” encouraged her to take on challenges.</p>\n<p>“For me, I don’t want to do something because I know I’m not good at it, like physics and computer science,” Fung said. “But after that, I realized that I have to try, and that failing might be a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Sydni Baker said that her favorite part of Khan’s lecture was his message to students to participate in activities they enjoy.</p>\n<p>“I feel, like, validated.

The panel discussed the consequences and possible future solutions of the money given to these Political Action Committees (PACs) that are allegedly independent from the candidates they support.</p>\n<p>City council member Gregg Hart said people cannot expect elected officials at every level of government to be looking out for citizens’ best interests, and said citizens should be as knowledgeable as possible about information on social media and television.</p>\n<p>“Education and engagement of citizens at a much more fundamental level about government is really the answer,” Hart said. “It is impossible today to be a passive citizen to have an effect.”</p>\n<p>Hart said oftentimes factions arise that campaign only to their voters, resulting in many opinions getting lost through censorship.</p>\n<p>“As we are overloaded with information, we are censoring ourselves; we are selecting the information we are trying to sort through and to find value in,” Hart said. “In doing that, we are not hearing other people’s perspectives.”</p>\n<p>According to Hart, the amount of money given to political campaigns should not be a deciding factor for voters who have taken the time to learn about the issues and candidates.</p>\n<p>“An uninformed voter [shouldn’t be] persuaded by a goofy television ad that was funded by a corporation,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Jared Daniels, fourth-year political science and history double major and Associated Students external vice president of statewide affairs voter registration director, said the problem is not only within the Executive and Legislative branches, but is in the Judicial branch as well.</p>\n<p>“Citizens United has created an entire generation of Justices which highly benefit from Citizens United, and that all carry on with them throughout their Judicial career,” Daniels said. “So to me, the influence of money and what should be the most nonpartisan, un-ideological branch of government is also subject to the exorbitant amount of funds that are in politics today.”</p>\n<p>Political science professor Eric Smith said the main issue in campaigns is inequality between economic statuses.</p>\n<p>“There has been a huge transfer, bigger than any in this nation’s history, of money from working class, middle class people, to the corporations and the extremely rich are soaking up huge amounts of it and it comes out in public policy,” Smith said. “The cost of going to school or the cost of health insurance that we pay, a whole bunch of policies turn on inequality, and we are all suffering.”</p>\n<p>Smith said one solution could be to give the power to regulate campaign finances back to Congress and state legislatures.</p>\n<p>“If you want to do something about inequality, this would be a huge first step,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Hart said there is a distorted democracy and figuring out ways to work around the existing system of campaigns is unimaginably hard.</p>\n<p>“Changing Citizens United is only a step in that process … there are many other loopholes,” Hart said. “There is so much money at stake in this sort of equation.”</p>\n<p>Hart said the influence of money between Democratic and Republican funded campaigns is “dramatically different.”</p>\n<p>“The judges of the Supreme Court who passed Citizens United [and] who are constantly ruling in ways that protect corporate influence and disadvantage regular people are the Republicans,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Daniels said where the funding is coming from plays a large part in where it is delegated.</p>\n<p>“We have to look that this also includes union money,” Daniels said. “Union money is a factor [which] would by and large benefit the Democratic Party. So of course there is always going to be that question: ‘Does money really affect the voting behavior of elected representatives?’”</p>\n<p>Ezinne Meremikwu, Against Citizens United campaign coordinator at CALPIRG, said CALPRIG is gathering local support to end the corporate funding of elections.</p>\n<p>“We are actually working with the Santa Barbara City Council to basically get Santa Barbara to put themselves on record on being against Citizens United,” Meremikwu said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

until January 2017, composed of over 2,000 book covers to serve as a tribute to the declining use of physical books.</p>\n<p>“Lament” is a 10-by-32 foot art installation located on the first floor of the new addition to the UCSB Library. The art piece was formally presented at the library grand opening ceremony and was complemented by a song composed by Heena Yoon, a UCSB graduate student, and a dance choreographed by Christina McCarthy, UCSB’s professor of modern dance.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Metzger, assistant university librarian for outreach and academic collaboration, said when she first observed Nancy Gifford’s “Lament” at the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Santa Barbara, she thought it would be “perfect” to display in the newly opened library for the year.</p>\n<p>“Usually we actually don’t keep our artwork up for a whole year, but with ‘Lament’ we really wanted to sort of have it be this signature piece that was there for our entire grand opening year,” Metzger said.</p>\n<p>Metzger said the space “Lament” currently occupies will be transformed into other art installations from various artists after this year.</p>\n<p>“We’re calling that space the Mountain Gallery, and we’re open to receiving exhibition proposals from students, from faculty, from curators, from artists who want to show their work in that space,” Metzger said.</p>\n<p>Nancy Gifford, “Lament” artist, said she enjoyed the dance and music piece performed at the library grand opening ceremony to complement her work.</p>\n<p>“When a piece of art inspires other forms of art,” Gifford said. “They performed the whole thing in front of the piece at the opening, and that was really beautiful.”</p>\n<p>Anastasia McCammon, a third-year dance and art history major, said she performed at the ceremony and enjoyed how the dance was different from others she has participated in because it incorporated speaking and improvisation.</p>\n<p>“We were all enthralled,” McCammon said. “We seriously spent most of the rehearsal just deciphering and remarking at the tiny little details, amusing placements and hidden messages of the collage of books, pages, images and bindings. It is incredible how well the mural fit into what our dance aimed to portray.”</p>\n<p>Heena Yoon, a third-year composition major Ph.D. candidate, said she “fell in love” when she first saw the artwork and sees it as a visual embodiment of the musical piece she was working on.</p>\n<p>“I wanted the piece to be an homage to great books and music pieces past and present,” Yoon said. “To be presented by dancers and live musicians right here and now, and to be remembered by the audience throughout their future, not as ‘Heena Yoon’s music’ but as ‘Oh I saw a fun music-dance-theater piece, and it reminded me of the storybooks I loved.’”</p>\n<p>Gifford said she appreciates the unexpected positive responses to her work she received in person and in her comments book despite the work being a “requiem” for books.</p>\n<p>“I looked through [the comments book] a couple weeks ago and I was really moved by all the comments,” Gifford said. “I was very moved by all the things, even the comments that weren’t positive — it doesn’t matter, it’s still a dialogue that’s going on about books, which is what the whole point of it is.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/","id":2582,"author":{"id":135,"name":"Kiana Triana"},"related":[2581,2580,2579],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students, Senate Discuss Free Speech Issues","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Alex-Nagase-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Alex-Nagase-1-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students (A.S.)

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room to accept the resignation of two senators, discuss internal matters and host public forum, which included several students calling for First Amendment reform at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Jason Garshfield, fourth-year political science major, introduced the issue saying, “This right of free expression is under threat at UCSB.” Garshfield presented an article from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (F.I.R.E.) which gave UCSB at a “red light” rating regarding freedom of speech and expression at the University. According to F.I.R.E., a red light university has at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, UCSB’s recent implementation of a “Bias Response Team” poses a threat to students by limiting speech which is labeled as offensive.</p>\n<p>Garshfield proposed drafting a resolution in support of free speech to respond to F.I.R.E.’s rating and improve student freedoms.</p>\n<p>“Free speech is not a point of pride right now. It is a point of shame, and we should all be ashamed at how our university has completely ignored the perfectly legitimate concerns of a perfectly legitimate civil rights organization,” Garshfield said. “Making bigotry something that cannot be expressed does not make it go away… it makes it a black market good.”</p>\n<p>During the question portion of Garshfield’s presentation, Senator Jerel Constantino addressed the senate asking whether Garshfield was a member of the “White Student Union” Facebook group. Garshfield responded to the point saying, “I’m a Jew, but it’s good to know that suddenly I’m a white supremacist.”</p>\n<p>Brandon Morse, fourth-year political science major, said the election code of the student senate also contends with true freedom of speech. Morse described the current university policy as “a regulatory framework that violates the constitution.”</p>\n<p>“The freedom to speak is clear, it’s not up to interpretation. With that being said, the definition of what’s racist is up to interpretation as well,” Morse said. “I’ve been told that as a straight, white male I can not experience racism, but that does not mean on an individual level, you cannot be disparaged.”</p>\n<p>Morse urged the senate to consider Garshfield’s resolution.</p>\n<p>“I may not agree with anything or everything that one of you says but I will certainly fight to the death to protect your right to do so,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>In response to Morse, Senator Akshaya Natarajan suggested the current university policy exists to aid marginalized groups who may be educationally restricted by microaggressions and offensive speech.</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus Derek Dimpfl said limiting speech is, in fact, extremely harmful to student growth and education.</p>\n<p>“I fear that our culture has forgotten, or chosen to forget in whole, or in part, how fortunate it is to have such protections … for what they protect us from is much more frightening than that which they expose us to,” Dimpfl said.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Nawar Nemeh and College of Letters and Science Senator Stevan Abdalmalik both submitted their resignation letters to A.S. Senate earlier this week and presented brief parting messages after public forum.</p>\n<p>“Being at this table, you have an extreme amount of power. I don’t know how many of you know it, but you have the power to alleviate the struggles of human beings. That is an amazing power.” Nemeh said. “I please ask you to weigh every single vote before you make it, to weigh it seriously in your heads as to how it will affect every student on this campus and every community out there.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he was leaving due to personal reasons.</p>\n<p>“I’m resigning, mostly for personal reasons. I thought I owed you all I guess an explanation as to that I want to refocus on my academics, I want to refocus on research that I’ve been doing,” Nemeh said. “I have an internship that I have been neglecting at the U.S. State Department that I need to be putting more time and effort in and I really do want to look more after my family.”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik did not disclose the reason of his resignation, but also had a brief parting in his letter of resignation, read during the public forum portion of senate.</p>\n<p>“In a final farewell, I leave you with this final task: Continue to uphold what’s best in our university, our student body and, most importantly, of yourselves,” Abdalmalik read from his resignation letter. “Hold yourselves to a higher standard, be inquisitive and, most importantly, be self-reflective and self-critical.”</p>\n<p>The resignations were passed in a Senate vote of 15-4-3.</p>\n<p>“A Bill to Restructure the A.S. Fellowship Program” and “A Bill to Amend Article VI of the Constitution &amp; By-Laws to Incorporate a Transfer Senator” were sent to campus affairs while “A Resolution to Ensure Continuity Within the STV Implementation Committee” was sent to immediate consideration and passed the same night.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the

Santa Barbara this quarter.</p>\n<p>The graduate seminar meets in a small classroom in the Humanities and Social Sciences Building and is intended for a maximum of 25 students. Yet, even as the university heads into its third week of the Winter Quarter, there are not enough chairs in the room for all of the fascinated students.</p>\n<p>While Analytic Number Theory may not be what attracts these students, the professor, Dr. Yitang Zhang, does.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably, at this point, one of the most famous mathematicians in the world,” Jeffrey Stopple, UCSB mathematics professor, told the Nexus when Zhang was hired in September. “I think there might be only maybe two or three others alive that have his level of celebrity.”</p>\n<p>Zhang gained fame amongst mathematicians in 2013 after submitting a proof to the Annals of Mathematics, establishing the first finite bound on gaps between twin prime numbers and thus solving the Twin Prime Conjecture, a 150-year-old math problem. At the time, he was working as a part-time calculus teacher at the University of New Hampshire and gained instant recognition, winning a MacArthur Award in 2014, and was promoted to full professorship.</p>\n<p>Zhang’s accomplishment also made its way to the silver screen. The New York Times reported Zhang’s breakthrough a month after his submission, and filmmaker George Csicsery made Zhang the subject of 2015 documentary “Counting from Infinity.”</p>\n<p>Garo Sarajian, a mathematics graduate student at UCSB, said he noticed that people outside of the math world were beginning to recognize Zhang’s name.</p>\n<p>Sarajian said he struck up a conversation with a “random economics student” next to him on the bus, and was surprised that he had already heard of Zhang.</p>\n<p>“Of course I know [Zhang] is a big deal, but I had no idea how big of a deal he was outside the department,” Sarajian said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s math department announced Zhang’s hiring in September. Zhang currently spends much of his time teaching one very popular, overcrowded graduate seminar and conducting further research into number theory.</p>\n<p>“The department did not ask me to teach so much, but I will at times,” Zhang said. “It’s more research time.”</p>\n<p>Zhang said he decided to accept an offer from Chancellor Henry T. Yang in the summer after he was recommended by Harvard University mathematics professor Shing-Tung Yau.</p>\n<p>“I got an email from Professor Yau and, very quickly, I said, ‘Yes I would like to do that,’” Zhang said.</p>\n<p>Zhang remarks that the “feeling” and environment in Santa Barbara is “very different” from New Hampshire. He said he especially enjoys the view of the Santa Ynez Mountains from his office on the sixth floor of South Hall.</p>\n<p>“On a sunny day, you can see the mountain very clearly,” Zhang said. “I really love it here. I will use the good environment to try to do something more.”</p>\n<p>When he is not teaching or researching, Zhang walks around campus and on the beach. Sarajian said Zhang will strike up small conversations with many of the people he passes.</p>\n<p>“He’s very friendly and very approachable,” Sarajian said. “If you didn’t know who he is, you’d think he’s just another very friendly professor.”</p>\n<p>Sarajian, who attends Zhang’s Analytic Number Theory seminar, said Zhang possesses a remarkable ability to engage with his students, whether it be frequently joking with the class or providing insight.</p>\n<p>“He’s not only good at teaching but also at getting [students] excited about what he’s teaching as well,” Sarajian said. “When someone in his position is able to do that, it’s a big deal.”</p>\n<p>Mathematics graduate student Nicolas Brody said Zhang is energetic but modest.</p>\n<p>“However great his achievements, he is a remarkably humble man, and in his Analytic Number Theory course this quarter, he is a very expressive and energetic professor,” Brody said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang said having an “exceptionally dedicated” teacher and mathematician like Zhang on campus boosts the university’s status.</p>\n<p>“His renowned research and scholarship elevate the proud reputation of our university, and now that he is here in the classroom, our students and their education will directly benefit from his brilliance,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Sarajian said he thinks Zhang’s presence will add prestige to the university and attract more students to the program.</p>\n<p>“The school has a celebrity professor we can brag about,” Sarajian said. “It’s amazing how one person does make a difference.”</p>\n<p>Zhang said he hopes to stay at UCSB until his eventual retirement.</p>\n<p>Despite all of his achievements, Zhang said he does not believe he has yet reached the pinnacle of his career.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to keep going up,” Zhang said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67541\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/esteemed-professor-teaches-popular-seminar/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67541\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/esteemed-professor-teaches-popular-seminar/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/esteemed-professor-teaches-popular-seminar/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/esteemed-professor-teaches-popular-seminar/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/esteemed-professor-teaches-popular-seminar/","id":2556,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2555,2554,2553],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"EVPSA ‘Principles’ Draft Calls for Student Input","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Principles_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Principles_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Office of the A.S.

Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>The Office of the A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) is now asking for feedback from UCSB students on the content of UC Board of Regents’ first “Principles Against Intolerance,” which is currently being developed by a working group within the Board.</p>\n<p>The Principles Against Intolerance is a statement first drafted by the working group July 2015 stating what it considers to be “intolerable” acts, including acts of discrimination and racism. The Office of the EVPSA asks students to share what they consider to be hate speech and to share their experiences with acts of hate via welisten@sa.ucsb.edu by Jan. 30. The feedback will then be sent to the Board, who will not see names of students who participate.</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, EVPSA and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major, said the Principles Against Intolerance aim to address all types of hate students might face on campus.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the statement against intolerance is to better understand the kind of challenges students are facing, not only in regards to anti-Semitism,” Mirza said, “but also in regards to anti-black, homophobia, racism and hate, which is unfortunately much more prevalent than people realize on the UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he encourages students to submit feedback in order to “take advantage of that opportunity” to communicate their experiences to the Regents.</p>\n<p>“I really want to encourage students who are affected by this issue and who are passionate about it to take the time to fill out their feelings and send it in to the email address provided, because it’s not often that the UC Regents takes this much student input in the crafting of policy,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>According to Aaron Jones, Graduate Student Association president, the Board will use feedback they receive to identify the main issues students face that should be addressed in the Principles Against Intolerance.</p>\n<p>“[The Board] will use the information by looking at the issues and challenges to address in the statement,” Jones said. “How to phrase the statement in a way that respects freedom of speech but also acknowledges the problems that people are facing and fully cover the broad scope of the issue.”</p>\n<p>Jones said Student Regent Avi Oved and Student Regent Designate Marcela Ramirez drafted a more “holistic” statement against hate speech despite requests from several Board members to tailor the statement to the issue of anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>“It put the current student regent, who is Jewish, in a precarious position, because he essentially informed us that although it is important to him to fight anti-Semitism, he didn’t feel as though it was the only form of intolerance that needed to be identified,” Jones said. “We have to include intolerance against people of color, the LGBT community, women; it needed to be more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Akshaya Natarajan, off-campus senator and second-year Asian American studies and political science double major, said the student regents, Oved and Ramirez, want to improve student representation at the Board through this opportunity to collect feedback.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s not often that the UC Regents takes this much student input in the crafting of policy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>“What the student regents this year wanted to do was to really increase the amount of student input on the statement of principles against intolerance,” Natarajan said. “I think it’s very much towards increasing student input and making sure students feel like they have the ability to give input on policy and official UC stances about free speeches.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan said she attended an open forum on the Principles at UCLA and witnessed many students with “charged” opinions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of it seemed to focus on the issue of divestment and general conversations of anti-Semitism and free speech on campus,” Natarajan said. “I think that’s the larger picture that we should be looking at: Perhaps not so much one conversation that happens, but perhaps the scope of all sorts of controversial discussions that happen on campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, some have expressed concerns that the Principles Against Intolerance will infringe upon the First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p>“I think that whole particular argument needs to be flushed out more because it’s just a way of pigeonholing the conversation to say, ‘I have the ability to say anything I want to’ and not have to face repercussions when that is legally is not the case,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said the statement would not affect classroom discussions between students and faculty.</p>\n<p>“The entity responsible for classroom experience is academic senate, it’s the faculty,” Jones said. “There may be the statement. There may be broader parameters that are put forth as ideals. But in terms of the academic environment, that is the sole responsibility of the faculty.”</p>\n<p>Jones said the discussion of hate speech and intolerance will still continue after the statement is complete.</p>\n<p>“My hope with the ongoing conversation is that something can be agreed upon now,” Jones said. Maybe it’s not the end-all, be-all, but we can continue working on it. So it’s not something that is static.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan said the statement is still very broad and could lead to interpretations that suggest violations of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pretty short statement, it’s not really all inclusive,” Natarajan said. “So it does leave a lot up to interpretation, and as a result of that, there is a lot of perhaps confusion on what these principles could mean.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

UCSB’s Startup Weekend Friday through Sunday at Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>The event allowed attendees to connect with sponsors and company representatives from Dandelion Nitro, SB Hackers, StartupSB, I.V. Cuts, Impact Radius and Citrix. Participating entrepreneurs pitched their ideas on Friday and looked for members to add to their teams. Attendees voted for the top 15 teams, and these teams competed Saturday and Sunday to build the best product.</p>\n<p>The top teams also competed with teams from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, which was hosting its own Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>Clint Nelsen, co-founder of Startup Weekend and CEO of Ticketbase, brought the event, which takes place in 135 countries, to Santa Barbara in 2009.</p>\n<p>“Over an impromptu lunch, we shook hands to buy the company from [previous owner Andrew Hyde] for about $150,000, and we didn’t have a penny in our bank accounts,” Nelsen said.</p>\n<p>Mark Cardona, who graduated from UCSB in 2009, said his interest in entrepreneurship began with selling candy out of his backpack in middle school.</p>\n<p>“I actually made quite a bit of money doing that, and ever since then I have been trying to build other businesses,” Cardona said.</p>\n<p>ProductPlan founder Jim Semick shared advice on building a business and finding lean market validation.</p>\n<p>“A lot of products come to market, and the founders and people who are starting the company are really excited about it,” Semick said. “They believe their ideas can change the world, and unfortunately the world doesn’t care sometimes. This [weekend] is really the lowest-risk chance for you to get in front of people and talk about your idea.</p>\n<p>Navjot Brar, president of UCSB’s Entrepreneurs Association and fourth-year mechanical engineering major, said there were more student attendees than in past years.</p>\n<p>“This year it is a whole new UCSB crowd and new people being introduced to this Startup Weekend,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>Startup Weekend, which has taken place downtown in past years, was moved to UCSB in part due to financial reasons, according to Brar.</p>\n<p>Brar said Associated Students gave the group $8,000, which was used to buy supplies for the weekend.</p>\n<p>“We have 3D printers set up, we give everyone a free website domain, we give mentorship, presentation feedback — literally everything that you need in a weekend,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>Brar said meeting people who have their own companies is students’ favorite part of Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>“There was a survey of Startup Weekend, and the number one thing people love the most is the networking. It is just fun, it is natural — it brings you out of your comfort zone,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>15 teams presented a product on Sunday night to six judges.</p>\n<p>Closed Cycle, a bike security device, and Triameter, a room 3D scanner, tied for first.</p>\n<p>Owen Roth, a team member for Closed Cycle, said tying for first “feels awesome,” and the weekend was a rewarding experience that allowed him to engage with new people.</p>\n<p>“The whole experience was an adrenaline rush that put you through a lot of sleepless nights, and then it was a lot of interacting with really intelligent people that had a lot of knowledge,” Roth said. “It was an intense learning experience and so educational. For me it was like going back to college again.”</p>\n<p>Bernie Corea, a team member from Triameter and a third-year economics major, said he did not know anyone on his winning team before beginning the competition.</p>\n<p>“I came here not knowing what to expect,” Corea said. “We started off with initially drone attachments and pivoted very quickly to creating something for real estate agencies to be able to map.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>\n<p>Attendees marched from Cheadle Hall to Storke Plaza, passing through North Hall, the site of an occupation by the Black Student Union in 1968 which lead to the creation of the Black Studies Department in the UC system. Five people spoke Tuesday on King’s message and legacy.</p>\n<p>LaDonte King, assistant director for government affairs, used the weather to emphasize the resilience of the marchers.</p>\n<p>“We’re battling the elements,” King said. “Whether it be rain, racism or injustice, we stand strong in spite of it all. Today’s march is an example of that.”</p>\n<p>King said the march is mostly silent in order to minimize distraction and honor the movement.</p>\n<p>“It is not until we are able to clear our distractions and actually be in silence that we can actually start to hear,” King said. “That is the purpose of this march today: so that we can take some time to actually be in silence and to remember.”</p>\n<p>When the group stopped at North Hall, Aaron Jones, the president of the Graduate Student Association, explained the importance of North Hall.</p>\n<p>“I imagine everyone who woke up that day [in 1968] — with the exception of a select few — had no idea that by the time they rose, 12 students had walked into this building at six o’clock in morning and told the folks there, ‘you’re going to have to leave,’” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said that the act of “nonviolent civil disobedience” had an effect larger than the pictures that now adorn the walls of North Hall.</p>\n<p>“That very act of civil disobedience, of nonviolent civil disobedience, inspired a movement that is not only captured in these images, but in movement that literally reverberates and reverberated around the world,” Jones said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67485\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67485\" data-attachment-id=\"67485\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/students-faculty-brave-the-rain-for-silent-march/march_by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1279&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1279\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"March_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C568&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67485 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x655.jpg?resize=888%2C568\" alt=\"March_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" width=\"888\" height=\"568\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C655&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=768%2C491&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67485\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, the vice president of statewide affairs for Associated Students and fourth-year sociology major, said MLK’s “human qualities” made him an effective leader.</p>\n<p>“I think often about how Dr. King must’ve felt in all these different moment of his life.

Senate met Wednesday to discuss a bill amending the legal code of an Office of Student Advocacy bill and a resolution asking for “immediate” action in support of those without legal status.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The first proposal, “A Resolution Requesting Immediate Action in Support of the Undocumented Community,” was partially written by Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (I.D.E.A.S.), a group advocating for the rights of undocumented immigrants at UCSB. The resolution urged A.S. to form a temporary committee to work with I.D.E.A.S. and to increase access to Counseling and Psychological Services for undocumented students. The resolution was written in response to recent Immigration and Custom Enforcement (I.C.E.) raids in California and the expected presence of Customs and Border Patrol recruiters at the Winter Career Fair. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Abby Salazar, a student sponsor of the bill and fourth-year Chican@ studies and black studies double major, said she had opened the door of her home to I.C.E. officers, not knowing “that action would change the rest of my life.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“They immediately handcuffed my mom and sat me down,” Salazar said. “They took her away and I went into a state of panic. It’s been six years that my mom hasn’t been able to return to her home that my parents have worked for after so many years.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Salazar said many undocumented students are currently living in fear after news of the I.C.E. raids and deportations. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“A lot of people started celebrating New Years, but we started our year with fear,” Salazar said. “We think coming back to school would be a safe space because back at home, it’s not a safe space because our families and friends are in danger of being deported”. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Mariel Islas, second-year history of public policy major, said recent news of I.C.E. raids coupled with border patrol recruiters attending the career fair may trigger fear and panic in undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“When customs and border patrol comes to the career fair, C.A.P.S. should be on hand with more psychologists and therapists,” Islas said. “That way, students who do feel triggered have the ability and the means to contact someone in C.A.P.S. who are able to help them.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Islas said she collaborated with A.S. senators Alejandra Melgoza and Jose Magana, who proposed that she write a resolution.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Alejandra Melgoza, an off-campus senator and third-year Chican@ studies major, said she supports the resolution because of the stress and pressure undocumented students have to face while pursuing their education. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“There have been a lot of raids in our community,” Melgoza said. “There are articles that state they are continuing in Santa Barbara county, so this presents a lot of mental health stress not only on these students here in this community, but they also worry about their families back home, friends, community members.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In the fall of 2013, the 64th A.S Senate voted against passing “A Resolution in Support of Undocumented Student and Immigrant Communities,” which requested A.S. express no confidence toward former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, who is now president of the University of California.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Salazar said it is important for Senate to repair its relationship with the undocumented student population at UCSB in order to fully represent the student body. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Two years after, A.S. Senate voted down the previous resolution, Salazar said, “Now we’re back in the same place. We’re coming here for the 66th Senate to amend those actions and to really support undocumented students right now because undocumented students are facing really difficult times.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“A Bill to Amend Lobby Corps Legal Code” and “A Bill to Update CFF By-Laws” were sent to Campus Affairs. “A Bill to Amend the Legal Code of the OSA Bill” and “A Resolution Requesting Immediate Action in Support of the Undocumented Community” were passed unanimously. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\n</p><p class=\"p4\">[Correction: This story originally read  “a resolution asking for ‘immediate’ action in support of those who immigrated to the country illegally.” The wording was changed to “those without legal status” to more accurately describe the purpose of the resolution.]</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print
