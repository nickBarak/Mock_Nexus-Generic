Stelzer was infected by meningococcal meningitis serogroup B, the same strain contracted by four students at UCSB, according to multiple San Diego news sources such as U-T San Diego, UC San Diego’s the Guardian and NBC San Diego.</p>\n<p>Vice President of Student Affairs at SDSU Eric Rivera released a statement on Stelzer’s death on Friday.</p>\n<p>“We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our students to this terrible illness,” Rivera stated. “After speaking with her family, we know that Sara was a vibrant young woman who loved San Diego State, her friends and the time she spent at our university.  It is always difficult when a young life is lost, especially when that person is part of our SDSU family.”</p>\n<p>Meningococcal meningitis serogroup B is a rare, lethal disease that attacks the outer lining of the brain. Although there is no currently approved vaccination for serogroup B in the U.S., UCSB and Princeton University gained FDA approval to use the unlicensed vaccine, according to Student Health Director Mary Ferris.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB we obtained special permission earlier this year to offer a Meningococcal serogroup B vaccine that is licensed in Europe, Canada, Australia and Great Britain, but not in the USA,” Ferris said. “We were only allowed to give it to undergraduates in February and April, and now we are anxiously awaiting its approval so we can give it to more students.”</p>\n<p>Ferris said the bacteria is spread through direct and indirect physical contact.</p>\n<p>“It is thought to be spread through close contact with respiratory secretions via the mouth and nose, e.g. sharing cups, glasses and smoking materials and intimate mouth-to-mouth contact,” Ferris said in email. “It is not thought to be airborne.”</p>\n<p>According to Ferris, part of the reason this particular strain is so dangerous is because it rapidly attacks the human body.</p>\n<p>“It mainly attacks young healthy people and infants, and can be deadly within 24 hours. Once the bacteria gets in the bloodstream or spinal and brain fluid, it seems to overwhelm the immune system before your body has a chance to fight it off,” Ferris said, “For survivors the complications are often severe, such as brain damage, skin damage and even amputations because the infection impairs circulation.”</p>\n<p>Student Health Advice Nurse Holly Smith said Student Health is accepting students that want the vaccine.</p>\n<p>“We do have the meningococcal vaccine,” Smith said. “People can walk in daily and get that, if they request it first.”</p>\n<p>Smith also said the best way to avoid getting the disease is to stay informed about ways to contract and spread the disease.</p>\n<p>“We need to educate, educate, educate,” Smith said. “How does the disease spread, and how can I avoid getting it?”</p>\n<p>Both Ferris and Smith confirmed that once the serogroup B vaccination is available in the U.S., the university will be ordering and administering them as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Map courtesy of <em>sedgwick.nrs.ucsb.edu</em></p></div>\n<p>On Monday, the university announced that alumna Linda Duttenhaver donated $2 million towards the restoration of a 1950s ranch house on Sedgwick Reserve which accommodates affiliated researchers from half of the approximately 40 projects on the reserve.</p>\n<p>The donation will go towards bringing the Sedgwick ranch house up-to-date with fire and building codes, followed by renovating the facility to make it more comfortable and functional for residents. The Sedgwick Reserve is located 40 miles north of campus in the Santa Ynez Valley and is one of seven reserves managed by the university’s Natural Reserve System (NRS), a branch of the greater UC Natural Reserve System which oversees 39 reserves in total throughout the state.</p>\n<p>According to Sedgwick Reserve Resident Director Kate McCurdy, the money may be used to update specific parts of the house.</p>\n<p>“We hope to modernize the really funky old 1950s kitchen, to make it useful for people to cook,” McCurdy said. “Right now the house is set up in a dorm style with lots of bunk beds so we’re also going to replace the bunk beds with double beds.”</p>\n<p>Patricia Holden, professor of environmental microbiology in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management and director of the Natural Reserve System, said the mission of the UC NRS is to “support broadly university level research, education and public outreach.”</p>\n<p>According to Holden, all UC NRS projects are “approached with the lens of sustainability,” and make energy and water conservation an important criteria throughout the design process.</p>\n<p>“We currently produce our own energy here with solar panels,” McCurdy said. “Now we want to replace the windows and possibly do rainwater capture off the roof, and also replace the heating system so it is more energy efficient.”</p>\n<p>McCurdy said Duttenhaver is “one of those rare gem alumni,” who has made significant contributions to Sedgwick Reserve over the last few years.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important to her to see students use what they’re learning in the classroom out in the field,” McCurdy said. “She definitely recognizes that having a decent place to stay when you’re out on the edge of wilderness is very important. For students and faculty to really be inspired by the place they’re working at, they need to be comfortable and safe.”</p>\n<p>McCurdy also said some of Duttenhaver’s past donations have aided the renovation of the ranch’s historic barn, as well as the development of an outreach program.</p>\n<p>“That barn was so close to falling over and it was pretty scary to be in there on a windy day because you could see the whole thing moving,” McCurdy said. “So she really did save that from the brink of collapse. Then our outreach program allows us to have public hikes and a lecture series. So without her help it would be pretty quiet out here.”</p>\n<p>NRS Business Officer Donna Moore said the NRS provides researchers and students a protected environment for their studies.</p>\n<p>“Researchers can come and set up an experiment or classes can come and get involved in a project and they know that it won’t be disturbed,” said Moore. “It also protects the area, keeping them as restored to their original condition as they could possibly be, and gives researchers a place to stay and keep their equipment.”</p>\n<p>Various research efforts are pursued at the reserve within fields including botany, archaeology, microbiology and geology. According to McCurdy, native plants and animals thrive in an undisturbed habitat. Additionally, a telescope is also being used at the Sedgwick Reserve by the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Network, a nonprofit network of robotic telescopes used for science and education.</p>\n<p>“We are sort of at the southern end of the Transverse Range and we have a unique soil type that is high in turpentine that invasive plants don’t do very well in, so we have a lot of native plants that aren’t found elsewhere,” McCurdy said.</p>\n<p>McCurdy also said a grant has been submitted to gain funding for the construction of a 24-bed dormitory adjacent to the ranch house, with a groundbreaking set for 2016.</p>\n<p>“Classes will then be able to use the dorm and researchers and people who are staying longer will be able to use the ranch house,” McCurdy said.</p>\n<p>According to McCurdy, Sedgwick Reserve is “a little national park” and a place where “you will never know what you’re going to encounter.” McCurdy also said the reserve offers visitors many surprises and a natural habitat worth protecting.</p>\n<p>“What amazes me about this property is how enormous and rich it is,” McCurdy said. “You can see deer and bears and eagles, or you may see animal tracks or a freshly killed deer that a mountain lion just killed. So there’s evidence of just how biologically important this place is. This really is the perfect place to have a reserve.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57255\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57255\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/","id":2981,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2980,2979,2978],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Internal Vice President Angela Lau began the discussion by addressing the current bills in question and moved the conversation to Senate member inquiries before allowing time for public forum.</p>\n<p>Diane O’Brien, executive assistant to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, gave an update prior to public forum about an ongoing housing shortage for international students.</p>\n<p>“We’re currently trying to work with them to find out how many have and don’t have housing at the moment,” O’Brien said. “What I’ve been told is that, for whatever reason, the housing market has been impacted and that it was an unexpected thing. The school isn’t overenrolled, the students are just having difficulty finding housing.”</p>\n<p>After public forum, a motion was introduced to permit the videotaping of Senate meetings in order to have them available for public viewing. The motion was voted on and then sent to the Constitution and Bylaws Committee for further consideration.</p>\n<p>Diversity Educator for the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) Kyron Covington requested Senate funding for the upcoming Student of Color Conference, to take place on Nov. 7 to 9 at UC Merced. Covington said the conference was a chance for students of color to discuss issues relevant to “color culture” and their specific universities.</p>\n<p>“It is a chance to celebrate students of color culture and talk about issues that they can bring back to their respective campuses,” Covington said.</p>\n<p>Senator Liam Stanton also requested A.S. President Ali Guthy to fund the Student of Color Conference with presidential funds. Guthy said an examination of the budget was necessary before any funds could be appropriated.</p>\n<p>Third-year literature major and former Student Advocate General Bailey Loverin also sponsored an update to A.S. Legal Code Article VII Sections 3 and 8-10, with the intent of preventing what she alleged was the unjust removal of A.S. staff.</p>\n<p>“[The bill] does not allow executives to remove appointed officers without consent of the Senate,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marcela Marquez brought up issues of student health and the possibility of establishing “peace zones” in the school to aid students dealing with various stages of post-traumatic stress.</p>\n<p>“The administration and the Chancellor are working together to develop peaceful areas in the school for students to be able to relax,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>Senate questions were addressed towards the end of the meeting, with Lau encouraging Senators to spread news of the upcoming special A.S. Election for Student Advocate General and External Vice President of Local Affairs in order to gain results reflective of the entire student body.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57251\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57251\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/","id":2983,"author":{"id":171,"name":"Diana Bounina"},"related":[2982,2981,2980],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Questions Television Episode","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  NBC TV Network aired an episode of crime series “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” last Wednesday featuring alleged similarities to the Isla Vista tragedy that occurred last May.

The episode has sparked discussion among students, staff and Isla Vista residents about the alleged connection between the episode and what occurred in last May.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students President Ali Guthy, the episode’s similarity to the May 23 tragedy calls for community solidarity.</p>\n<p>“The most recent ‘Law &amp; Order SVU’ episode portrays a disturbing connection to the horrific events that darkened our UCSB community this past May 23rd,” Guthy said. “In times such as these, I would like to remind everyone to support one another, take care of one another and utilize the important services offered to the entire campus community.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said moving past the tragedy is something the community must do together.</p>\n<p>“This tragedy is not something we will move forward from easily,” Guthy said. “It will take time, patience and the love of one another and our community to become stronger and heal together.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major Nathan Silverglate said that because the episode was not in documentary form, it was not appropriate to air.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a little bit inappropriate for them to be making an episode on television about a large tragedy that’s not a documentary,” Silvergate said.</p>\n<p>However, Silverglate said he supports the First Amendment rights of the producers of “Law &amp; Order” as well as their right to make controversial material.</p>\n<p>“We do have freedom of speech in this country, so if that’s what they want to do, they can do it,” Silverglate said.</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies major Jordan Fabula said he supports the producers’ apparent inspiration from what happened in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a very smart idea. With his background and his actions, I think Elliot Rodger would make a great TV or movie villain,” Fabula said. “It’s just a TV show, people should not get offended just because they’re playing off of events that happened in real life.”</p>\n<p>Third-year actuarial science major Jonah Rockowitz said the actor was so similar to Elliot Rodger that he could not watch it past the two-minute mark.</p>\n<p>“I tried watching the episode and about two minutes in I was too creeped out because the actor did a good job portraying Elliot Rodger and I could not watch the rest of the episode,” Rockowitz said.</p>\n<p>According to Rockowitz, the episode’s evident similarity to the I.V. tragedy made it difficult to watch.</p>\n<p>“I think it was uncomfortable for me because I’m so close to the incident, whereas I watch other things that are close to other incidents that I’m not close to,” Rockowitz said. “I am okay that they made it because that is what TV shows do; however it was uncomfortable for me to watch.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The piece is meant to reflect the community as a whole in the wake of the recent calamity. <em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College media and design student Ana Corrigan completed her most recent mural inside Coffee Collaborative on Pardall Road last Thursday.</p>\n<p>The mural depicts a girl with her hair transforming into a wave that sits on a sunset, as well as a skunk with a mug of coffee and a raccoon smoking a cigarette and reading a book. A tree painted to the left of the photo has six leaves, each dedicated to one of the students who lost their lives last May.</p>\n<p>Coffee Collaborative owner Steve McDonough said the idea of redoing the mural has been in the works for about a year, but it was not until recently that he decided to replace the old mural with something that better reflected the community.</p>\n<p>“Ana asked me … ‘Is it okay if I make a mural?’ and I thought we should probably redo it anyways,” McDonough said. “I was really hesitant, but it came out so much better than I suspected.”</p>\n<p>According to McDonough, the mural’s dedication to the six victims makes the painting personal for him and other Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>“We got a bullet through our window,” McDonough said, “and those leaves, each one is one of the victims.”</p>\n<p>Corrigan said she envisioned the mural from the start as a tribute to the victims of the shooting.</p>\n<p>“At first I wanted to do turtles … but putting the initials in the tree leaves was about midway in the process,” Corrigan said, “but I wanted to do the tribute from the very beginning.”</p>\n<p>Corrigan also said it was important that the piece incorporate an aspect of last May’s tragedy in order to commemorate the students who passed away.<br>\n“People are going to never forget,” Corrigan said. “When people pass away, you get this explosion of sympathy, and I wanted something always there for them to be remembered.”</p>\n<p>According to Corrigan, she chose to contribute her artwork to the Coffee Collaborative because it spotlights both student art and local musical talent.</p>\n<p>“I just feel like everyone has their own contribution to this place because there’s so many local art places, and you know people come here and play their music, they have their open mic nights,” Corrigan said. “It’s the only place in Isla Vista where students can, like, contribute … whether they’re doing homework or hanging out.”</p>\n<p>Corrigan said she has displayed many of her much smaller pieces before, but the mural is her largest to date.</p>\n<p>“Size-wise this is the biggest painting I have ever done,” Corrigan said, “but I have been selling my paintings for about a year now, a lot smaller than that.”</p>\n<p>Although the girl’s hair transforming into the wave was Corrigan’s idea, she said McDonough prompted her to put the skunk and raccoon in the mural. According to Corrigan, it took about a week to complete the mural, and while she was not paid to do the work, McDonough paid for the paints she used.</p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Lectures</h4>\n<p>Michael Lewis, acclaimed author of <em>Moneyball, The Blind Side</em> and <em>Flash Boys,</em> came to the Granada Theatre Tuesday night to speak about his experience as a financial journalist, storyteller and self-proclaimed sloth.</p>\n<p>Hosted by Arts &amp; Lectures, NPR business reporter Sonari Glinton moderated the evening, beginning with an interview portion and allowing time at the end for an audience question and answer session.</p>\n<p>Lewis said he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Art History and went on to the London School of Economics to graduate with a degree in Economics.</p>\n<p>“I was very, very lucky in that before I entered University, my father told me to find and study what I loved,” Lewis said. “In exchange he would give me a three-year buffer after I left school in which he would pay for my living expenses and education.”</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, the offer from his father was instrumental for his career.</p>\n<p>“It was during this time that I discovered I wanted to be a writer, and shortly after that I discovered I had to do something to make up for my Art History degree,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Lewis included anecdotes from his childhood in Louisiana, describing the environment of New Orleans by quoting the family motto his father once told him.</p>\n<p>“Do as little as possible, for it is better to receive a slight reprimand than perform an arduous task,” Lewis said. “A very large part of my life is dedicated to avoiding unpleasant chores.”</p>\n<p>Lewis went on to discuss the process that is involved in finding a story and putting it on paper and how the story of <em>The Blind Side</em> came to be, beginning with how he discovered it.</p>\n<p>“I went to visit a friend of mine from high school in Memphis one year,” Lewis said. “When I got to his house, there was a six-foot-tall, 350-pound black kid sitting in the living room of a white Republican Evangelical Christian in the most segregated city in America … and no one said anything about it.”</p>\n<p>Lewis continued to describe how the story progressed over the year and how he came to terms with writing a story that eventually turned into a movie about his best friend’s family, as well as his experience working as a writer in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“It was great! Movie people are great, they fear the writer,” Lewis said. “They would solicit my opinion and then completely ignore what I said, they just wanted to make sure I would stay nice. But both ‘Moneyball’ and ‘Blindside’ turned out to be truly good films.”</p>\n<p>Lewis also said it is a highly impersonal process to have a personal work turned into a Hollywood hit.</p>\n<p>“The stupidity in Hollywood is not at the level of actors, writers and directors,” Lewis said. “There’s some truly beautiful storytelling that happens there. The stupidity in Hollywood lies in the business decisions.”</p>\n<p>Lewis concluded the discussion by answering audience questions and touching on what it means to be a good writer.</p>\n<p>“People who are really good storytellers tend to have very distinctive voices on the page, people are afraid of their individuality and once they start mimicking their favorite writers, their value is gone,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, his future plans include writing a book about U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>“He has really let me into his life like no other journalist, and if I’m able to write this book the way I want, six months after the end of his presidency people will want nothing more than to read a book about Obama,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Glinton said she enjoyed meeting Lewis, whom he admires for his rare talent.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of those weird things when you’re meeting someone who you’ve known and followed and then you meet them and realize you don’t have to be scared about it,” Glinton said. “He’s a natural storyteller, and genuine, real, accomplished storytellers are few and far between. He’s one of the masters right now.”</p>\n<p>Glinton also said he thought Lewis’ advice would be of practical use to students.</p>\n<p>“Something he said to the student about doing what you like really stuck with me also, it’s ridiculous to tell someone to follow their dreams,” Glinton said. “But students should really be in pursuit of what they like to do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major and Arts &amp; Lectures student manager for the event Lauren Cassis agreed and said she enjoyed his discussion about his books and his time as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>“I thought he was very insightful and I liked how his conversation was very broad in the topics,” Cassis said. “Hearing about ‘The Blind Side,’ how the story came together, was very interesting.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An earlier version of this article used the pronoun “she” when referencing to Sonari Glinton, when in actuality the article should have used “he”.]</em></p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57284\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57284\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/","id":2987,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2986,2985,2984],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Billionaire Donates Over $65 Million to UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Charles Munger, Vice President of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., has donated just over $65 million dollars in stocks to UCSB to house visiting physicists.

It’s all done. The cash is in the bank.”</p>\n<p>According to Munger, the donation would serve to provide a place for physicists from around the world to convene on campus.</p>\n<p>“This donation is to provide a residence for these most important physicists in the world that come to UCSB all the time to these conferences where they interchange ideas about physics and so on, and helping that program which I greatly admire,” Munger said.</p>\n<p>According to Munger, creating a space for world-class physicists to meet and conduct research is imperative to scientific progress.</p>\n<p>“These programs where visiting physicists get together are a very old thing in the world,” Munger said. “Remember Einstein and Madam Curie and all those people? [They] used to meet in Belgium in the twenties. It has always been important that these great physicists get together.”</p>\n<p>Munger also said the university is the best possible place to host top-notch scientists.</p>\n<p>“The achievements of UCSB are so great, that now the one place where they all come is UCSB,” Munger said. “It’s by far the most important gathering place for the best physicists in the world, they’re there all the time, they have program after program all year long.”</p>\n<p>According to Munger, his donation toward scientific progress will help bolster what he views as a suffering nationwide public school system.</p>\n<p>“I regret that the public school system, which was pretty good when I was young, has had such enormous deterioration in our central cities. Some of the most brilliant minds in the country have tried to fix that and have had great trouble with it,” Munger said. “That’s why I give to visiting physicists. I know that will work.”</p>\n<p>Charles Munger III, Munger’s grandson and UCSB alumnus, said his grandfather has been involved with the university for several years.</p>\n<p>“He actually gave a talk back in 2007 or 2006 before I applied to UCSB and I’ve been going up and hanging out in Santa Barbara for quite a while,” Munger III said.</p>\n<p>According to Munger, his grandson’s attendance was not his sole reason for donating.</p>\n<p>“I am very grateful for the great education that my grandson had, but I gave them the money because I so admire the program that brings all these visiting physicists to UCSB,” Munger said. “It’s the most important program of that kind in the world, and number two is not close.”</p>\n<p>With regards to his grandfather, Munger III said that his affiliation with Munger’s reputation is “an honor.”</p>\n<p>“He’s known for having high integrity, for being really honest and honorable, not really for screwing anyone over,” Munger III said. “It does make it a lot easier. When people say ‘Charles Munger,’ it’s never anything bad. It’s always like ‘What a fantastic person.’”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

preparing for college,” Napolitano stated. “That includes taking preliminary college entrance exams and enrolling in academically-challenging courses that can help prepare students for college and increase their chances for admission at UC.”</p>\n<p>According to UCOP spokeswoman Shelly Meron, the UC is trying to prepare prospective students for the pre-SAT through its Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) getting “the word out.”</p>\n<p>“The ‘All In’ campaign is really about using our early academic outreach program to work with the College Board on this campaign,” Meron said, “so our UC staff through EAOP is going to be working with school districts that we partner with to give them resources, to let them know about AP courses and which students in their school are showing potential for AP courses.”</p>\n<p>Meron also said a contributing factor for students not enrolling in AP classes is a lack of information.</p>\n<p>“One thing that could be going on is that maybe they don’t know about the courses that are available at their school, maybe they’re not sure what the PSAT is or how to sign up,” Meron said. “These are all things we hope to address through outreach and education and training and that’s why we’ll target parents and high school parents.”</p>\n<p>The statement also said that in the high school graduating class of 2014, 49 percent of students took PSAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualification Test (NMSQT), and 35 percent of test-takers in California demonstrated potential for success in one or more AP classes. However, 31 percent of those who proved to have AP capabilities were not enrolled in a corresponding Advanced Placement course according to the statement.</p>\n<p>Amy Wilkins, College Board Senior Fellow for Social Justice and Director of the “All In” campaign, said in the statement that she supports the UC’s willingness to take steps to better represent students.</p>\n<p>“The College Board believes that all students should have access to the opportunities they have earned,” Wilkins said. “We are delighted that the University of California is also working on breaking down barriers for underrepresented minority students who show the potential to succeed in AP classes.”</p>\n<p>According to the statement, the PSAT and NMSQT not only provide early results for skills necessary in college, but also give students the chance to compete in scholarship programs, gain placement in AP courses and utilize other college preparation resources. The UC staff plans to be in contact with several California school districts such as Fresno, the Inland Empire, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco to provide resources to AP teachers.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57147\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-22/ucop-aims-to-grow-ap-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57147\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-22/ucop-aims-to-grow-ap-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-22/ucop-aims-to-grow-ap-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-22/ucop-aims-to-grow-ap-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-22/ucop-aims-to-grow-ap-program/","id":3453,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3452,3451,3450],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SB Looks For Alternatives During Drought","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Lake Cachuma, a major source of water for Santa Barbara residents, has declined to 30 percent capacity this October due to prolonged drought conditions.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57152\" style=\"width: 727px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57152\" data-attachment-id=\"57152\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-22/sb-looks-for-alternatives-during-drought/cachuma/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cachuma.jpg?fit=3008%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3008,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Cachuma\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cachuma.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cachuma.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57152 \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cachuma-1024x680.jpg?resize=717%2C476\" alt=\"Lake Cachuma, the main reservoir that supplies Santa Barbara County.

There are many ways to make Cachuma more reliable that will be looked at as well.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said the water level of Lake Cachuma has reached its lowest point since the drought in the late 1980s.</p>\n<p>“I have watched with great concern as the lake level has been dropping over the last couple of years, and even though we’ve had rain, we haven’t had enough rain, clearly, to make up for the usage of the lake,” Farr said. “It used to take a lot longer for the lake to drop, even when we didn’t have a lot of rainfall. And now it’s really only been three and a half years or so since the lake was full and spilling.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Less than 10 percent of our regular water is from groundwater. There just isn’t a lot of capacity in our local area. We can only use a small fraction of this during the drought.” — Arturo Keller</p></blockquote>\n<p>Farr said rainfall is the only way to alleviate the drought situation.</p>\n<p>“They can only fill if there’s rain,” Farr said. “If it doesn’t rain, it doesn’t really matter how big your reservoir is, because there’s just no water to put into it.”</p>\n<p>Bren School Professor of Biogeochemistry Arturo Keller said a short-term supplemental water supply would involve bringing in water from the California State Projects, and a long-term solution may be to consider a desalination plant such as the Charles E. Meyer Desalination Plant downtown, which the City of Council of Santa Barbara recently reopened.</p>\n<p>“If we have another low rain year, we need to start on the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-16/sb-plans-to-restart-desalination-facility/\">desalination plant</a>, and also lease some water rights to have a reasonable level at Cachuma,” Keller said.</p>\n<p>According to Director Fayram, some cities such as Goleta and Carpinteria are turning to groundwater usage to make up for the shortages. In addition, Keller said groundwater supplies in Santa Barbara are insufficient to compensate for the drought conditions.</p>\n<p>“Less than 10 percent of our regular water is from groundwater,” Keller said. “There just isn’t a lot of capacity in our local area. We can only use a small fraction of this during the drought.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is currently in Stage Two drought conditions, indicating that a serious water shortage is expected, and drought-based water rates and mandatory water use restrictions may be implemented.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53762\" style=\"width: 373px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"530774379\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57151\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53762\" data-attachment-id=\"53762\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/governor-declares-california-drought-emergency/drought-photo-by-peter-mounteer/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer.jpg?fit=2189%2C1262&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2189,1262\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D80\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1390919753\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Drought photo by Peter Mounteer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer.jpg?fit=888%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-53762\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer-1024x590.jpg?resize=363%2C209\" alt=\"Pictured above is a dried-out marsh beside the Santa Ynez apartments.

City of Goleta Chief of Police Lt. Butch Arnoldi said residents of Goleta should limit parking space for the I.V. Halloween attendees to prevent similar disturbances.</p>\n<p>“I would encourage the residents to obtain the permits and park on the streets in front of your residence,” Arnoldi said. “Because, you know, if your car is parked there then an out of town visitor can’t park there, correct? So if you wanna protect your domain, put your vehicles in front of your house.”</p>\n<p>Twelve additional deputies and 100 police officers volunteered from other UC campuses to serve I.V. on Halloween weekend. The UCSB Police Department will have all of its members working on Halloween night with directed patrols taking place around Goleta businesses and hotels. Highway patrol will also establish driving under the influence checkpoints, K9 units and commercial units. Five extra ambulances staffed specifically for I.V. and four additional transport vans have been contributed by the Emergency Medical Response team. Additionally, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department will have an extra engine available.</p>\n<p>UCSB Police Department Sgt. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/question-authority-returns/\">Mark Signa</a> said the university bares many responsibilities towards the residents of I.V., particularly in light of the events of the past year.</p>\n<p>“There’s no doubt whatsoever that the impact of the events of last year in Isla Vista have affected not just Isla Vista but the community of Goleta as well,” Signa said. “The University of California has recognized that, and realized that we have a lot to do and a lot we need to do for the community, including the community of Goleta. It’s something that affects all of us.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_52786\" style=\"width: 636px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

“Meet Your Neighbors Day” was held throughout I.V. this past Saturday and drew hundreds of students and community members to various parks in the area.</p>\n<p>The event began with activities in nine neighborhood parks, featured free food from local businesses and provided attendees with information about safety and community-building in I.V. Attendees from each park then gathered at Anisq’Oyo’ Park around 4 p.m. for a gathering that showcased local bands and a DJ and allowed festival attendees to present flags representing their specific areas of I.V.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Parks District festival organizer Paola De La Cruz said the event was not exclusive to students and extended its reach to all I.V. residents.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“People have been brought together by seeing the community come together,” De La Cruz said. “There’s been a mix of family and students.”</p>\n<p>Monte-Angel Richardson, an I.V.

The two positions were vacated in early September by the resignations of former EVPLA, fourth-year sociology and Asian American studies double major Beatrice Contreras, and former SAG and third-year literature major Bailey Loverin.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for EVPLA or Student Advocate General requires the completion of at least 60 units accredited at UCSB by the end of Spring Quarter prior to the special election, including college-level transfer units, but excluding Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate units. Eligibility also requires fulfillment of at least six units while maintaining a 2.0 overall grade point average. An information session for interested individuals will be held at the A.S. Pardall Center today from 12-1 p.m. on Pardall Road in Isla Vista. Deadline candidacy forms were also made available online yesterday.</p>\n<p>Proposed plebiscites, new fees, referendums or fee increases can be submitted to the “fee intent form” found on the elections website and sent to elections@as.ucsb.edu by tomorrow, Oct. 15, at 4 p.m. In addition, pro/con statements will be due to the Elections Committee by Oct. 22 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Active campaigning for the Special Election will start Oct. 26 at 8 p.m. According to the announcement, the timeline is more condensed than that of the last year’s Spring general election and “diligence” with regard to deadlines and dates is mandated by the elections committee. The last time a special election was held on the UCSB campus was in 2006.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article has been updated to reflect the date and time of the info sessions occurring today, from 12-1 pm, for prospective candidates.]</p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56860\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56860\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/as-releases-special-election-information/","id":2984,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2983,2982,2981],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Train Collision Kills One, Injures Two","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Four individuals, three who were researching at UCSB as visiting scholars, were involved in a train collision Saturday evening on a bridge near Vista Point that left one woman dead and two other peopl...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>[<em>Update 10:41a.m.: </em>This article has updated with new details from the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.]</p>\n<p>Four individuals, three who were researching at UCSB as visiting scholars, were involved in a train collision Saturday evening on a bridge near Vista Point that left one woman dead and two other people injured.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman, Mike Eliason, the group was walking down the train train tracks around 6 pm taking pictures of the sunset when the train struck the group. Eliason also said the woman was struck and killed at the scene and that a male member of the group suffered severe injuries to the head and chest and was airlifted to the trauma center at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. A second female also suffered moderate injuries to the head and chest and was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital by ambulance.</p>\n<p>Eliason said that people who approach train tracks should use caution and minimize their time on the tracks because modern trains make less noise.</p>\n<p>“Trains these days are a lot more efficient and a lot quieter than they used to be,” Eliason said. “They can come up on you quickly and you might not realize it until its too late.”</p>\n<p>According to Eliason the train was traveling at track speed, between 50 and 60mph, when it approached the group and that the engineer sounded the horn upon seeing the group but was unable to stop the train in time.</p>\n<p>Due to privacy laws, the names of the three victims and the fourth group member who was a witness have not yet been released. According to Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, the Sheriff’s Office is working with the Chinese consulate and UCSB to notify the next of kin of the deceased.</p>\n<p>Vista Point is a popular turn out for California tourists along Highway 101 and is located approximately 20 miles northwest of campus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to Hertz, a friend’s invitation and the promise of “free stuff” brought him to the carnival.</p>\n<p>“It’s a fun environment,” Hertz said. “People are out here interacting where otherwise they’d be in their rooms, studying.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56821\" style=\"width: 369px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"358697386\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56823\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56821\" data-attachment-id=\"56821\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/pardall-carnival-brings-food-fun-games-and-community-gathering/christine-skari-pardall-carnival-banner/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?fit=1600%2C1010&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1010\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5200\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412905207\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christine Skari Pardall Carnival Banner\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?fit=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?fit=888%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56821\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner-1024x646.jpg?resize=359%2C226\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"359\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?resize=1024%2C646&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?resize=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56821\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Third-year microbiology and Japanese major Jonathan Tai helped tabled the Alpha Phi Omega booth during the carnival, and said that the carnival was a very positive atmosphere.</p>\n<p>“From my viewpoint the energy at the carnival was great.

After a brief introduction by the Fund for Santa Barbara Executive Director Geoff Green, attendees were split into three groups to discuss the most prominent self-governance models.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science and pyschology double major Cameron Schunk and recent alumnus and former A.S. President Jonathan Abboud discussed the option to form a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/self-governance-in-isla-vista-an-uncertain-future/\">Community Services District</a> (CSD), which would absorb the I.V. Recreation and Park District and County Service Area No. 31 and provide a number of services potentially funded through a utility users tax. Meanwhile, I.V. Recreation and Park District Board (IVRPD) member Pegeen Soutar and IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould presented their proposal for a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC), in which I.V. representatives would either be elected or appointed in order to make recommendations to county administrators that would serve I.V.’s best intrests. Lastly, State Assemblymember Das Williams covered the options to incorporate I.V. as a city, have it annexed by another nearby city and any other recommendations.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, although additional taxes may not be popular with everyone, they are the only way to afford essential services.</p>\n<p>“I think we need a government structure that has ‘T’ a.k.a. taxes. I know ‘taxes’ is always a scary word in America, but taxes are the only way we can pay for things together. I can’t buy a sidewalk, but the CSD can buy a sidewalk for everybody,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, the CSD would be led by a board of directors voted in by residents of the district, with each member coming from a different area in order to adequately represent everyone. He explained that managing a small community requires the help of people whose priorities lie in Isla Vista with its needs in mind.</p>\n<p>“A government that has general scope can be where people go to get funding, to get collaboration, to get support and I think that’s going to be the big engine that will be a way for a local government structure to support what people are doing in Isla Vista,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Doreen Farr, Third District Supervisor of Isla Vista, Santa Ynez and Goleta, a major concern of I.V. citizens is its infrastructure and amenities.</p>\n<p>“I hear about streetlights, I hear about sidewalks, I hear about deteriorating living conditions, and I always report those to the County. A lot of times, both the families that live here and the students are vulnerable as renters,” Farr said. “Sometimes they’re afraid to report things and so their living conditions sometimes deteriorates even more. So, we’re trying to figure out a way to assist with that as well.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-07/ucsb-alumnus-among-the-first-to-hack-google-glass/\">Jay Freeman</a>, a local business owner, community organizer and alumnus of the College of Creative Studies also known by his pseudonym “Saurik,” agreed with Farr but said residents need to have the ability to affect the community on a policy level in order to make a positive difference.</p>\n<p>“A lot of these issues that were brought up at the beginning of the meeting, things like renting, leasing and property owners and issues like those, can only be fixed if we have the ability to change the rules and change the laws that we operate under,” Freeman said. “All these things require rule changes.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said with this in mind, a CSD or MAC would not go far enough in offering citizens administrative control, arguing that cityhood is the best option.</p>\n<p>“The issues that I see with the Community Service District and the Municipal Advisory Council are that the Community Service District is not allowed to change the rules about how this area works,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Melvin Singh, A.S. External Vice President of State Wide Affairs and political science and film and media studies double major, said more community involvement is needed before Isla Vista can change for the better.</p>\n<p>“I think the problem is that when something happens in I.V., a lot of students don’t show up to county meetings. We need to get a lot more student input on the major decisions that happened here,” Singh said. “The biggest thing is having stronger local lobbying.”</p>\n<p>Singh also said past failures to establish self-governance resulted from the fact that students live in a transitory phase in which they are short-term residents of Isla Vista, and thus lack the long-term commitment to improving the community.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s why we haven’t really seen as much progress as I wish we could have, just because most of the people who live here only stay here for a few years and then move on,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>According to UC Police Department Lieutenant <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/question-authority-returns/\">Mark Signa</a>, despite the large range of differing opinions, the meeting was a success due to its display of increased involvement from residents.</p>\n<p>“What’s going on tonight is one of the benefits of having the community come together and realize that the problems of Isla Vista are just so vast and complex, and the community needs to come together and look at all the different options,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa said that although the Town Hall was not a solution in itself, the tragic events that took place last year have instilled a greater need for local participation in repairing Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“What I see is a starting point,” Signa said. “We have a long ways to go, but I think it’s a great opportunity for the community to come together. Isla Vista needs that right now. After last year, we definitely need to come together as a community.”</p>\n<p>After the presentations concluded, attendees were asked to vote on their first and second choices for self-governance options, with the CSD gaining a heavy majority followed by the MAC.</p>\n<p>Although Williams spoke about cityhood and annexation, he said he personally preferred either the CSD or MAC option, but said which one does not matter provided it represents a large majority of what I.V. residents want. Singh said the first step to progress is convincing opposing sides to work together and recognize that Isla Vista needs a collaborative effort in creating self-governance.</p>\n<p>“Nobody really knows who’s supposed to be responsible for what,” Singh said. “Everyone has their own interest, and it’s about finding a common ground and agreement. I’m sure students want one thing and property owners want something else.”</p>\n<p>Signa said the community must come together to fix its wounds and agree upon a solution that will provide long-term improvements, not only in terms of funding and services but also by maintaining a healthy communication between various groups such as students and law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important that the community come together and realize that those issues are here and we’ve got to come up with solutions that come from the community,” Signa said. “Law enforcement is just a band-aid.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/","id":3462,"author":{"id":170,"name":"Lannhu Khuat"},"related":[3461,3460,3459],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":137,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
