Yang during a May 2017 sit-in. Yang agreed to the demands but students are still concerned that the university has not taken enough action to reform sexual assault policies. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students at a town hall on Thursday continued to express their frustration with UC Santa Barbara administration, which they say has not fully addressed previously agreed-upon demands to reform sexual assault policies at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall, hosted by Student Activist Network, addressed one of the demands, which requires UC President Janet Napolitano to tour sexual assault and sexual violence town halls on UC campuses once a year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robin Holmes Sullivan, vice president for Student Affairs at the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), attended the town hall as a representative for Napolitano.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students initially presented the demands to Chancellor Henry T. Yang during at a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 2017 sit- in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These demands elaborated on a previous list of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nowUCsb13InitialDemandsforChancellorYang.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13 demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which students presented to Yang at a May 2015 sit-in in Cheadle Hall. In both cases, Yang agreed to the students’ demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel was composed of UCSB administrators, Title IX Student Advisory Board representative Jennifer Selvidge and Ro’Shawndra Earvin, who led the initial sit-in when Chancellor Yang signed the 2017 list of demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang did not attend the meeting because he was in Sacramento advocating for UC funding, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn explained at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said Yang had made a personal commitment to Earvin prior to the town hall that he would raise money for the Survivor Fund at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, Earvin posted on social media a screenshot of an email she had sent to Yang, in which she told the chancellor that he had been unresponsive to her emails. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It worries me that you have not consistently followed up with the issues presented to you on that day,” she wrote. ”I am sure you understand that directing me to your assistants is insufficient, as your name is on the contract as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said all of the demands from 2015 had been addressed. Some of the demands from last May are still in progress, like a demand for a Survivor Resource Center and an Isla Vista report card for sexual assault incidents, she said. She suggested partnering with a family justice center to address the former demand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Selvidge disagreed with Klawunn and said three of the original 13 demands have still not been met. Selvidge, who told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">she is a survivor of assault, read through the demands she considers incomplete.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the demands requires increasing female presence on the I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) and training all IVFP personnel to deal with sexual violence and harassment. Another states that there should be accountability and oversight of the Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA) for past mishandling of sexual assault cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still another of these demands requires placing an additional Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education Office (C.A.R.E.) advocate in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just need the university to run what they signed for,” Earvin said. “That’s the reason why I am here. Our agenda is ‘demand completion.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earvin also expressed frustration that her name had been used without her permission in an Associated Students (A.S.) Senate resolution. The resolution proposed using a mobile application called Sprigeo to combat sexual assault and sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Kristen Armellini and Grecia Martinez authored the resolution, which was presented at the Feb. 7 Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have never felt so disrespected,” Earvin said. “Apparently you had a story when you created the app, why did you use my story?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Feb. 7 meeting, UCSB alumna Alejandra Melgoza also expressed concern  because her name was mentioned in the resolution without her permission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Using my name without consent is perpetuating the same acts of violence,” Melgoza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Alexandra Gessesse and Andrea Reyes said the authors of the resolution should have approached the individuals before including their names. Gessesse said that regardless of when the resolution was written, the fact that Earvin and Melgoza had not been contacted was “exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earvin emphasized that her main initiative since the May sit-in was to fulfill the list of demands, including full payment of her UC tuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Run that tuition and run this resource center,” Earvin said. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

the UC Santa Barbara campus liasions for the advisory board. The board will advise the Title IX office on how to implement Title IX policies and procedures. <em>Maura Fox / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The advisory board met for the first time on Monday in Oakland, and attendees discussed prevention education, communication and outreach on campuses and what these policies look like now on all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Selvidge, a materials engineering graduate student was present at the meeting, but Tanaka, a fourth-year philosophy and sociology double major, was unable to attend.</p>\n<p>The board will advise the Title IX office on how to implement Title IX policies and procedures and will have “less input” on legal interpretation of the federal statute, according to Salvaty.</p>\n<p>System-wide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty told the <em>Nexus</em> that the<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\"> creation of the board</a> was proposed when she took office in Feb. 2017.</p>\n<p>“I know there’s been a lot going on at the UCSB campus, but what I want to make sure is that we have some sort of healthy and open line of communication to the people who actually control the policy, if it’s a system-wide policy issue,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Hieu Le, who was on the selection committee for the formation of the board, said the board looked for applicants who were actively working on sexual assault and sexual violence issues.</p>\n<p>“We were looking for candidates who … had the experience and also had the relationships already built in to be able to interface with these groups on the campus-based level and to be able to relay what our campus concerns are to the system wide efforts,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The board was asked to connect with their campus Title IX and Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) offices prior to the meeting. They were also told to solicit feedback from students on direct Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>According to Selvidge, she has been the head graduate student for nowUCSB, which is a sexual violence organization that’s entirely student-run and independent of the university.</p>\n<p>Selvidge said she spent a lot of time working on increasing awareness of domestic violence and dating, an issue which especially affects graduate students, many of whom are in long-term relationships.</p>\n<p>While at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate student, Selvidge said she was assaulted by a student and also harassed by a professor.</p>\n<p>“S.T.E.M. has a lot of sexual harassment and sexual assault that sort of gets swept under the rug, in part because it’s such a heavily male-dominated field,” she added. “I would like to see the expansion of the definitions of sexual assault and sexual harassment and especially dating violence and domestic violence because they’re currently exclusively related to force or threat of force.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge also hopes the board can talk to campus faculty and get them to understand that the concept of statute of limitations is concerning, especially when the state of California does not legally have a statute of limitations for sexual assault.</p>\n<p>As a queer-identifying individual, Selvidge believes the queer community has higher barriers in relation to assault reporting similar to the undocumented community, who may not feel safe reporting to the police, as “there’s all these nuanced issues with different communities,” she said.</p>\n<p>Selvidge is optimistic about the future of the board.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think we’ll get something out of it,” she said. “How big, how broad-reaching, how many ‘somethings,’ I don’t know yet.”</p>\n<p>Tanaka said that as an undergraduate, she hopes the Student Advisory Board will be a way for other undergraduates who have concerns about how the Title IX Office handles cases feel comfortable approaching the board with their concerns and feel heard.</p>\n<p>“My freshman year, I had a friend who confided in me about an assault, and I really didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know how to help her,” Tanaka said. “I went and talked to some people at C.A.P.S. asking, ‘What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to help her?’”</p>\n<p>Tanaka went on to do training with the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center and worked as an advocate for their crisis hotline, directly advising survivors.</p>\n<p>Last Winter Quarter, Tanaka interned with C.A.R.E. through the Violence Intervention and Prevention Program.</p>\n<p>“We set up a campaign in I.V. to help educate people who worked at alcohol-serving establishments to spread the right kind of ways to intervene in a situation that could be potentially dangerous, as far as sexual violence goes because we figured a lot of the times out here, alcohol is involved,” Tanaka said.</p>\n<p>The advisory board will be meeting again in April and will be holding a series of phone calls in between regarding specific policy issues.</p>\n<p>“I think in terms of system-wide policy issues, students at UCSB should use their student advisory board representatives as a way to communicate those concerns,” Salvaty said. “If it’s a campus-specific issue, I hope they bring those up, too because I think it might be more helpful to raise issues at a system-wide level and see if we can solve it as a system.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Feb. 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/","id":2324,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2323,2322,2321],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Naloxone Used in 9 Overdose Cases in SB County, 5 in I.V.

One incident resulted in a death and the second subject did not die, but also did not fully recover.</p>\n<p>SBSO worked with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and its Emergency Medical Services Agency last year to develop the Naloxone Program to combat the increasing number of overdoses in the county.</p>\n<p>Naloxone hydrochloride is the active ingredient in the prescription drug Narcan, a nasal spray that stops the effects of opioids, including extreme drowsiness, slowed breathing and loss of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Between 2011 and 2016, the Sheriff’s Coroner Unit observed a marked increase in overdose deaths. Opioids were present in approximately 65 percent of the overdose deaths that occurred in Santa Barbara County in 2016, according to the program press release.</p>\n<p>“Sheriff Brown, in conjunction with Dr. Gleghorn from SB County Behavioral Wellness recognized that opioid deaths were increasing throughout the country and that overall overdose deaths were increasing in SB County,” Bonner said in an email.</p>\n<p>SB County experienced 30 deaths due to all opioid-related overdoses in 2016, according to the most recent calendar year of data available.</p>\n<p>“At this point a number of initial first responder naloxone programs throughout the United States were showing significant promise in decreasing the number of people that die from opioid overdoses,” Bonner said.</p>\n<p>In October 2017, a 19-year-old male UC Santa Barbara student who was suffering from an apparent overdose in I.V. was administered naloxone and then transported to the hospital, the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/ucsb-student-hospitalized-after-apparent-overdose-police-administer-naloxone/\">reported</a>. Police found the student unconscious, but he survived the incident and woke up soon after the spray was administered.</p>\n<p>Police then administered naloxone to two other victims in I.V. in December, the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-29/two-apparent-overdoses-in-isla-vista-within-24-hours-victims-receive-doses-of-naloxone/\">reported</a>. The first victim was a 23-year-old male and the second was a 20-year-old man. In both cases, the victims were found struggling to breathe before police administered naloxone.</p>\n<p>In 2015, there were 7.7 opioid overdose deaths per 100,000 residents in SB County and 193 incidents of 911-emergency calls where Narcan was administered by first responders.</p>\n<p>The number of 911-emergency calls where a first responder used Narcan increased in 2016 to 260.</p>\n<p>According to an SBSO press release about the Naloxone Program, sheriff patrol personnel were trained to know when to give Naloxone to block the effects of opioids.</p>\n<p>According to the Narcan <a href=\"https://www.narcan.com/faqs\">website</a>, naloxone reverses the effects of opioid overdose in two to three minutes, which gives the opioid-poisoned person time for emergency medical help to arrive.</p>\n<p>According to Michelle Wehmer, the SB County Public Health Department epidemiologist, Narcan can be administered for several reasons, including when a first responder sees a subject not breathing and decides to administer the drug, during an accidental drug overdose due to confusion of being on several medications and recreational narcotics use such as snorting and ingestion.</p>\n<p>The amount of training an agency or staff person has received can affect the likelihood of a responder to administer Narcan. Naloxone is only effective for opioid drug overdoses.</p>\n<p>First responders do not always know which drugs the patient might have ingested, which makes training more helpful for deputies who are now administering the drug on duty.</p>\n<p>According to the Narcan<a href=\"https://www.narcan.com/faqs\"> website</a>, the nasal spray should be administered immediately and does not take the place of emergency medical care.</p>\n<p>It is advised that emergency medical help is sought right away after giving the first dose of Narcan even if the person wakes up because they may relapse into breathing difficulty.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Feb. 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

the Womxn’s Commission</em></p></div>\n<p>Womxn of color and their allies came together for this year’s Womxn of Color Conference on Saturday, Feb. 3, to discuss the issues minority womxn face with media representation, mental health and generational trauma.</p>\n<p>This year’s theme, “From Ashes to Activism: Rise through Resistance,” was reflected in the speakers, workshops and caucus spaces held throughout the day. The Associated Students Womxn’s Commission hosted the event.</p>\n<p>Ilene Ochoa, a fourth-year sociology major and senate liaison to the Womxn’s Commission, said the event was important for womxn of color in the present political climate.</p>\n<p>“The board liked the idea of rising from the ashes, being reborn like a phoenix, because even though you’ve gone through hardships, you still come out strong,” Ochoa said in an email.</p>\n<p>Zahira Kelly-Cabrera, an Afro-Dominicana writer, artist and international speaker, kicked off the event with a compelling speech about being an Afro-Latina.</p>\n<p>Kelly-Cabrera talked about her struggles with self-identity and with being marginalized even within her own Latinx community. She told a story of resilience amidst the hate she received from individuals who disapproved of her voicing self-acceptance as a womxn of color.</p>\n<p>She also discussed self-growth and resistance despite her experiences of toxic relationships and feeling like she did not belong to any community.</p>\n<p>Many attendees considered the speaker a highlight of the conference.</p>\n<p>“I enjoyed the keynote speaker [because] the space was intimate and powerful when she was sharing her story,” Ochoa said.</p>\n<p>Two workshop sessions succeeded Kelly-Cabrera.</p>\n<p>Sessions A and B featured various workshops focusing on topics such as mental health healing and effectively using radio as a platform for womxn of color to make their voices heard.</p>\n<p>Deborah Williams, a second-year political science major, attended a workshop called “Revolutionary Motherhood And Growing Up In The Movement: Two Generations Of Transnational Feminists.”</p>\n<p>“I got a better understanding of women’s roles and how they are changing today and how my mothers and grandmothers role differ from how I’m going to pursue my role as a mother,” Williams said. “I am going to foster that new generation with male and female equality.”</p>\n<p>KCSB-FM’s Radio Xicana host, Cecilia, lead the workshop called “Navigating the AirWaves: Muxeres en Radio.”</p>\n<p>She said her passion for the workshop stemmed from exploring the construct of identity through a more authentic platform in comparison to media representation.</p>\n<p>Hour-long caucus spaces, which are safe spaces for different identifications to bond over shared experiences, followed the sessions.</p>\n<p>Adena Badawi, an attendee from Orange County, explained the importance behind the caucuses.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s really important for womxn of color to have an outlet where we can all come together and share our experiences and form connections, and I’ve definitely accomplished that today through all the great people like me that I’ve met,” said Badawi.</p>\n<p>Attendees expanded on why the Womxn of Color Conference plays a key role in the fight for equality.</p>\n<p>Williams added that it was vital for college campuses to raise awareness and encourage participation in events such as this.</p>\n<p>“I think by coming to these conferences, I’m able to see more people like myself and relate to their experiences,” Samantha Mejia, a second-year sociology major, said.</p>\n<p>Maria Gonzales, a second-year global studies major, discussed the role that the Womxn of Color Conference plays on campus.</p>\n<p>Gonzales explained that UCSB has a lack of safe spaces for students of color on campus and said students of color often do not feel a sense of belonging in higher institutions.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of attendees were minority womxn, a few allies attended in order to show their support, get educated and gain perspective.</p>\n<p>“Men don’t support womxn very well so I feel like I need to step up and be an example to other men, and I need to learn how to do that properly,” Fred Atef, a visitor from Orange County, said.</p>\n<p>The Womxn’s Commission considered the day as a success, and Ochoa said that the event re-motivated her to continue her work as a political activism.</p>\n<p>“I see how important this work is in our community and how it can empower other womxn of color,” Ochoa said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In his writing, Rodger bemoans his “inability to find a girlfriend,” condemns interracial couples and laments that a black man — “descended from slaves” — can “get a white girl,” while he cannot.</p>\n<p>On May 23, 2014, Rodger, then a second-year student at Santa Barbara City College, stabbed three of his housemates before driving through Isla Vista and opening fire on street-goers. In the years since, he has become an internet meme on alt-right forums. Posters frequently invoke his memory to highlight misogynistic, anti-feminist ideology.</p>\n<p>Rodger’s link to Nazi ideology was established as early as Feb. 2015 when the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) released its full report on Rodger’s killing spree. Rodger searched the internet for phrases like “Adolf Hitler and the law of attraction,” “Nazi curbstomp” and “Holocaust of black people,” the <em>Nexus</em> <a

Spencer coined the phrase “alt-right” as far back as 2008, but since the turn of the decade, the ideology has gained prominence, especially with the rise of meme culture and a surge in far-right sympathies in global politics.</p>\n<p>In all, the SPLC listed 13 alt-right killers, including Dylann Roof, who in 2015 killed nine people in a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Barbara’s Dance Marathon (UCSBDM) will be holding its annual GauchoThon event on Feb. 10 in the Rob Gym, which will benefit the Neo-Natal and Pediatric Intensive Care Units at Santa Barbara’s Cottage Children’s Medical Center.</p>\n<p>Check in will begin at 11:30 a.m. and the event officially starts at noon.</p>\n<p>“GauchoThon is kind of like a jog-a-thon, but a dance-a-thon instead,” Zareena Zaidi, director of entertainment and co-director of marketing for the Dance Marathon at UCSB, in an email. “It’s just about having fun and supporting the kids.”</p>\n<p>According to Zaidi, the main idea of GauchoThon is simply to “stand for the kids who can’t.” Various UCSB groups are brought in to perform, play games and do other activities to entertain participants throughout the twelve-hour event.</p>\n<p>“We have kids — who are alive today because of the care they received from the hospital — come and tell their story, which I think is really impactful,” Zaidi said.</p>\n<p>“Miracle Childs,” or those who have received life-saving treatment at CCMC, will be at the event to share their stories and possibly dance with students. Zaidi believes that having the “Miracle Childs” in attendance helps connect participants with the cause and highlight how their fundraising is helping CCMC.</p>\n<p>CCMC hosts numerous fundraising events throughout the year, with GauchoThon being the finale of their year-long efforts and a celebration of the kids and the participants who fundraise.</p>\n<p>Ann Peyrat, liaison with CCMC, explained that the Dance Marathon at UCSB “provides a place for students to ‘belong’” while also benefiting other nonprofits on campus by “giving them a tabling opportunity to spotlight their mission.”</p>\n<p>Peyrat also explained that UCSB students volunteer countless hours for the cause.</p>\n<p>“UCSBDM members ‘table’ on campus, visit classrooms, residence halls, clubs and Greek life and host events. They take on leadership roles, form committees, hold weekly meetings and coordinate everything from catering, sponsorship, marketing, social media, entertainment, performances and visits from now healthy CCMC patients,” she said.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, UCSBDM and GauchoThon have raised over $60,000 to support Cottage Hospital’s Neo-Natal and Pediatric Intensive Care Units.</p>\n<p>Zaidi said that there is no fundraising goal for this year, “just to raise as much as [they] possibly can.”</p>\n<p>Individual entry for the event requires a $5 donation to CCMC and registration information can be found on the events’ Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Even if students can’t make it out to this year’s event, there are still ways to donate and get involved. Donations will remain open until March and can be submitted on the events’ Facebook page. Registration for next year’s event will open up as early as Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>“[UCSBDM students] are this generation fighting for the next. We couldn’t be more honored to have the support of Dance Marathon at UCSB,” Peyrat said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

of what is considered to be a normal amount of rainfall for this time. The Cachuma Reservoir received only 42 percent of the typical amount, and Santa Barbara County altogether received 25 percent of normal rainfall.</p>\n<p>In addition to decreased rainfall, the report showed impacts on water quality in the reservoir due to the fires. Due to the most recent rain event on Jan. 9, the reservoir received 500 acre-feet of inflow. It is unknown how much of this inflow was composed of ash or mud.</p>\n<p>According to Kelley Dyer, water supply manager for the City of Santa Barbara, the inflow to the reservoir can be treated, but it takes about three weeks for the sediment, including ash and mud, to settle out, so the county has been pulling from other sources.</p>\n<p>The impact of the Thomas, Whittier and Rey Fires on water quality and supply of the Cachuma, Gibraltar, and State water supply “will last for years,” Dyer said.</p>\n<p>This year “has been one of the driest on record, just a bit better than the 2014-2015 year,” which was the worst to date, Santa Barbara City Councilmember Eric Friedman said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“We’re taking this seriously and looking ahead … We were one of two counties that were not out of the drought last year while the rest of the state was,” he added.</p>\n<p>The report showed the impact of rainfall from Sep. 1, 2017, to Jan. 29, 2018 in Santa Barbara, as well as the county’s two main sources for water supply.</p>\n<p>“Rainfall, as you may expect, is very low,” said Joshua Haggmark, a water resources manager for the City of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Due to the recent fires and lack of rain, the water supply is diminished from previous years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80836\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"962128473\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80834\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80836\" data-attachment-id=\"80836\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-06/santa-barbara-county-continues-to-experience-severe-drought/charred-hillside-noozhawk-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?fit=1000%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80836\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Noozhawk</em></p></div>\n<p>This is a significant change from the report of rainfall during this time last year.</p>\n<p>From Dec. 10, 2016, to Jan. 23, 2017, the impact of of rainfall was much higher in Santa Barbara County and its sources of water. The Gibraltar Reservoir received 133 percent of the expected amount of rainfall, and the Cachuma Reservoir received 147 percent of normal rainfall. Santa Barbara County received 163 percent of typical rainfall for that time of year.</p>\n<p>Dyer explained that when the Cachuma Reservoir stops spilling is when it is clear that Santa Barbara County is entering a drought. A reservoir “spills” when it has reached higher than 100 percent capacity, so the excess water goes through a spillway connecting to the local creeks and waterways.</p>\n<p>She said that the last time Cachuma spilled was in 2011.</p>\n<p>A drought was declared in Santa Barbara County in 2014, with drought conditions growing worse since then, according to the City Council report.</p>\n<p>The council predicts the water shortage to extend into 2020, according to a diagram shown during the meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Department of Public Health’s Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses Weekly Report for Jan. 7 to 13, 2018 reported that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses are more widespread  this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Influenza A (H3N2) strain tends to cause larger outbreaks compared to other strains of the flu, according to data from the Center for Disease Control and Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ali Javanbakht, the medical director at UCSB Student Health, said Cottage Hospital in Goleta has seen a sharp rise in the number of flu cases. Other hospitals in counties across California are experiencing elevated numbers of cases as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least 20,000 people die in the U.S. from the flu every year, according to Javanbakht. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As of now, improving flu vaccination rates is our best bet at reducing that number,” Javanbakht said in an email. “We’re always looking for ways to boost flu vaccination rates at UCSB since there are a lot of people on campus in close quarters, which can really lend itself to an outbreak.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between Aug. 1, 2017 and Jan. 23, 2018, UCSB Student Health administered 1,862 flu vaccines. In the same time period last year, UCSB Student Health had administered 1,794  vaccinations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help boost these rates, UCSB Student Health offers flu vaccination clinics. Their walk-in hours are Monday through Friday, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. An express flu clinic is also available by appointment and is held on Friday afternoons from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The California Department of Public Health said vaccinating is the best protection against the influenza virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s hard for young, healthy college students to feel the need to get the flu vaccine, but getting a flu vaccine yourself helps protect your ‘tribe’ Javanbakht said in an email. “By getting vaccinated, you become one fewer entry points of the flu virus into your circle of friends, roommates, classmates, significant others, and family members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There would be a drastic decrease in the number of flu cases if 95 percent of the campus were vaccinated, according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This would mean fewer missed class days, fewer missed exercise days, fewer missed socializing days, and more healthcare resources available to tend to other ill or injured students,” he said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is still possible to catch the flu if a person receives the flu vaccine, Javanbakht said those who are vaccinated and fall ill tend to be ill for a shorter amount of time and experience less extreme symptoms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht reported that the majority of the flu cases UCSB Student Health sees are in students who haven’t received the vaccine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to wash hands often, cover coughs and sneezes and stay home when sick in order to stop the spread of the flu. Javanbakht also said using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands is effective, especially before eating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taking care when touching surfaces where the flu virus can reside, such as doorknobs, tables, pens, paper, ATM, keyboards, etc., and using a hand sanitizer after doing so can also be very effective,” Javanbakht said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that “getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals and exercising regularly all help to keep the immune system functioning better overall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/","id":2760,"author":{"id":208,"name":"Rachael Grand"},"related":[2759,2758,2757],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

mental illness during the Feb. 2 meeting. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate held a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee on Feb. 2 in response to the resolution passed on Jan. 24 in support of mentally disabled students in on-campus housing.</p>\n<p>The meeting was held by Senators Alison Sir and Anthony Pimentel and concluded with a plan to continue the discussion with university administrators and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.)</p>\n<p>Sir read off an anonymous testimony from a student who removed from university housing due to a mental disability.</p>\n<p>“When I met with Housing and Judicial Affairs, they said I was banned because I violated the Personal Care Clause and my agreement, even though it was due to my mental illness,” Sir read from the testimony.</p>\n<p>The meeting began with a public forum to allow students of the UC Santa Barbara community to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“I know a lot of people who have had to go to Tropicana because of this clause and I’m here to say that as a personal representative of the RHA Coordinating Board, I’m just here to support you guys,” said Kevin Sabellico, San Rafael Hall Council Co-President.</p>\n<p>Daniel Renteria, Chair of the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), added that he needs to “make sure this is an appropriate goal for IVTU to be a part of.”</p>\n<p>In the approved plan of action, senators will split into three groups to collect information regarding the “Personal Care Clause” to present at a Town Hall meeting with the UCSB community in two weeks, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Three senators will meet with Housing and Residential Services, a second group will meet with C.A.P.S., and a third group will meet with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80789\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80789\"

referencing to the vague justifications used to remove students from Housing.</p>\n<p>During their meeting with C.A.P.S., the senators plan to discuss the training provided to Residential Life staff on handling mental health issues and C.A.P.S.’s role in helping students who may struggle with mental illness, according to Sir.</p>\n<p>The council also plans to gather and release testimonies from students who attend C.A.P.S. for review and potential policy changes.</p>\n<p>Sir clarified that their intentions are not to discourage students from using C.A.P.S., calling it a “great student resource” that simply needs improvement.</p>\n<p>Pimentel said Senators speaking with administration plan to gather information on UCSB’s involvement in dealing with these issues.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a very productive and efficient meeting that allowed Alison and myself to hear the public’s thoughts and perspectives about this issue and allowed us to direct the Committee members onto the plan of action to combat the poorly written Personal Care clause,” Pimentel said.</p>\n<p>Pimentel encourages all students to attend the future Town Hall meeting. The location and date of the next Town Hall meeting has yet to be determined.</p>\n<p>Future meetings will be held with voting senators to maintain student anonymity.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Sabellico

They should look forward to learning about different issues that they aren’t familiar with,” Arias said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caucus spaces will succeed the workshops and serve as a time to debrief and intermingle with individuals of shared identities, according to Arias.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many workshops are open to all, but some spaces specify the identifications they are open to. The Womxn of Color Conference website explains the status of each event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Womxns’ Commission reminds interested individuals to register online to ensure plenty of food and t-shirts for everyone. Attendees will be provided breakfast, lunch and dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am passionate about creating spaces for people to learn, grow, and feel safe.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 40 people marched with signs outside of the UCSB Library and the Arbor, chanting “UC, UC, you’re no good; treat your workers like you should.” The protest was held first between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and later from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday’s picket line was held to show “solidarity” with the union’s bargaining team as it works toward reaching an agreement on issues like UC overstaffing and emergency layoffs, according to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Groundskeeper lead Juan Donato has worked at UCSB for seven years and joined Thursday’s protest because it is “symbolic” of the 50th anniversary of the death of two sanitation workers, who were killed on the job after their truck’s compactor malfunctioned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We deserve, we matter and we deserve to be treated with respect and dignity,” he said. “[It’s] interesting for me 50 years of fighting and [we’re] still in the fight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident prompted a strike in Memphis, which drew approximately 1,300 workers, according to the AFSCME website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workers’ deaths “inspired Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to join in marching against poor pay and unsafe working conditions,” UCSB Student Health Medical Assistant Babe Gonzales said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzales has worked at UCSB for 28 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is about equality, security, dignity and fairness with all UC workers. What we want is protection for women, immigrants and people of color,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the workers protesting today want wages that increase with inflation, affordable health care, secure retirement and an end to the outsourcing of jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hijinio Camacho, known around UCSB and Isla Vista as “The Elotero,” also worked at the protest by serving food alongside AFSCME workers to those who were picketing.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80758\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1038365017\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80759\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80758\" data-attachment-id=\"80758\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/union-workers-march-in-remembrance-hold-picket-line-for-workers-rights/2016x1134-jpeg-804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed-large/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,540\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2016×1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80758\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hijinio Camacho served food alongside AFSCME during the picket line. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/high-insurance-costs-prevent-el-elotero-from-selling-on-campus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made the decision</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not to hold fundraisers on UCSB’s campus because he cannot afford the high insurance costs required of campus vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We represent cooks, custodians, groundskeepers, so we’re right now trying to send a message to management saying that this is about equality, this is about fairness,” AFSCME organizer Mercedes Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want [the UC] to treat them right, and that’s why we have to do this,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Kile, a fifth-year chemistry major and AFSCME intern, explained that he joined the protest today because of his father, who passed away from pancreatic cancer before Kile started his senior year of high school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that his father worked two jobs, one at U.P.S. and one working full time at California Lutheran University.

Until then, the project would require a $20 increase per student per quarter.</p>\n<p>“That’s a 48 million dollar project, as I mentioned, and I think it’s a lot to ask from students to pay for the majority of that cost,” Ferraro said. “A lot of students have a very tough financial burden, and every dollar really counts for them.”</p>\n<p>Le declined the <em>Nexus’</em> request for comment, but spoke to the Senate later and confirmed the potential costs of the new project for students.</p>\n<p>He said the project has a $48 million budget which would be funded through a combination of student fees and fundraising, and that the fees would range from $21 to $99 per quarter. The project, however, is still in its preliminary stages; Le will need to collect signatures to get the measure on the ballot for the 2018 A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>He said the plan would include an approximately $50 million return for students with financial aid to supplement the fee for students who could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p>Ferraro explained that the current proposal doesn’t include any financial commitment from the university aside from setting up a fundraiser that would solicit funds from alumni donors.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of you really opposed when the UC Regents or when [the] university is really trying to raise our fees and you guys really fight and you’re great leaders on that,” Ferraro said to the senators.</p>\n<p>“But I think when it comes to this and when it comes to internal funding, I think you really have to be careful and really pay attention to what they’re asking for, especially Office of the President,” he added.</p>\n<p>The original resolution references a 2012 space survey which states that “38% of A.S. entities has no assigned space, while a quarter of A.S. entities used temporary or shared spaces. A.S. is located in seven different buildings on campus making it difficult for students to collaborate and integrate their ideas, projects, and communications.”</p>\n<p>The resolution proposed the expansion and renovation of the UCen because it is nearly $2 million in debt and the majority of the businesses are not successful. It also states that the interior and exterior need to be remodeled for general aesthetics “in order to have a comparative advantage over other elite universities.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also references the UCSB Long Range Development Plan 2025, which calls for an annual one percent growth of students until UCSB reaches a capacity of 25,000 students.</p>\n<p>Le created a task force to revisit the Student Union Revitalization Fund (S.U.R.F.), which had been originally created by previous A.S. president Jonathan Abboud in 2013, according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The S.U.R.F. proposal received approval from the Campus Planning Community, Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fischer, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young, Chancellor Henry Yang and A.S. when it was first proposed in 2014.</p>\n<p>Le’s task force would assess the “internal needs” of A.S. and update the S.U.R.F. proposal. The updated plan provides 40 percent more program area than the previous concept and “[addresses] critical building infrastructure needs of the UCen.”</p>\n<p>Proposed spaces that would also be refined would include the A.S. Bike Shop, the A.S. Food Bank relocation and expansions, A.S. Senate Chambers, A.S. Recycling Center relocation, A.S. office improvements and an Environmental Sustainability Resource Center.</p>\n<p>The original resolution states that Senate stands in “full support” of Le’s project and described the project as “well-needed” and “long-overdue.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ferraro was mistakenly named as a San Miguel Hall Council Member. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to the resolution, numerous students have been removed from housing due to their mental disabilities. The resolution reads that disability discrimination is “an issue that constantly looms over UCSB students” and calls for the alteration or removal of the “Personal Care” clause in the UCSB housing contract.</p>\n<p>The “Personal Care Clause,” located under the Personal Care section of the housing contract, states that “residents are responsible for their own self-care and personal needs.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB Residential and Community living claims to ‘value diversity and inclusivity,’ but actively removes/refuses students who are neuroatypical without alternative housing options, contributing to disability discrimination within housing, student housing insecurity, and poor mental health,” the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>The resolution was authored by Senator Alison Sir and Senator Anthony Pimentel and was developed and finalized on Jan. 23, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>“I felt a resolution was the most efficient solution to make a plan of action by creating a committee and working on this issue head on,” Sir said.</p>\n<p>She added that the students who brought the issue to her attention would like to remain anonymous due to the “extremity and sensitivity of this particular issue.”</p>\n<p>Pimentel said that the issue was first brought to Sir and she asked him to be the co-author. Students with a mental disability are part of a community that is oftentimes “overlooked,” Pimentel said.</p>\n<p>“When this type of mistreatment to a community occurs, I find it necessary and critical that, as a student leader, I do all that I can to hold the people responsible for their mistreatment to a community of students who need the most support,” he said.</p>\n<p>The resolution states that the “personal care” clause should be eliminated and a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities should be created.</p>\n<p>The Senate demands that UCSB Housing include a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities because “citing C.A.P.S. is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB Housing contract states that Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through 805-893-4411.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the contract states that C.A.P.S. offers a large range of services, including crisis intervention, individual and group counseling, psychological assessment, stress management and referrals to outside agencies.</p>\n<p>The Senate resolution, however, states that C.A.P.S. is prevented from “being an adequate source of relief for students with short- and long-term mental illnesses” because only a limited number of appointments can be provided for each student.</p>\n<p>The resolution adds that C.A.P.S. is “severely understaffed.”</p>\n<p>Sir said she and Pimentel are currently planning to have a meeting with C.A.P.S. to discuss the program and the concerns outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The clause “provides much gray area for Housing and Residential Services to work with in illegally excluding mentally ill students from UCSB Housing,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Currently, it is “considered reasonable” for UCSB Housing to remove or reject individuals who have a history of mental instability and who are not currently being treated to “mitigate the mental instability,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>On-campus housing is held to different standards than other landlord-tenant relationships as a government community-based housing entity.</p>\n<p>Pimentel and Sir will be holding a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee Feb. 2 in the Nati conference room from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. to discuss a plan combatting the Personal Care Clause, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Interested students and the general public are invited to attend to share their own experiences or voice their opinions on this issue, Pimentel said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
