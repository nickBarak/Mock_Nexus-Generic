labor practice charge, filed by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) 3229, alleges that the University of California attempted to stifle the union’s “ability to strike, to silence its voice, and to diminish its ranks,” according to the document submitted to the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PERB is the government agency responsible for regulating the bargaining statuses for public schools, universities, public employees and other government employees, according to the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.perb.ca.gov\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charge claims that UC violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act, which protects UC workers’ rights to unionize and allows collective bargaining to negotiate their own wages, benefits and working conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a systemic pattern of intimidation and creating an atmosphere of fear in the workplace,” AFSCME spokesperson John de los Angeles said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the most recent incidents happened during the UC campus-wide union strike on March 20, during which workers received citations from police, a consequence of protesting that workers had not previously experienced from UC, said de los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The workers] were hitting the picket line, making noise, but they always do and all of a sudden UCPD is now threatening them with police citations,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For them to change that expectation…  [creates] a sense of hesitance for some of our workers to come forward, voice concerns and even participate in these activities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The filing lists examples of UC’s alleged failure to protect workers’ rights to protest, such as “workplace retaliation and police citation” and “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">condoning the violent physical assault of striking workers on the picket line.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The filing goes into specific details about incidents in which UC workers experienced violence, threats of arrest and discouragement from protesting. The filing also listed incidents where UC management offered rewards to workers not participating in strikes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the incidents included a UC Davis supervisor’s </span><a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2019/01/11/video-shows-alleged-uc-davis-employee-attack-afscme-3299-strikers-in-october/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attack</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on AFSCME strikers in Oct. 2018, UC Labor Relations misleading and intimidating communications to union employees and UC Police at UCSB and UC Los Angeles threatening workers with citations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These incidents and others surrounding the UC campus-wide protest on March 20 are a sign of the university’s attempt to subvert union efforts, de los Angeles said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But these actions have a greater toll on union workers that just stifling protests, he added.</span></p>\n<p>“When the university is allowed to engage in these activities without consequences, the ultimate effect is actually a violation of workers’ rights and these are rights that are protected by state law,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re merely drawing attention to the fact that the university is openly and blatantly violating state law.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME’s recent strikes are part of a now three-year negotiation with UC for higher wages and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But UC has remained steadfast in its position on “AFSCME’s unreasonable demands for wage increases,</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Doan, spokesperson and director of media relations for UC, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want raises that are nearly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">triple</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> those given to other UC employees,” Doan said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope AFSCME leaders will channel more time and effort into actual bargaining.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of March 27, the UC had not received a copy of the charges and could not comment on them or determine whether there was “any merit to these allegations,” Doan said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME leadership announced Friday that another strike will be taking place on April 10 in protest against UC’s conduct referred to in the suit.</span></p>\n<p>A copy of the filing in full can be read below: <object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-0325-Unfair-Practice-Charge-w-Exhs.-A-J-Redacted.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-0325-Unfair-Practice-Charge-w-Exhs.-A-J-Redacted.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

AFSCME has gone on strike three times during this period, aiming to get better pay and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UPTE initiated the call for Wednesday’s strike; AFSCME, as well as several United Automobile Workers 5810 (UAW) members, later joined in solidarity and support of their shared interests regarding the result of UPTE’s ongoing contract negotiations with the University of California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal is to have the university recognize how important it is to us, where we’ll take a day without pay to try and get these fair wages and maintain our healthcare plan,” said Michael Holford, a member of UPTE who also works in UCSB’s Communication Services department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the strike, union workers made beelines around campus – from Henley Gate to Cheadle Hall – in a demand for better treatment by the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babe Gonzalez, a representative for AFSCME 3229 and a Student Health employee, said the UC’s current offer to employees does not accommodate workers’ needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC is wanting to give us a lump sum of money in exchange for job security, in exchange for outsourcing jobs,” Gonzalez said, noting the UC’s lack of attention to what she believes union workers really need: “We need our job to continue. We don’t need a lump sum of money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another concern voiced through the microphones involved livable wages. Jarrod Coldron, an AFSCME representative, former UCSB student and present-day groundskeeper at the university, said he is fearful that the cost of living in Isla Vista might force him out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really like my job here, but it’s really expensive to live in Isla Vista, and if I don’t have a good contract, I won’t be able to afford to live here as long as I want to,” Coldron said. “I’m just trying to keep this affordable for me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the only groundskeeper currently residing in I.V., Coldron explained that his coworkers often commute from other areas in the county to work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I’m the only groundskeeper on campus that lives in l.V. Everybody else is in Lompoc or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carpentaria. A lot of people live far away and bus in,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to UCOP representative Claire Doan, the UC finds that UPTE is asking too much from the institution and has been unreasonable with their demands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are disappointed with UPTE leadership, demanding unreasonable double-digit raises (16 to 22 percent over the proposed terms of the agreement) that are far beyond those given to other UC employees. Since negotiations began in 2017, our offers have been fair and substantial, guaranteeing competitive wage increases and excellent benefits,” Doan said in an email with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Meanwhile, UPTE leaders have neither presented a realistic counteroffer, nor have they let their members vote on UC’s proposals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said she believes the UC’s resistance to forming a better contract is derived from a poor understanding of the situation. At a university, Gonzalez said that a vital function of the workplace is “to make sure that they are respectful of their members,” which includes students at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC doesn’t seem to realize how important we are. We are the first contact when a student comes to the Health Center, when they’re having someone clean their dorms … They don’t go to the offices to see people. They don’t know who they are, they know who we are, and they know that we care,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary Colmenar, a librarian at UCSB, offered a similar sentiment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really important for us to tell the administration that we’re the people who actually work and run the university,” Colmenar said, who also noted a dry spell in contracts for the library’s worker union, University of California American Federation of Teachers (UC-AFT), which has dragged on for over six months.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86998\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/labor-strike_devin-ralston_online-7/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-86998\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86998\" data-attachment-id=\"86998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/labor-strike_devin-ralston_online-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Labor Strike_Devin Ralston_ONLINE (7)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86998\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the day, waves of union employees marched through campus with chants, aiming to not only build energy, but also to voice their complaints.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At noon, multiple speakers spoke at a rally for the workers, all of whom funneled the sentiments of those chants into the messages of their speeches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Oscar Soto, a graduate student at UCSB, took the stage, he turned the microphone to the crowd and began to ask them questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the question: “How many of you are undergrads?” many students raised their hands.

It is to admire the heroics of some of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives to save others.”</p>\n<p>Professor Butch Ware, who teaches African history and the history of Islam at UCSB, began his speech by saying that the “topic of today’s brief address is love.”</p>\n<p>“Only love is capable of conquering hate, and the reminder comes from the Quran, the book brought by the Prophet Mohammad believed by Muslims to be God’s verbatim speech,” Ware said.</p>\n<p>“What kind of sense does it make for beings made of dirt to rank one another hierarchically above other beings made of dirt?” he asked. “The Quran reminds us over and over again that we were brought out of this earth and will be put back into it … White supremacy is the greatest historical expression of Satan’s own religion.”</p>\n<p>Ware emphasized that although Islam is mocked as a religion of violence, it is, in fact, a religion of love and peace.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“We need to counter the white supremacist ideology that fueled this horrible attack… No excuses and no tolerance can be given to white supremacy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later in the vigil, 51 attendees lined up on either side of Storke Tower, each holding a white rose. As each victim’s name was read, each rose was placed in a vase in the center, for a total of 51 white roses.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, who spoke following the victims’ names being called, noted that this May marks five years since the 2014 tragedy in Isla Vista, when six people were killed.</p>\n<p>“As a community that knows the profound impact of hate armed with guns, we at UCSB also know how important it is to stand with and for each other at moments when hate threatens — whether it is sexism as it was in Isla Vista in 2014 or Islamophobia as it is today, we need to speak up and speak out against intolerance,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>“We need to counter the white supremacist ideology that fueled this horrible attack,” she added. “No excuses and no tolerance can be given to white supremacy and we are seeing the danger in allowing even its smallest manifestations to pass.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn also referenced a call for gun control, which drew applause from the crowd. She said she hopes the United States follows the steps that New Zealand is taking “so that it will not be so easy for those who want to commit terrorism in the name of hate to get weapons.”</p>\n<p>“This hurts,” Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said. “I’m grieving … as a mom to 23,000 students, as a colleague, as someone who has Muslim friends.

Not a lot of people know, ‘How do Muslims grieve when a person passes away?’ ”</p>\n<p>She and the other organizers made it a point to incorporate aspects of Islamic funeral rituals, both with a Janazah prayer and by having an active member of the MSA’s mosque read Qur’an verses and perform a du’a.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86962\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-18/in-photos-msa-hosts-vigil-in-solidarity-with-muslims-of-new-zealand/nzmemorial-03182019-angiebanks-23/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-86962\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86962\" data-attachment-id=\"86962\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-18/in-photos-msa-hosts-vigil-in-solidarity-with-muslims-of-new-zealand/nzmemorial-03182019-angiebanks-23/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86962\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86962\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The vigil ended with a Janazah prayer and a silent march to the MultiCultural Center. <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The vigil itself came together in a mere 72 hours.</p>\n<p>When the MSA first learned about the attack, members were outraged, Faiz said.</p>\n<p>“We had to really calm everyone down and be like, ‘Hey, guys, I know that all of your anger is justified, but being angry isn’t gonna solve anything. We need to do something that honors the victims, not focus on the shooter,’” she said.</p>\n<p>Rabie was the one who first introduced the idea of the vigil, although Faiz was worried that the turnout would be low, given it was finals week.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the weekend, the students met up to sketch out the agenda for the vigil and write their speeches.</p>\n<p>Faiz said she initially didn’t realize how much she was grieving: “The weird thing about grieving is that you don’t realize you’re a little off until after you get better, ‘cause that’s when you realize, ‘Oh, this is how better feels.’ ”</p>\n<p>“[On Thursday], it was kind of like feeling numb, like the grief hasn’t completely hit yet,” she said.</p>\n<p>Later that night, as the stories began pouring out about the lives of the victims, and as she read up on them, “that’s what really brought out the grief.”</p>\n<p>“Seeing how each person kind of has an emotional aspect or a loved one or a story, that’s what you start to relate with. That’s what really starts making you cry.”</p>\n<p>The vigil today operated as sort of the “last part of our healing,” Faiz said.</p>\n<p>“We were able to feel good and see all that positivity. That kind of washes away all the fear and sadness.”</p>\n<p>As she put together the list of people who died in Christchurch, Faiz said it was then she realized just how many lives were lost.</p>\n<p>“If we just said ‘51 people passed away,’ you don’t really understand the magnitude of it. But when you read each name out and realize how long the list is going, that’s … when you realize, ‘Wow, this is so many people and stories.’ ”</p>\n<p>Faiz said the support the UCSB community has given her and the other students was “overwhelming.”</p>\n<p>As they worked to organize the vigil, Faiz said the administration was more than willing to help the event come together.</p>\n<p>Klawunn, in particular, reached out to Faiz even before MSA had contacted UCSB administration, saying that she was thinking of the MSA after hearing about the attack.</p>\n<p>“The fact that it’s not just that I have to notify them, but they’re already aware of it and reaching out to me, that meant a lot to us,” Faiz said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-82096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SB 461 will provide up to nine units of financial aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant. <em>Will Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>In its current iteration, Senate Bill 461 (SB 461) will provide up to nine units of aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant, and would be valid for four-year students for two summer sessions, and valid to transfer students for one summer session.</p>\n<p>Generally, summer sessions are six weeks long, shorter than the standard 10 week quarter.</p>\n<p>“There are a couple changes this year, but it doesn’t have to do with the bill, it has to do with the climate,” Kuvimbinashe “Eddy” Chikukwa, chair for Coalition for a Better UC, said.</p>\n<p>He cited the election of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a reason for why the bill may pass this time.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom is] more favorable towards funding higher education… and really willing to reform the Cal Grant system in a way that we did not see last year.”</p>\n<p>Newsom, who previously sat on the UC Board of Regents, has been much more receptive to suggestions compared to former governor Jerry Brown, who had “a very antagonistic position with regards to the UC,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom] got to hear a lot of the complaints people had, and he got to hear a lot of the solutions people had regarding this issue… Gavin understands that you need to fund higher education so that students have adequate aid to get out faster.”</p>\n<p>Alongside the bill, students are pushing for a budget request to ensure that money is allocated specifically for summer aid.</p>\n<p>“Last year, a lot of people were hesitant to support it because if the bill were passed it would be drawn from the general fund, and there were concerns that this money could be taken from other students,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>SB 461 has drawn more support and grown a larger coalition of interest groups that are invested in reforming Cal Grant. The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) is co-sponsoring the bill, while the CSU Chancellor’s Office and the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) are also in support of it.</p>\n<p>“There is also the will to reform Cal Grant. There is an actual desire which is evidenced by the recent assembly,” Chikukwa said, in reference to the joint legislative hearing chaired by California State Assembly Members José Medina and Kevin McCarty on Feb. 6, where “Closing the Degree Gap” was discussed.</p>\n<p>Regarding the necessity of summer aid for eligible students, Chikukwa noted the projected deficit of college graduates by 2030.</p>\n<p>“We’re acknowledging the fact that there’s a 1.1 million college graduate deficit that’s going to happen, we’re acknowledging the fact that low-income students tend to be the ones who don’t graduate on time, and we’re acknowledging the fact that we need more of these students to graduate faster.”</p>\n<p>Chikukwa also noted how S.T.E.M. students, who don’t necessarily always pass their major classes, often must resort to taking summer classes.</p>\n<p>Another issue which arises is that major classes during the year are often overenrolled.</p>\n<p>“So the state is making us enroll all these students into these courses and we don’t have space to put you in right now, so the best option is summer, and the state is making the UC do this and not providing summer aid, which is problematic,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>The bill has a long way to go, however.</p>\n<p>“We just introduced it, this is still the ‘hip hip hurrah’ phase.”</p>\n<p>In order to become law, SB 461 must make it through the Senate Education Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate floor. Then, after this, it must go through the California State Assembly.</p>\n<p>However, Chikukwa is optimistic.</p>\n<p>“It was really scrutinized heavily last year. A lot of people looked at it and they made their suggestions, and so this year I haven’t heard too many objections because the final objection last year was the lack of a budget request. People didn’t have any problems with the language of the bill.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said the increase was vital, as the UC would have a $30 million hole in its funding without the hike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we are recommending… is a modest increase in non-resident student tuition, 2.6 percent. It’s basically a cost-of-living adjustment,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our primary purpose is to educate the next generation of Californians.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association (UCSA) has been the loudest voice against the tuition hike. UCSA President Caroline Siegel-Singh delivered a letter to state legislators on March 6, opposing both a non-resident student cap and the tuition hike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we discuss the importance of an affordable UC education, we cannot neglect that non-residents contribute a total of $120 million towards need-based financial aid through the UC grant and therefore support approximately 100,000 California residents,” the letter read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Sherry Lansing first proposed not voting on the issue, saying that she “came in with one point of view” and now felt conflicted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think there is so much more work to do on this. I think that we should hold off on this if possible and really talk to the legislature and really look at possible scholarships and how we handle this situation,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hadi Makarechian, chair of the Finance and Capital Strategies Committee, presented a recommendation from the committee to move forward with the $762 tuition increase, but said that there was opposition to the increase within the committee, including from himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several Regents voiced their concerns about the tuition hike, saying it would make the UC less of a “world-class institution” and accessible only to the very wealthy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Michael Cohen also pointed out that the increase would affect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) students who might be California residents but do not qualify for in-state tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When [students] get on campus, for me they’re all California students, and we have sort of a moral obligation to treat them the same way we would all of our other students,” he said about out-of-state students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent John A. Pérez said that until the Regents “reopen the discussion about pathways for financial aid for out-of-state students,” he could not support the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez also recommended “admission group cohort increases,” which would mean that when accepted, students would pay the listed rate at the time for the four years they attend a UC. Any tuition increases voted on when they are in school would not affect students currently enrolled, keeping tuition the same for a class of students when they first enter school up until they graduate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Regents plans to reconsider the tuition hike at their next meeting in May, which will be held at UC San Francisco. In the meantime, they will explore other avenues to resolve the $30 million budget hole, they decided at today’s meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One option they are looking to is asking the state legislature for money to sustain the programs that would be cut without the hike, as Napolitano noted that the state would not provide funds for out-of-state students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also intend to look for a way to differentiate DACA students from out-of-state and international students and develop a way to provide financial assistance for out-of-state students. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Lavagnino at Rusty’s Pizza Parlor.</span> <em>Cristian Loza / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late 2016, California voters passed Proposition 64, legalizing recreational marijuana use and cultivation for adults 21 and older. In January 2018, it became legal to both sell and tax the sales of marijuana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, “Where’s the pot?” Christian Alonso, field director of the Santa Barbara Young Democrats asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the two and a half year mark approaches since the passage of Prop 64, Santa Barbara has yet to see it’s first recreational dispensary. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/news/2018/jul/10/three-pot-shops-get-green-light-santa-barbara/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, three recreational cannabis dispensaries were authorized early last year to open in Santa Barbara city. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hear loud and clear that folks in Isla Vista want a dispensary in Isla Vista, and that makes sense, you don’t want the purchasing power of Isla Vistans to be sent out of Isla Vista where none of the tax revenue or benefit will go to I.V.,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams went on to address how taxed marijuana proceeds would go toward hiring marijuana regulation employees, such as law enforcement and ad commissioners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After speaking to a consultant, they speculate we could make between 5 and 25 million dollars a year,” Williams said. “This taxed money is collected by Santa Barbara County  and would go back to funding the people and not the government itself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prop 64 elicits specific </span><a href=\"https://dispensarypermits.com/united-states-marijuana-dispensary-laws/open-a-dispensary-in-california/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that must be followed when establishing a retail dispensary. For example, dispensaries must be at least 600 feet from any school (K-12), daycare or youth center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams speculated I.V. would receive a recreational dispensary, but the location must be precise due to youth centers like UCSB’s Children’s Center and I.V. Elementary School.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have more plans for retail, we are just trying to figure out how that’s going to work,” Lavagnino said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People still have really strong feelings about it, it’s like navigating a public minefield,” Lavagnino said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_64,_Marijuana_Legalization_(2016)\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ballotpedia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 57 percent of Californians voted yes to Prop 64 in 2016, which allowed recreational marijuana use for those over the age of 21. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Legalizing marijuana is more ethical than buying it off the black market,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federally, marijuana is still </span><a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">classified</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it is addictive with no medical value. This places it in the same category as cocaine and methamphetamines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A regime which uplifts, reforms and permits the best of the operations and crushes the worst is what we want. The potential of hurting the cartel with legalization is something really powerful,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s all about tracking and trace of custody, we want people to know where their marijuana will be coming from.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He continued to discuss how a retail store is much safer than many of the commonly offered marijuana delivery services, because they can be regulated and tracked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are some things that are really bad about marijuana. For example, it affects your level of motivation. But compared to other medications like opiates, there is no comparison,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the drug becomes progressively more available, Williams and Lavagnino suspect that a lot of marijuana’s negative stigma will begin to fade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’ll just take time and exposure,” Lavagnino said.</span></p><div

However, in December, his lawyers filed to change the trial date to a readiness and settlement conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Jan. 16, Galoustian’s lawyers then requested to continue the case until Feb. 13, and then again to March 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge James Herman granted the extensions both times, albeit reluctantly. At each court appearance, Herman criticized how long it was taking to resolve the case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At today’s appearance, Herman told both parties that they either had to settle or set a trial date today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jennifer Karapetian and Lauren Franco, the attorneys prosecuting the case for the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office, told the judge they “don’t oppose” the July trial date, given that Galoustian’s current attorney, Leonard Levine, had only joined the case in January. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine said he needed more time to review the hours of video footage from discovery, which is why he asked for the trial to be set for late July. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both parties said they anticipate the trial to take 15 court days, which includes jury selection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernan also set an interim court appearance for May 29 to check in on the status of the trial preparation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 33 felony charges were filed on behalf of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/galoustian-will-face-charges-on-behalf-of-two-victims-during-january-trial/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two victims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported in October 2018.

id=\"caption-attachment-86546\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The pair spoke at UCSB on March 1. <em>Courtesy of Blake Simons and Delency Parham</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexandra Gessesse, financial director of UCSB’s Black Student Union, introduced the two hosts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While it may be March 1, Black History Month has no end, it’s all year long. I’m excited and honored to announce that tonight we can continue and uphold that legacy with some of the most radical organizers I know,” Gessesse said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gessesse urged students in attendance to support the hosts through Patreon, the content creator crowdfunding service, as few publicly funded resources exist for this kind of political education, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without the funds we really can’t be free and educate our people, which is something I really admire about their labor,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham, in his opening remarks, addressed the audience on his and Simons’ intention to establish a safe and inclusive space for the duration of their show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Definitely want to start by acknowledging this room is a safe space for all Black folks, we’re not free until all of us are free. If you’re not with that shit, y’all know where the exits are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham said he decided to start the podcast after graduating with a degree in journalism and spending a week with his mentor in New York, who was already a podcaster. He recalled being repulsed that the superficial commentary and focus on trivial issues by white men received obscenely high compensation, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All I seen was hella white men talking about shit that didn’t matter. It’s disgusting when you see how much white folks get paid for their bad ideas,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham and Simons called attention to their organization, the People’s Breakfast Oakland, stating that merely talking about Black issues was inadequate when people are not addressing material needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important that we engage in these communities that we claim to serve … what are you doing besides just talking about shit?” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tradition for the podcast, Parham and Simons began the night with their segment called “Black Joy,” where the co-hosts highlight a recent positive experience in their lives in-between episodes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A part of the Black burden is life being constantly born into the struggle, everything we do is politicized, everything we do gotta be serious [and] everything we do gotta be for liberation,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the reasons why we start the podcast [this way] is to center joy and having joy in the movement is important. Black joy, not that white shit, that hella Black joy,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons then addressed the contradiction of being an individual Black student charting their own educational path, particularly in a predominantly white institution, with the reality that the mass struggle of Black people is why they are allowed to attend, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We go to these institutions but what is the institution telling us to do? Who is the institution training us to become? Are we going to get a degree and work at Goldman Sachs or are we going to get a degree and help our people?” Simons said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a recurring theme throughout the live show; Simons and Parham said that as educated, radical organizers, they believe in the importance of Black students putting into practice the knowledge they gain in higher education in order to benefit their communities.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What can you do as a Black student to advance the next generations of people, because there will [always] be another 18-year-old or 17-year-old. How can you make this campus more inclusive to them?”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons brought up his time as a BSU organizer at UC Berkeley, and Parham discussed his reporting of the BSU’s fight for institutional change at the university to benefit Black students. These actions led to the creation of the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham encouraged students to remain resolute and aware of the importance of their activism and its precedent in the Black struggle, claiming “don’t let these crackers sway you, period, point blank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In thinking about Black students and [their] activism, we really have to demand and always keep carrying that torch forward because when we stop carrying that torch, Black students are going to drop off,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What can you do as a Black student to advance the next generations of people, because there will [always] be another 18-year-old or 17-year-old. How can you make this campus more inclusive to them?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair commented on the developing situation and statement from the UCSB’s BSU Demands Team, who have been fighting for a black resource and development center over the past 50 years. UCSB recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">addressed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and agreed to meet several of the BSU’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons advised Black students to fight for their people on and off-campus as well, thinking about those who cannot afford to attend college. Simons reiterated his and Parham’s stance on Black students using their education to advance the cause of their people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you can’t explain these theories that you’re learning to your cousin or to your grandma, what good is that theory? What good is talking if you ain’t taking action?” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hosts then offered their thoughts on the forthcoming election campaigns for President of the United States, particularly on Kamala Harris.

music major from UCSB in 2018 and has since worked to help local animals in need.</p>\n<p>“Right around now, early March is when we start getting hundreds of baby birds. Usually, it’s about 200 baby animals in our care at a time. That can also be baby mammals like bunnies and squirrels and raccoons,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Garvais explained that March 1 is the unofficial beginning of baby bird season, when birds including mockingbirds, towheess, sparrows, finches, crows and seagulls begin to hatch from their nests.</p>\n<p>She also emphasized the difference between birds in the hatchling, nestling and fledgling stages of development, as they should each be treated in a different way.</p>\n<p>“Hatchlings are straight out of the egg, within the past couple days. Nestlings have a couple of feathers, but are still mostly naked and are around a week old. Fledglings are fully feathered, and they are almost ready to fly,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>If found on the ground, hatchlings and nestlings should be returned to their nest if possible. However, it is normal for fledglings leave the nest as they mature.</p>\n<p>“They do spend some time on the ground for a little while once they are fully feathered, hopping around and learning how to fly. That’s normal. Their muscles are still developing for a couple of weeks,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to instruct people not to kidnap animals that don’t need to be saved. The best way for any baby to grow up is with their parents, so if you see a baby the first instinct shouldn’t be ‘I need to get this out immediately,’ it should be ‘I need to call for help.’ ”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Baby birds are hatching all over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCSB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UCSB</a>!

As soon as they are snagged, they just break off so the cat can’t get injured,” Garvais said. According to Garvais, cats are the top danger to birds in the area, injuring over 200 birds in the Santa Barbara area each year.</p>\n<p>If a bird seems injured or orphaned, or if the nestling’s nest cannot be found, Garvais encourages students to contact SBWCN’s rescue hotline at (805) 681-1080.</p>\n<p>Once under the care of SBWCN, the rescued animals will receive attentive support until they are ready to be released back into the wild.</p>\n<p>“For hummingbirds, we feed them special nectar that we get from Denmark. It’s specifically the best hummingbird nectar that you can get,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Songbirds are fed a mixture of mealworms, yogurt and vitamins that are blended together like a smoothie. They are fed by volunteers every 20 to 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Garvais hopes to debunk common misconceptions students may have about treating injured birds.</p>\n<p>“There are all these myths associated with baby birds that if you touch one then its parents won’t be able to recognize it anymore. That is totally false. We don’t recommend that people touch the animals more than they need to be, but in order to renest a baby bird, it can be put back,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Garvais herself first learned about SBWCN when her friends brought an injured duck into her dorm room while she was living in San Miguel Hall. After a quick Google search, she discovered SBWCN and decided to take the duck over.</p>\n<p>“I actually got an Uber and brought the bird to them. It was really cool to know that this resource exists,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Garvais feels that many UCSB and Isla Vista residents don’t know about SBWCN, especially due to the constantly changing population of college students. Garvais hopes to raise awareness so that more animals are able to receive the help they need.</p>\n<p>“Just like [how] people save the CSO number in their phones, we are hoping that people can save our helpline, because you never know when you are going to find an animal in need,” Garvais said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.
