id=\"caption-attachment-87502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands themselves were primarily written toward the end of Winter Quarter. </span><em>Courtesy of Isabella Liu</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the demands team, the term “Pan Asian” refers to those who are of Southeast Asian, South Asian and Pacific Islander descent, along with those who identify as Asian American, multi-ethnic students, international students from Asia, immigrants, refugees, undocumented students from Asia and first-generation students of Asian descent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands are separated into three main sections: academic programs, campus resources and campus programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “academic programs” section demands the strengthening of the Asian American studies department and says UCSB must hire five new tenure-track faculty members and two new staff members in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not like the professors aren’t doing good work, it’s that they are one of the smallest departments on our campus,” Ng said. “They have six tenured faculty members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ng, a fourth-year biological sciences and global studies double major, said this number is not where the department should be, especially considering that the Asian American studies department in theory should “provide enough academia and knowledge and research” for almost a third of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What’s really interesting is that UCSB was the first university in the entire country to offer an Asian American studies B.A., but if you track the progression of when we first offered it to now, the department has only grown by three members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “academic programs” section also calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary graduate emphasis in Asian American studies, as well as institutional support and funding for the Asian Pacific Islander Graduate Student Alliance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “campus resources” section demands that UCSB mandates “in-person interactive workshops in issues specifically pertaining to Pan Asian students to all employed staff” in Student Health Services, Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS), Campus Advocacy Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and the Office of Student Life (OSL), among other entities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s been a really big issue with people not recognizing that Asia represents a continent,” Ng said. “The point of the trainings is for us to get staff up to the knowledge that we would like to see them at, to realize the different needs of different cultural groups.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “campus resources” section also demands that UCSB create paid positions for “increased Pan Asian representation in CAPS, EOP, Undocumented Student Services and Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises.” Additionally, the Pan Asian Network demands that UCSB administration identify which languages are spoken by Pan Asian students and then pay for accurate translations of UCSB materials accordingly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They kind of just assume that all Indian students speak Hindi, and not, like, Tamil,” Ng said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final “campus programs” section calls on UCSB to create a Pan Asian Center that would focus “on providing opportunities to foster inclusivity among all members of the UCSB Pan Asian community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board of the Pan Asian Center would comprise a director, a programming coordinator and a publicity coordinator. The center would also offer paid student staff positions, according to the demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All members of the board would be paid a salary, according to Ng. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Thirty [percent] of our student body has one room on campus that represents their cultural identity where they can meet, socialize and find a central home. There’s no way that room can do all of that,” Ng said, referring to the Asian Resource Center in the Student Resource Building.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ng added that the Pan Asian Center does not necessarily need to be a new, standalone building constructed specifically for this purpose. Ng said a separate building, similar to El Centro, would be ideal, but indicated that the Pan Asian Network is flexible on this issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ng said the Pan Asian Network demands team is made up of eight undergraduate students and that the team formed “very organically.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It ended up being through word of mouth of who was already Asian and in the activist community, which is a pretty small group of people,” Ng added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands themselves started to gain traction during Winter Quarter 2019.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that time, we weren’t really sure what we should call ourselves. We didn’t want it to be extremely East Asian-centric,” Isabella Liu, another member of the demands team, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Liu, a second-year communication and philosophy double major, the demands team was created after the Asian-Pacific Islander (API) town halls, held by the API Task Force, during Fall and Winter Quarter. The demands themselves were primarily written toward the end of Winter Quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We sent it out to other organizations with members that would fit under the Pan Asian category and had them submit any recommendations and changes that they would like to see, and we tried to include them as best as we could,” Liu said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pan Asian Network also circulated a survey on Facebook to gather input on what students wanted to see in the demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re lucky that our board is very diverse in that we have East Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and mixed race [students], so we have a pretty diverse board at least to draw from experience,” Ng said. “It’s really hard to get 30% of the student body to agree on one thing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Ng and Liu hope that Chancellor Yang is receptive to the list of demands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea is for as many students as possible to join the Pan Asian Network in delivering the demands to Chancellor Yang’s office,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our hope is that, given he is an Asian American, and that he’s existed within this world, that he can also empathize and realize what we’re asking for and why  need it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liu said there are currently two Associated Students senators working on a resolution in support of the Pan Asian Network demands. The senators plan to introduce the resolution during Wednesday night’s senate meeting.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liu said she is a student sponsor of the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pan Asian Network demands follow the Black Student Union (BSU) demands released earlier this school year, in which the BSU called for a similar increase in resources for Black students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We definitely saw the momentum that BSU had, and we were inspired by that,” Liu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the things we demand just happen to be very similar because they’ve been neglected by the administration for so long. There are definitely parallels, and we see them as well, but I wouldn’t necessarily say that our demands themselves were directly influenced by BSU,” Liu added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands in full can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/PAN-Demands-2019-1.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/PAN-Demands-2019-1.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that Rachel Ng suggested using El Centro for the Pan Asian Center; however, the article has been updated to clarify that Ng actually said<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a separate building, similar to El Centro, would be ideal. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Senate resolutions actually affect university policy?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no direct percentage of Senate resolutions that affect university policy. There are several different types of bills/resolutions that the Senate passes, but the main two are positional and directional resolutions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positional bill/resolution is one that “endorses, sponsors, or supports a group’s actions or events.” Positional resolutions require a two thirds vote. For example, a positional resolution passed this past year was one in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/a-s-passes-three-resolutions-in-support-of-afscme-strike-one-which-suspends-a-s-operations-in-solidarity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support of the AFSCME strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A directional bill/resolution is one that “directs members of A.S. Personnel, Boards, Committees and/or the Senate to specific duties.” A directional resolution requires a 50% plus 1 vote – in the case of the 69th Senate, 13 votes. One example of a directional resolution passed by the Senate during this past year is “The King’s A+ For Excellence Awards,” </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/new-resolution-keeps-former-a-s-advisor-kings-legacy-alive/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which awards five students each a $500 grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further details about the types of bills and resolutions that the Senate can pass begins on page 313 of Legal Code under the Policy 6: Main Motions section in the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do my student fees go?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of the 2018-2019 school year, students pay $631.83 in A.S. and Graduate Student Association (GSA) fees and $1,188.87 in lock-in fees – overall, paying $1,820.70 in student fees each school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student fees given to A.S. fund Arts &amp; Lectures, the Child Care Center, Campus Learning Assistive Services (C.L.A.S.), Disabled Student Services, the Events Center, intramural sports, the Multi-Cultural Center, the Office of Student Life, Recreational Sports, the Coastal Fund, Student Health and the University Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students fees designated as lock-in fees include Arts &amp; Lectures, bike path maintenance, a second C.L.A.S. fee, Career Services, C.A.P.S., E.O.P., Event Center, the Green Initiative</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fund (TGIF)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Health &amp; Wellness, a second MCC fee, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the Recreation Center among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fees fall under both of these categories, such as two separate MCC fees and two C.L.A.S. fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact breakdown of fees for the 2018-2019 school year can be found <a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/2018-19cbf.pdf?sfvrsn=6518aa46_2\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>How were both parties founded? Why do they have a rivalry? How are they related to OPP and DP parties?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United was founded in Feb. 2016, and </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ran candidates for the first time </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the Spring Quarter 2016 elections. The Isla Vista Party was founded in Feb. 2017 and </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ran candidates for the first time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Spring Quarter 2017 Elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time the Open People’s Party (OPP) ran candidates in an election was in </span><a href=\"https://elections.as.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spring-2015.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter 2015.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported in 2016 that many former OPP members “now identify with the new groups.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time the Democratic Process Party (DP) ran candidates was in </span><a href=\"https://elections.as.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spring-2014-Election-Results.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter 2014</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cannot speak to the rivalry between the two. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do the candidates plan to lower student fees?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, only one candidate – presidential candidate Alison Sir – has said she wanted to lower student fees. The other presidential candidate, Zion Solomon, said during the presidential candidate forum that they would like to keep student fees the same, emphasizing the importance of the fees for creating programs that benefit students. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is the minimum voting percentage threshold needed to win if a candidate is unopposed?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated in A.S. Legal Code, at least 20% of all eligible undergraduate students must vote in the election for it to be valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For individual candidates, Elections Board uses the Droop Quota to calculate the minimum number of voters needed for a candidate to be elected. The formula is as follows: Votes Needed = (Valid Votes Cast / Number of Seats + 1) + 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further information about the quota can be found on page 298 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is a special election? Is this a special election?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not a special election. A special election can happen when a position within the executive offices – such as the president, EVPLA, EVPSA, IVP or S.A.G. – becomes vacant. Special election rules are controlled by Elections Board. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, there have been two special elections: the first in Fall Quarter 2018 and the second in Winter Quarter 2019. Both elections attempted to fulfill the vacant EVPSA position; during both, less than the minimum required number of students voted, invaliding the results. </span></p>\n<p><b>Who is advising elections? Who are members of the committee in charge of elections? Do we get to see the minutes?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Elections Board is in charge of the elections. There are seven members of the board, and they are advised by Kendra Sandoval and Ruth Garcia Guevara. Election Board minutes are not open to the public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are on Elections Board cannot run for any senatorial or executive position or be a representative for any campus political party. </span></p>\n<p><b>Is results night still in the UCen?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Results night will happen in the UCen’s Hub at 7 p.m. on Thursday, April 25. </span></p>\n<p><b>What endorsements besides the </b><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b> can candidates get? Is there a list? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is not an explicit list of who can endorse, but rather only a list of who cannot endorse candidates. As stated in Legal Code, all A.S. entities cannot endorse candidates and parties. Further details about endorsements can be found on page 283 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 22, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why doesn’t A.S. have greater authority over the Isla Vista area?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. has representation within I.V. through the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) position, held by third-year global studies major Jeike Meijer. The EVPLA can advocate on behalf of UCSB students’ needs in I.V., but they cannot make direct changes to laws; instead, they work with governmental bodies that make those decisions, such as the I.V. Recreation and Parks District and the I.V. Community Service District, to make change within the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB owns property in I.V., but cannot control or make decisions over I.V. as a whole because, by nature, the two are separate. UCSB is a university; I.V. is an unincorporated district – and home to families, private businesses and more, not just students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because UCSB and I.V.’s histories are so intertwined, there are ways in which the university can directly or indirectly exert influence over what happens in I.V. For example, the university has a representative on the I.V. CSD, who serves as a coordinator between the two entities. Additionally, UCSB gives a $200,000 grant to the district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates for this year’s EVPLA election are third-year political science Matthew Griffin and third-year environmental studies major Christian Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><b>What kind of compensation do A.S. members receive?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. executive director and other full-time staff members within A.S. receive yearly salaries. For example, the current A.S. executive director, Marisela Marquez, received $110,911 for the 2017 fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Executives receive $3,000 per quarter, while A.S. senators receive $400 dollars per quarter for serving on the Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both face different sets of rules and requirements, which can be found in A.S. legal code. </span></p>\n<p><b>Does the Daily Nexus have beef with the A.S.

What’s up with always criticizing their shortcomings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not “have beef” with the A.S. Senate. Just as with any other relationship between reporters and the government officials they cover, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports on both the Senate’s shortfalls and its successes. As a campus newspaper, it is important that we hold A.S. accountable because, after all, the same people who read the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are the ones giving A.S. their money to spend. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the ideological differences between CU and I.V. party?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During our endorsement interviews, we asked each candidate running for an executive position about the difference between Campus United and the Isla Vista Party, and they all gave various vague answers. Some candidates said their party thinks outside of the box, while others said their party was like a family to them. The executive candidates also emphasized that they would not speak about the opposing party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United has a website that includes information about its platform: </span><a href=\"https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Party has a Facebook page that is regularly updated.

For example, the A.S. Program Borard is funded by student fees, as well as the Bike Shop, Queer Commission, Food Bank and many others. You can find the full list of A.S. funded entities here: </span><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 16, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why should I care?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student enrolled at UCSB pays </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.61 every quarter to Associated Students to go toward “a wide variety of operations of Associated Students that benefit the students of UCSB, the campus and the surrounding community,” as written on the A.S. Finance and Business website. This amounts to an estimated $14 million a year, as of last reported numbers. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the different A.S. positions? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. serves as an umbrella for dozens of organizations. The most well-known divisions of A.S. include the legislative branch (the A.S. Senate), the executive branch (the A.S. Executives) and the judicial branch (the A.S. Judicial Council). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the A.S. Senate, there are 25 senatorial positions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 25 senators are elected based on different constituencies; there are 12 off-campus senator seats, five on-campus senator seats, four Letters &amp; Science senator seats, one College of Engineering senator seat, one College of Creative Studies senator seat, one transfer senator seat and one university-owned off-campus senator seat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been no College of Creative Studies senator for the past school year, and no students have declared candidacy for the seat this year’s election as of press time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the executive branch, there are five A.S. executive positions: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UCSBASOP/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ivpucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">internal vice president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (IVP), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbEVPSA/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARB6ux9CZOA9eMPbLvNNLuo5kIGZGoj3jtgxwRvfm0rLaYKe9A5qbzuS2FCpyxrzSJFwR85Z0BVYmuyX\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for statewide affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPSA), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/evplaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for local affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPLA) and the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/osaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student advocate general</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (S.A.G.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EVPSA position has been vacant since Spring Quarter 2018 following the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales and the two subsequent special elections that failed to meet the voter threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The president serves as a representative of UCSB at the systemwide level and is a voice for students within the UCSB administration. They also work on projects within their own office to enhance the UCSB student experience and sit on various committees around campus. The IVP presides over the A.S. Senate, and has the power to serve as a tie-breaking vote. The EVPLA works with local government bodies, such as the I.V. Community Services District and the I.V. Recreation and Park District. The EVPSA advocates for UCSB student issues at the state and federal level. Finally, the S.A.G. heads up the Office of the Student Advocate, which provides support for students/student groups who are involved in a dispute with the university.</span></p>\n<p><b>How can you reach out to your senators and other executives?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple ways to contact your senators and executives. As of this year, the 69th senate passed a resolution that requires senators to provide their constituencies with an official Facebook page. A.S. executives also have official Facebook pages, where you will find their office hours, the location of their office hours, contact info and projects they are currently undertaking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address the entire Senate as a whole, students or community members can speak at public forum during weekly Senate meetings, which begin at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in the Flying A room of the University Center. The Senate does not hold meetings during Week 10 or finals week. </span></p>\n<p><b>When does voting begin?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting officially begins on April 22 at 8 a.m., or Monday of Week 4. It ends on April 25 at 4 p.m. The results will be announced on April 25 at a time and place to be determined. Log onto G.O.L.D. to cast your vote.</span></p>\n<p>A full version of A.S.

QLess aims to streamline this process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We see a real surge typically after lunch. I know it’s a challenge to get up in the morning early, but if you want to see advising on a drop-in basis, mornings are great.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This program is available for general and honors advising located at 1117 Cheadle Hall, pre-health admission advising located at 2105 North Hall and pre-law advising located at 2105 North Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple noted that due to an unusually large freshman class this year, there is an increased demand in advising lines. He pointed out that the students coming to academic advising also have more nuanced academic backgrounds to work with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Entering first-year students have more complex records when they get here. They have AP classes, a lot of them did IB, a lot more students are doing dual enrollment, we have more international students who have complicated records,” he said.  “So in order to figure out what they’ve done and what they need to do, there’s more advising necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advising department has also greatly expanded in order to address that need in the last decade, he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As recently as 10 years ago, there were maybe six or eight advisers for the whole college, and now, depending on some variables involving staff turnovers and leaves and things like that, we’re, like, 18, 22 [advisors]. We’ve grown a lot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple also said that he hopes there will be a transition away from physical paperwork to digital alternatives in terms of petitions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’d like to get rid of paper petitions. That’s obviously insane in the 21st century to be carrying pieces of paper around and standing in line, and that’s something we’re moving toward as well.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87475\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87475\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/","id":2085,"author":{"id":62,"name":"Emily Komessar"},"related":[2084,2083,2082],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Recap: S.A.G.

It requires approaching these student cases with a level of humanity and empathy in order to best understand and listen to the people that you’re actually serving,” Nguyen said during the S.A.G. forum on Monday, which began at 1:30 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this past year, Nguyen served as an off-campus senator with the 69th Senate. However, when asked about his past involvement with the OSA, he stated he had “zero experience” in the office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a job I’ve never done before. And so that’s why I really want to be, throughout this entire year, is [be] honest with my students, with my constituents,” he said during the forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how I’m going to do this job, but [based] off my experience as an off-campus senator this year, I can tell you at the very least, I’m excited.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he plans to increase awareness and improve the image of the OSA through two ways: social media and physical presence. He noted that being active on social media platforms to spread information and establishing a physical campus presence through tabling and door-to-door operations are key to making the OSA a trustworthy, compassionate and welcoming space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said he plans to continue a project left behind by Jack Tannenbaum, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-s-a-g-jack-tannenbaum/\">the 2017-2018 Student Advocate General.</a> Tannenbaum’s project focused on a poll that would be used to collect data at the end of elections on what students are most concerned about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen wants to improve upon the poll by sending it out in the middle of the year through G.O.L.D. and carrying out door-to-door operations in order to work on initiatives earlier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also emphasized his understanding of the boundaries between confidentiality and transparency, stating that confidentiality is needed when dealing with student cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easy for people to take an oath to be confidential, but I believe that those words and those oaths only take a real shape when someone understands the impact it has on the people around them. And that’s something I believe I’ve really internalized,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said he prioritizes the safety of students. He added that the first step to combat threats of anti-Semitism and sexual harassment is to believe and listen to victims, and to work collaboratively with these groups in order to prioritize students’ safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope to be a beacon of inspiration for people to do more than what is at their most immediate inte</span>rest, their most convenient interest.”</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

The statement also noted that department staff and campus security were made aware of the incident around the same time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man was not apprehended and disappeared before law enforcement arrived, according to the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement was signed by Marisa D.

Fisher, Shawn Van Valkenburgh, Amanda Pinheiro, Sarah Manski, Andrew Johnson, Elliott Finn and Mariah Brennan Clegg.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the university is currently “aware of reports of someone wearing the ‘Waffen SS’ logo” and that an investigation followed the initial report, although no one was apprehended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another incident where anti-semitic flyers were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-07/a-s-senate-condemns-anti-semitism-in-response-to-anti-semitic-fliers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “on cars and buildings surrounding the residences of Jewish students in Isla Vista” occurred only two days earlier, according to the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Associated Students (A.S.) Senate released a formal statement regarding the flyers, denouncing it as “extremely derogatory” and “obscenely misrepresentative of Jewish people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We call upon the UCSB student body to actively stand in solidarity with our Jewish community by spreading awareness and education about anti-Semitism, and to quickly report any concering behavior,” the A.S. statement read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students echoed the sentiments of the statement published by A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduate students’ statement encouraged “immediate preventative action,” labeling such incidents as part of “an ever-growing tide of terrorist threats against students, staff, and faculty both here and at campuses across the United States.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement expressed a need for change through a demand for “Nazi symbols” to be considered a terrorist act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We insist that campus and union officials publicly recognize that the act of (uncritically) displaying Nazi symbols is a terrorist act,” the statement added. “Posting violent threats to Jews is racial terrorism that must not be tolerated anywhere, including our campus community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement acknowledged that campus security and department personnel have previously told students to report any “potentially threatening behaviors,” but noted that “there has yet to be any wide announcement to the campus community of the calculated dissemination of Nazi materials or of the sighting of Nazi apparel on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the statement justified its call for action, claiming that “such a warning and a call for action is necessary not only because students, staff, and faculty already vulnerable to violence have a right to know about potential threats… but more so because it is a certainty that someone in the broader community knows the person or persons making these terrorist threats.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement said there should be an institutional response centered on the well being and safety of UCSB students and employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An institutional response would have “the potential to prevent or at least minimize the severity of any future attack,” according to the statement. </span></p>\n<p>The statement in full can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Grad-Letter-to-UCSB-Officials-2.7.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Grad-Letter-to-UCSB-Officials-2.7.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

students each year. <em>Courtesy of Pamela Velazquez</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ucsbclop.com\">College Link Outreach Program</a> (C.L.O.P.) is a three-day, two-night program in which 150 underrepresented students across California are invited to the UCSB campus to explore opportunities for higher education.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. was originally created through the collaborative efforts of Hermanos Unidos, a Chicanx organization for University of California students, and Sigma Alpha Zeta, a multicultural group for women of color. The two organizations joined forces in 1999 to bring an inaugural group of 40 low-income students to the campus, according to the C.L.O.P. website.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. is an all-expense paid program that is fully funded by multiple Associated Students (A.S.) entities, including A.S Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC), Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.), Finance and Business (F&amp;B) and the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.).</p>\n<p>The program is also funded by individual donors and fundraisers, which take place throughout the entire school year.</p>\n<p>Over the past 20 years, the program has since expanded to serve 150 students each year. Students gain insight into the college experience by participating in workshops and attending mock lectures and overall gain exposure to campus resources.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. Coordinator Pamela Velazquez, a third-year sociology and Chicanx studies double major, has been involved with C.L.O.P. for the past three years.</p>\n<p>“I think our students often lack representation, so being able to see someone like you on a college campus can make a huge difference,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>“Institutions of higher education need to do a better job at reaching our students, but since it is not being done, it is up to us and programs like ours to really reach those students and impact them.”</p>\n<p>To get involved with C.L.O.P., high school students have to partake in an application process. C.L.O.P. outreach facilitators visit 20 participating high schools throughout Winter Quarter to encourage students to apply. Students then submit their field of interest, extracurriculars, community service hours and a two to three page personal statement explaining their motivations for attending college. Applications are due the March prior to the event.</p>\n<p>Several C.L.O.P. alumni have gone on to help lead the program themselves, including Entertainment Facilitator Kassandra Perez, a third-year financial math and statistics major.</p>\n<p>“My outlook has tremendously shifted now that I am part of the team because I see on a greater level how much this program is able to influence students,” Perez said in an email.</p>\n<p>“As a C.L.O.P.Per (our nickname for participants) I saw how the program impacted and helped me, but now that I am part of the team it is so rewarding to see all the students that have benefited from the program.”</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. participants are hosted by UCSB students in the Manzanita Village and San Rafael residence halls, a process that is facilitated by C.L.O.P. housing coordinators in collaboration with RHA. Participants eat in the various dining commons on campus throughout the course of the program, according to Velazquez.</p>\n<p>Participating students attend several workshops, including admissions, financial aid and A-G requirements workshops. These workshops are hosted by UCSB Admissions and Financial Aid staff, Perez said.</p>\n<p>“It is important to provide these students with this information because many of them will be first generation college students, and their parents/families may not be able to provide them with the insight they need to pursue a higher education,” Perez said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“C.L.O.P. is a way to remember that although we have made it this far and we continue to grow our experiences, a lot of students who were once like us are not.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Not having this information and not knowing what to do often discourages these students from applying to college.”</p>\n<p>Participants also attend several lifestyle workshops, including the “Gender Fishbowl,” in which they are separated into groups to discuss the difficulties that face young men and women of color. They also participate in the “Get a Life” workshop, which aims to represent the inequalities that certain social and class backgrounds face. After each workshop, facilitators lead a discussion to debrief each activity, highlighting the underlying meanings for students to take away.</p>\n<p>Several other events include an interactive chemistry demonstration and a “Know Your Rights” workshop, which teaches students how to proceed in situations that involve law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes we have students that may have difficulty when it comes to approaching police. They may have different feelings about the police in their own communities, so…we show them exactly how they should conduct themselves when approached,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. coordinators also put on a Resource Fair to highlight the opportunities that higher education has to offer. Several departments such as the Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E.) and Undocumented Student Services will be in attendance this year, in addition to the local fire and police departments, according to Velazquez.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. concludes with a barbeque on the beach and a closing ceremony, during which all teams and C.L.O.P. contributors are recognized in a closing video. For its 20th anniversary this year, C.L.O.P. will feature alumni and their experiences in the program via video submission.</p>\n<p>The program is also offering a new scholarship designed to help past C.L.O.P.Pers as they continue their journeys through higher education, another component of the program’s 20th anniversary celebration. The scholarship will involve an application process and be offered to one member of each grade.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. has placed an emphasis on expanding its social media presence in the past years as well, which has significantly contributed to the growth of the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m really proud of our social media so far. We have really started working with it to reach students, we know its the best way to reach them at their age,” Velasquez said.</p>\n<p>WIth social media campaigns like #CLOPWorks on the C.L.O.P. Instagram page, students are able to send in stories of how C.L.O.P. helped them and what their future plans were after attending the program, according to Velasquez.</p>\n<p>“Our students will ask questions about financial aid and classes, and that’s also the way we are able to connect to them through surveys or anything like that,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>Perez has a dynamic perspective on the impact of C.L.O.P. on the lives of students, having experienced being both a team leader and “C.L.O.P.Per” herself.</p>\n<p>“As a high schooler coming from a low-income family, I always knew I wanted to go to college, but always felt discouraged because I never thought that someone like me would be able to afford college or even be able to make it to college,” Perez said in the email.</p>\n<p>“C.L.O.P. benefited my life because prior to coming to the program, I didn’t even know what UCSB was, nor did I ever think I would ever apply here. Now I can proudly say that C.L.O.P. definitely influenced me to attend UCSB and give back to my community and students like myself.”</p>\n<p>Like Perez, Velasquez is passionate about C.L.O.P.’s impact on the lives of participants, as well as the necessity for such outreach programs on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“C.L.O.P. serves as an opportunity to inspire others and to grow as a college student as well. Sometimes college kind of takes a toll on us and we stop seeing what really matters and really caring about our communities,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>“C.L.O.P. is a way to remember that although we have made it this far and we continue to grow our experiences, a lot of students who were once like us are not.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-87334\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This year’s Deltopia saw an increase in arrests, but a decrease in medical transports. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The office has yet to release an exact breakdown of the data gathered by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) and the University of California Police Department (UCPD), but the preliminary report, released on April 8, shows that there were 94 citations, 38 arrests and 19 medical transports — all alcohol and/or drug related — given out this past Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both locals and out-of-towners were featured on the list of this year’s citations and arrests, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only 10 days into April 2019, this month has seen more arrests than any month over the past six — a fact undeniably due to Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was very pleased to see that the number of medical hospitalizations was far lower than last year, proportionate to the size of the event,” Isla Vista Community Service District (I.V. CSD) President Spencer Brandt said in a message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Brandt noted the arrest log “clearly demonstrates” that there is still a problem with out-of-towners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to be moving towards a deltopia that is organized by the community, and has a festival-like atmosphere. The reactive approach that UCSB, the County, the CSD, and other stakeholders have taken over the past 5 years has only taken us so far. It’s time for proactive solutions that transform Deltopia from an unsanctioned into an organized, fun, and safe festival,” Brandt said in a Facebook message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendance for Deltopia, an event that evolved nearly 10 years ago following the shutdown of Floatopia, steadily grew in its initial years; however, following the 2014 Deltopia riots, which ended in tear gas and rubber bullets as previously reported by the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, attendance dramatically dropped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, however, attendance appears to be rising again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 12,000 to 15,000 partygoers filled the streets of I.V. this year, slightly up from the 10,000 that the SBSO recorded in 2018, but still significantly less than the crowd of 20,000 to 25,000 that attended Deltopia in 2014, according to the report.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87309\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/deltopia-2019_siavash-ghadiri_online-4/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87309\" data-attachment-id=\"87309\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/deltopia-2019_siavash-ghadiri_online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Deltopia 2019_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87309\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UCIV volunteers handed out water to partygoers. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought Deltopia was very respectful. Everything went smoothly from my end and we were able to deploy UCIV shifts which was very successful,” Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs Jeike Meijer said in a message to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many people came up for water and were very grateful. The estimated number of people who came was higher than we expected but everything remained calm.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that this year, several people told her Deltopia felt like a “community event.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one attended our extra office hours on monday which hopefully meant there were no pressing concerns to address with the EVPLA office, but if there are of course people can always still reach out to us. but overall, deltopia went smoothly and people seemed to be respecting each other and the space,” Meijer said in a Facebook message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The press release consistently references Deltopia statistics from five years ago, noting that in spite of the increase in arrests since 2018, “citations and medical transports are still all less than half of what they were in 2014.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the alcohol and/or drug related incidents requiring medical transports were two cases where people fell. One young woman fell and hit her head on a rock, and another young woman fell from a cliff located in the 6800 block of Del Playa “during a domestic dispute.” Neither sustained fatal injuries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the arrests were for disorderly conduct due to alcohol, as seen in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ arrest map. A few other individuals were arrested for assault, vandalism or petty theft, and one individual was arrested for sodomy by force/violence/fear, use of force with great bodily injury and violation of probation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two Deltopia attendees were also arrested in I.V. late Sunday night for armed robbery, among other charges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of direct police intervention, the authorities also stopped and arrested 18-year-old De’shon Wilson, an Oregon native, for allegedly knocking a young man unconscious in the 6500 block of Del Playa, according to the report. Wilson was subsequently kept at Santa Barbara County Jail on assault charges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputies from SBSO and the UCPD also reportedly shut down around 10 parties that day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deltopia finally drew to a close in the evening as, per the report, the 6 p.m. noise ordinance kicked in and thousands of students emptied out of I.V. and flocked to The Warm Up concert hosted by UCSB at the Thunderdome. The concert, featuring TroyBoi and JPEGMAFIA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ran from 7:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. </span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the Warm Up and Deltopia can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-10/in-photos-the-warmup-with-jpegmafia-troyboi/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/in-photos-deltopia-2019/\">here.</a></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/","id":3223,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[3222,3221,3220],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"SPRING (BEACH) CLEANING Had a sloppy Deltopia?

Then this might be the right opportunity for you. Set yourself straight this weekend and join the Isla Vista Surfriders in an effort to pick those Natty Daddys out of the sand. The event takes place from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. this Sunday at Devereux Beach. If you know your volunteer credit is going to take a backseat later on this quarter, then don’t forget to bring your volunteer hour form to get credit for all your hard work. If your last weekend was particularly rough, we can pretend that didn’t happen. Weekend one truly started now, just don’t tell anyone.</p>\n<p><b>BUST DOWN WITH BIKO</b></p>\n<p>If you’re a fan of neck cramps and stained white vans, then Biko Garage is no stranger to you. Wacko, Lead, Powerslave, The Dory’s and Cruelty will be putting the noise ordinance to work so you’ll have no reason to wallow in boredom tomorrow night. The event takes place this Thursday from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. and is hosted by Biko Garage, located at 6612 Sueno Road. These fine musicians, from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles, have been shredding strings and breaking cymbals all along Southern California. Beer die is a weekend sport, so burn some real calories tomorrow night and forget that you have a section the next morning.</p>\n<p><b>GET DOWN AND DIRTY</b></p>\n<p>This Saturday, the Isla Vista Food Co-op, located at 6575 Seville Road, is hosting an event that you absolutely cannot scrap. The County Composting Workshop, held in conjunction with the Public Works department of Santa Barbara and the UC Santa Barbara Department of Public Worms, will be teaching attendees how to properly manage their backyard compost. The event takes place from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and will teach you what foods can be composted as well as how to properly compost food. The event is only hosted once a year, so don’t miss out! If you stay the whole time, you’ll also be eligible to win your very own worm-composting bin! Now who wouldn’t want that?</p>\n<p><b>COP SOME FRESH THREADS</b></p>\n<p>Have bad spending habits and a bad eye for clothing? Look no further. Santa Barbara-based collector Andi Mondugno has pre-selected all the lovely attire set at painless prices. Swing by the Isla Vista Food Co-op at 6575 Seville Road this Sunday anytime from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m., and peruse the visually-delectable array of clothes, shoes and accessories. The Lazy Eye Pop-up, as it is officially called, is a great opportunity to freshen up that spring-cleaned wardrobe with sensible threads from up-cycled clothing.</p>\n<p><b>JAM TO (ROCK)FIRE BEATS</b></p>\n<p>Are you a fan of NOVA?

CSD discussed the resolution at several board meetings before it passed on Tuesday. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Resolution No. 19-7 calls for the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board of Directors to recognize the Chumash people’s historical and ongoing ties to I.V., also known as Anisq’oyo, through an acknowledgement at the beginning of all meetings.</p>\n<p>Anisq’oyo, part of the home of the Chumash people, encompasses the land that I.V. and UC Santa Barbara both reside on.</p>\n<p>I.V CSD staff members and Board President Spencer Brandt worked with Mia Lopez, a representative of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, to draft the acknowledgement and learn more about the heritage of the Chumash people.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just recognizing the past, but acknowledging those of the present and our future. We need to educate our community about the forgotten history that is our history,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>UCSB has also started using a similar land acknowledgement in graduation ceremonies and convocations for new students, according to Lopez. Multiple departments have begun to do the same at the beginning of their meetings as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s just incredibly important, I think, that we can serve as a model for something that local governments can do in whatever small way to try to do our part to rewrite history and not be silencing voices, both of the past and the present,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Annette Cordero, a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, explained how vital it is for governing bodies such as I.V. CSD to set an example for the rest of the community to remember the history of the people who occupied it for centuries.</p>\n<p>“It is healing for us. It does our hearts and our souls good to have this kind of recognition. On behalf of our, as we like to say for seven generations, our children and the children yet to come, this will have a meaning for them, so thank you,”  Cordero said.</p>\n<p>The resolution was adopted with a small amendment clarifying that the acknowledgement be recited at all meetings of the I.V. CSD, not just regular meetings. The resolution was passed with a 6-0 vote in favor and was met with a round of applause. Director George Thurlow was absent from the meeting.</p>\n<p>The full acknowledgement of the Chumash people and Anisq’oyo can be read below:</p>\n<p><i>“Before we begin, we would like to acknowledge the Chumash people, who are the traditional custodians of this land. We pay our respects to the Chumash elders, past, present, and future who call this place, Anisq’oyo, the land that Isla Vista sits upon, their home. We are proud to continue their tradition of coming together and growing as a community. We thank the Chumash community for their stewardship and support, and we look forward to strengthening our ties as we continue our relationship of mutual respect and understanding.”</i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

unveiled at the Isla Vista Community Center at 2 p.m., where artists and other attendees gathered to celebrate the pieces and their contribution to the visibility of undocumented students who identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n<p>The two murals were designed by UCSB Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success (I.D.E.A.S.) member, Apolinar De Jesus, and Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) Digital Production Coordinator, Dei Garcia.</p>\n<p>De Jesus, a second-year art major, said one of the pieces was primarily inspired by transgender activist and former UCSB student Zoraida Reyes. As an aspiring Chicana and Chicano Studies major, Reyes was an unrelenting advocate for undocumented students and the LBGTQ+ community up until her death in 2014.</p>\n<p>De Jesus’ mural pictures Reyes, along with the statement, “Our very existence is resistance.”</p>\n<p>The other mural outlines various historical legislative and judicial events that pertain to the experiences of the LBGTQ+ community.</p>\n<p>For example, Executive Order #13672, which added gender identity to the list of job applicant attributes that could not be used in instances of discrimination the 2015 <i>Obergefell</i> v. <i>Hodges</i> case that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States were both incorporated into the mural.</p>\n<p>The unveiling of the murals serves as only one of the many events held during UCSB’s 2019 Pride Week, in which various gatherings, performances and panels are held to address the many aspects of the LGBTQIA+ experience.</p>\n<p>Previous events involving UndocQueer and UndocuTrans students include several workshops and training sessions held during Immigration Awareness Week in January.</p>\n<p>The murals will be housed in the RCSGD and the Monarch Lounge, an on-campus space for undocumented students and allies.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

ongoing investigations into these labor practices by the UC. They’ve been trying to wash their hands of them, and soon it’s going to catch up to them,” said Erick Ceballos, a third-year political science major and student intern for AFSCME. “They can’t let it go without a fight.”</p>\n<p>University Professional and Technical Employees (UPTE), a worker’s union for professional and technical UC employees, joined AFSCME in protesting against the UC. UPTE represents more than 13,000 employees, while AFSCME Local 3299 represents more than 24,000 employees across the UC campuses.</p>\n<p>According to Jarrod Coldron, a former UCSB student, present-day groundskeeper and Member Action Team (M.A.T.) leader for AFSCME, UC allegedly employed intimidation tactics against workers at the most recent solidarity strike with UPTE.</p>\n<p>“For example, we had some bosses that were threatening retaliation against workers who went on strikes. Unfortunately, we actually had some violence on the strike lines at Berkeley and Davis campuses, and as far as I know, that hasn’t been denounced by the UC yet,” Coldron said.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2019/01/11/video-shows-alleged-uc-davis-employee-attack-afscme-3299-strikers-in-october/\">altercation</a> between a UC Davis managerial worker and strikers arose when a truck drove close to the picket lines during the three-day strike last fall. A UC Berkeley employee was also tackled to the ground and <a href=\"http://www.dailycal.org/2018/02/01/uc-berkeley-worker-detained-ucpd-uc-worker-rally/\">arrested</a> in a protest in February of last year.</p>\n<p>“We’re just out here to affirm that we have a right to speak and that even if we’re being intimidated, we’re going to make sure that our voices are heard.”</p>\n<p>More than 100 members came out to support AFSCME during the strike today, according to Serafin Zamora, UCSB groundskeeper and executive board member for AFSCME.</p>\n<p>Strikers rallied and marched from Storke Tower to Henley Gate, chanting phrases such as “Whose UC? Our UC!” and held signs that said “Standing Together for a Better UC” and “Where’s Yang?”</p>\n<p>Michael Kile, a fourth-year chemistry major at UCSB, explained that flyers with a FAQ were used to intimidate workers before the May strike. The flyers, sent out by UC, contained questions such as, “Can I be fired for striking?” answered by, “Yes, if it is not a legal strike.”</p>\n<p>“There’s more that they can do to support workers, and they’re not doing it. Instead, they’re being silent and it’s really saddening and frustrating as a student to see this,” said Ana Fabian, a fourth-year student intern for AFSCME.</p>\n<p>“We come to an institution trying to learn more about these issues, but they’re happening right here right now.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

UCSB Advisory Committee, UCSB, the UC Treasury and the UC Regents to withdraw investments from companies that profit off of alleged human rights violations by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was authored by Letters and Science Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno and was student sponsored by Dylan Kupsh and Fatima Abdel-Gwad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early morning vote came down to 10 yeses, 14 noes and 0 abstentions; the decision to hold a secret ballot came at the end of a 10 and a half hour Senate meeting once the senators moved into a formal discussion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, senators vote with verbal or hand signals. A secret ballot allows each senator to anonymously write their vote down on a slip of paper. The slips of paper are then counted by the Internal Vice President (IVP) and A.S. staffers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I respect the vote,” Uribe said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after the meeting ended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bulk of the Wednesday night, Thursday morning meeting was composed of public forum, during which approximately 90 audience members spoke to their opinions about divestment. Throughout the meeting, the audience was relatively split between pro- and anti- divestment stances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the first time the Senate has utilized a secret ballot to vote on divestment since 2015. Both senators and their constituents expressed concern about students being doxxed before they chose to vote with the secret ballot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution to divest was originally </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/a-s-senate-meeting-fails-to-pass-revised-divestment-resolution-with-close-votes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposed back in 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when it failed 12-11-1.

Attorney General Ali Suebert disagreed on whether the resolution was directional or positional, throwing the Senate into a debate that ended with</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 12 senators walking out and never returning.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution later termed out at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/divestment-vote-cancelled-69th-senate-meeting-shut-down-by-civil-disobedience/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">68th Senate’s last meeting.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, current A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi spoke midway through public forum about how, after combing through this year’s resolution specifically, her office concluded that it was directional, meaning that it only needed 50% + 1 votes. If it was considered a positional resolution, it would have required a two-thirds majority to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also clarified the rules regarding abstention votes, and said that senators who abstained would have their votes counted in the majority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution’s student sponsors emphasized that this year’s resolution was not affiliated with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. However, this was a point of contention with several senators at the table, who noted that the resolution referenced BDS resolutions that had passed at other universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several senators – including On-Campus Senator Lea Toubian and proxy Noah Fleishman – left the vote crying. Both had spoken at length during the discussion about their personal experiences with anti-Semitism and how they feel unsafe on campus, noting several anti-Semitic incidents that have occurred in recent weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian and Fleishman both spoke several times through the meeting against the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I firmly believe this resolution provides a platform for hate,” Toubian said around 4 a.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fleishman echoed similar sentiments: “If we go to a secret ballot, understand the safety of the Jewish community is in your hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several senators and public forum speakers called the resolution inherently anti-Semitic and asked what tangible change it would provide for Palestinian students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Christian Ornelas emphasized throughout the meeting that A.S. UCSB had money invested in the companies listed, and public forum speakers and the student sponsors said that they did not want their tuition money to “fund the oppression of Palestinian people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call to divest from A.S. UCSB investments was also the reason why Safadi argued that this year’s resolution was directional, in comparison to previous years, which did not have this specific call to action.</span></p>\n<p>Further coverage can be viewed below:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The vote to pass the divestment resolution failed 10-14-0. <a href=\"https://t.co/SPIkjvOkVi\">pic.twitter.com/SPIkjvOkVi</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus (@dailynexus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1116309213926395905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arturo Martinez and Katherine Swartz contributed reporting</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>Updated [12:33 p.m.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Winter Quarter 2019. <em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>O’Connor and Joanne Nowak, an academic coordinator at the Blum Center, advertised the minor to students at the minor’s first informational meeting on Wednesday afternoon. The meeting was attended by approximately 40 students.</p>\n<p>“I took History 74 with O’Connor. That’s how I first found out about the minor. I was interested in the minor partly because O’Connor is so awesome, but I’m also really interested in the material,” Wessal Esber, a first-year political science major, said.</p>\n<p>Although the minor is part of the Department of History, it will remain affiliated with the Blum Center, a network of organizations created by UC Regent Richard Blum dedicated to addressing global poverty through transdisciplinary and collaborative approaches.</p>\n<p>The Blum Center program first began in the fall of 2007 at UC Berkeley, but has expanded over the past 12 years to every UC campus.</p>\n<p>“The minor in Poverty, Inequality and Democracy is the pillar of the teaching component of the Blum Center. Completing this minor will prepare students to think in critical and informed ways about these issues, laying the foundation for effective action,” Charles Hale, dean of social sciences, said.</p>\n<p>History 74 — Poverty, Inequality, and Social Justice in a Historical and Global Perspective — is one of three core requirements for the minor.</p>\n<p>“The idea is that anyone from any department can take it. They don’t have to know any history, they don’t have to know anything about poverty, they’re there to learn about it from a historical and global perspective,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>After completing History 74, students must complete an internship requirement, which aims to help students apply concepts from the classroom to an organization. The internship can be completed through class 196SJ in the history department, UCDC, UC Sacramento, Education Abroad, a private organization by petition or through another department on campus.</p>\n<p>“The Blum Center is now working on developing internship relationships with organizations in the local community so that we can help students with placements and develop ongoing relationships with the organizations where we’re placing interns,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>“We want it to be a meaningful learning experience for the students, but also a meaningful experience for the organization.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Blum Center will cultivate a list of local internships for students in the minor to help connect them to long-term partner organizations.</p>\n<p>The final core requirement for the minor is a History 174Q, a capstone seminar for students who have completed the coursework and internship to reflect on their experience of the minor through a research paper or artistic project.</p>\n<p>“We want to use the resources of the Blum Center to make the minor a kind of space for people coming from a wide variety of interests from across the campus, from the sciences as well as the humanities and social sciences, who share an interest in this whole set of issues and who come together outside the classroom, outside their internships, to participate in workshops, our pop-up programs,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>In the future, the Blum Center plans to add a fellowship program for the minor’s students who attend and volunteer with the Blum Center programs outside of coursework.</p>\n<p>“I really feel that there’s a lot of energy on this campus for dealing with a whole range of issues that deal with inequality and social justice, not just from the lens of economic need and poverty, but other standpoints as well,” O’Connor added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
