Clinic Building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as they relate to the community. I.V. Community Network meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>DESSERT DAY</strong><br>\nFor those wondering where you can get your hamantaschen fix, look no further than Friendship Manor. Hamantaschen is a triangular cookie or pastry filled with nearly anything, from jellies to cheese to Nutella. This treat is traditionally associated with the Jewish holiday of Purim. The Santa Barbara Hillel invites community members to the Hillel to make hamantaschen with the elderly living at Friendship Manor on Thursday from 2-3:30 p.m. Those interested are urged to RSVP on the Santa Barbara Hillel Facebook page and will receive community service hours.</p>\n<p><strong>NEW COLORS</strong><br>\nUCSB students in the Urban Arts Workshop will unveil a mural from 3:30-5 p.m. Thursday at 6696 Del Playa Drive. The student painters have worked on the mural under artist Gabriel Cardenas since Fall Quarter and will be discussing the process of creating the mural, as well as the impacts murals have in the Isla Vista community. Local businesses will provide food and drinks, and all community members are welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>’ZINE SCENE</strong><br>\n<em>The Catalyst</em> literary magazine will host its quarterly launch party at 6 p.m. on Thursday at Coffee Collaborative. Organizers will be handing out free copies of the magazine’s 10th issue, which includes the prose, poetry and art submissions of UCSB students. Authors will be reading aloud their poetry alongside performances from spoken word artists and local band The Real Savage Henry.</p>\n<p><strong>MEMORIAL GARDEN</strong><br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting at 2 p.m. Friday for upkeep at the Isla Vista Love and Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was created to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014 shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>MEATLESS SUNDAY</strong><br>\nA local organization called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Cafe). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>DEAD WEEK DIY</strong><br>\nA.S. Program Board understands the necessity of coffee as Dead Week rolls around. The organization will be hosting a mug decorating do-it-yourself session from 6:30-8:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Pardall Center. The event will include free snacks, scantrons and mugs. Pro tip: you can study at the same time if you try painting your mug with elements from the periodic table or key terms from your study guide.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in March that 124 UC staff and faculty members were accused of violating Title IX between January 2013 and April 2016. Of the six UCSB staff and faculty accused, all investigations were conducted under old Title IX policy from 2013, according to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UC sexual harassment policy underwent its latest change in January 2016, after UC President Janet Napolitano organized the Task Force in 2014 on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault. The Task Force was comprised of committees dedicated to revising multiple aspects of the policy.</p>\n<p>Title IX is a federal state law ensuring that all students have the opportunity to participate in federally funded educational programs without discrimination based on sex. The law can apply to cases of sexual misconduct and assault and any university-affiliated organization, including sports groups and admissions.</p>\n<p>Of the six UCSB investigations, one faculty member received a salary reduction, and the university required another to attend sexual harassment training and personal counseling. Two cases ended with the termination of an employee.</p>\n<p>In other cases, the Title IX office substantiated the claims, but the university took no further disciplinary action as far as documents show.</p>\n<p>Estrada said in an email that it is “too speculative” to conclude if these case investigations would have resulted differently under the 2016 policy revisions.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Salvaty, the UC Title IX coordinator, also said she could not know if an outcome of a case would have been different under the revised policy, but she said the new policy changes would improve Title IX for future cases.</p>\n<p>“I can say that the current policy, and the recommended changes the campuses are implementing, have strengthened the University’s processes and procedures,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76141\" style=\"width: 908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76141\" data-attachment-id=\"76141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/title-ix-graphic-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=898%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"title ix graphic 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=888%2C421&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76141\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=888%2C421\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=768%2C364&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Adjustments made to the policy did, however, alter the way the UC investigates student and employee cases.</p>\n<p>According to Salvaty, under the new policy, Title IX officers review student-on-student sexual violence claims under the same procedures across all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Employee-related cases also underwent “important provisions,” including the requirements that investigations must be concluded within 60 days, both the complainant and the respondent must be notified of the investigation’s outcome and the complainant must be informed of the repercussions imposed on the respondent.</p>\n<p>“Those are some big changes that come to mind,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>While Salvaty could not speak about specific cases, she said cases reviewed under the older policy could not be reconsidered a second time, even though policies have changed.</p>\n<p>“I assume that if a matter was investigated and adjudicated under a then existing process, it could not be investigated again under a new process,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>Salvaty said, however, that consequences for violators may differ depending on each university because decisions on penalties are decided upon by the supervisors of each case at the university, not the Title IX officers and investigators.</p>\n<p>This can result in varied forms of punishment for UC staff and faculty members.</p>\n<p>The UCOP Task Force recommended that each UC campus increase sexual harassment and assault training amongst staff and faculty and create a Campus, Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) Advocate on each campus to help survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment, which UCSB has instated. They also recommend the development of a campus Peer Review Committee to review final investigation reports and advise the chancellor on disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>The UC campuses are currently in the process of implementing all the Task Force’s recommendations.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/","id":2415,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2414,2413,2412],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"George Thurlow Joins CSD on First Day of Business","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"The CSD held its first public meeting on Tuesday in which the Board elected officers, established three new committees and addressed an open forum of community members.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Decades of self-governance movements culminated in a six-hour gathering at the Isla Vista Community Room this Tuesday evening when the I.V.

There’s a reason why the structure of the CSD is set up the way that it is with elected representatives,” Freeman told the <em>Nexus</em> after the meeting Tuesday. “The university has committed funds, but only for seven years, but then they will continue to have this representation essentially forever.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76283\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76283\" data-attachment-id=\"76283\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/csd-first-day-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CSD First Day-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76283\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76283\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A crowd fills the Isla Vista Community Room for the CSD meeting. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Freeman said while he had hoped for a more independent district, UCSB is currently the only funding source for the CSD, meaning that the district should look to work together with the university in order to complete projects beneficial to both residents and students.</p>\n<p>“Because the only person who has put money into this right now is the university, it’s a matter of working with the university and figuring how to find things in Isla Vista that they would be interested in funding,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Director Bertrand said it is important to recognize that elected I.V. residents still hold a majority on the board and said he believes the appointees are great choices.</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve ended up with excellent appointees,” Bertrand said. “I think it’s important that we look to them as allies and also recognize that the majority of the members are residents of I.V. who were publicly elected.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76285\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76285\" data-attachment-id=\"76285\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/csd-first-day-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CSD First Day-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76285\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76285\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Director Ethan Bertrand (left) was named president of the Board of Directors.

I like George. I like Bob. I’m glad that those are the two people who are appointed. I just, I had a dream of a more separate district,” Freeman said. “The appointment process allows leniency for people who weren’t even in Isla Vista on the district, and we’re lucky to have people like Bob Geis who has been around here for a long, long time, but who knows what could happen.”</p>\n<p>As for the university’s role in I.V. through the CSD, Director Thurlow said Chancellor Yang is focused on improving the area.</p>\n<p>“He is incredibly interested in making Isla Vista better,” Thurlow said. “It’s a priority for him.”</p>\n<p>Thurlow said he plans to work, in the short term, on an internship program for UCSB students to work directly with the CSD.

She said Anthony Tsang saved up his allowance to buy her a stuffed animal panda that she wanted for her sixth birthday.</p>\n<p>“He remembered that I wanted it, and he went back to buy it for me,” she said. “So it’s just like little things that I didn’t really think about at the time but now when I go back, it just really matters to me.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang also said her brother was incredibly selfless and always looking out for others.</p>\n<p>“After he passed away, a bunch of his friends came out with stories about him and a lot of things he did, I never knew about, and a lot of us never knew about, that showed how selfless he was,” she said.</p>\n<p>Michelle Lew, Tony’s fiancée, said they did everything together.</p>\n<p>“He was my best friend, the one I shared everything with,” Lew said. “Since the day we met, for two years, we only spent maybe a total of five nights apart.”</p>\n<p>Lew said Anthony could brighten anyone’s day and was able to connect with those around him through his diverse interests and cheerful personality.</p>\n<p>“He was really, for lack of a better word, goofy. He was always messing around, always the silly one, trying to make people laugh,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>Lew and Anthony Tsang lived in Santa Barbara together after meeting on Tinder in San Jose two years ago. They owned two Jack-Russell-Chihuahua mixes and enjoyed going to Arroyo Burro Beach together with their dogs.</p>\n<p>“The big thing that stuck out was how we met, because we actually met on Tinder. So that was a one-in-a-million thing,” Lew said. “The first thing that he messaged me was a pick up line, which was: ‘I’m looking for my next wife on Tinder.’”</p>\n<p>Lew said a year after they met, they were engaged and planned to marry after they finished college.</p>\n<p>“Everything just fit together by random chance,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>In high school, Anthony Tsang was on the cross country team with his friend, Jonathan Wyatt. The two were friends all throughout high school.</p>\n<p>Wyatt described Anthony Tsang as “curious and mischievous … but also extremely charismatic and caring for other people.”</p>\n<p>“It was quite an interesting combination … but it honestly made him a really fun person, and I enjoyed spending a lot of time with him,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang was always getting into trouble in high school and said once he and Anthony Tsang attempted to steal an old computer out of a shed on the high school campus.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said even though the scheme was his idea, Anthony Tsang took most of the blame after they were caught.</p>\n<p>“It was the most ridiculous thing ever, so funny,” Wyatt said. “And Tony was like, man, this always happens to me.” It was great, and honestly I’d give anything just to relive those days again.”</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang’s other friends would describe him as “someone you could count on, no matter what it was.”</p>\n<p>“I think the fact that we could always count on him really was like one of the bigger takeaways from his personality because no matter what situation you were in … he wasn’t really one to judge people,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt also said he admired Anthony Tsang’s adventurous personality, which made a “huge impact” on his own high school experience.</p>\n<p>“He never really had a stop button. It was always go go go,” Wyatt said. “It was very different from how most people live their life, I feel.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother wanted to be a U.S. ambassador to Mexico because he “really loved it.”</p>\n<p>He traveled to Mexico on vacation multiple times with Lew, and Anthony Tsang said he loved how “nice” and “chill” everyone was there.</p>\n<p>According to Lew, Anthony Tsang was a “big beer enthusiast,” which she said might have contributed to his love of Mexico.</p>\n<p>“He liked … just how everyone is so easygoing,” Lew said. “He liked just sitting on the beach and going in the ocean. He liked how friendly everyone was, just something about Mexico’s culture … he was comfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Lew and her fiancé traveled to Canada, Las Vegas and Mexico together. They planned to visit Hawaii and backpack through Europe.</p>\n<p>Anthony Tsang enjoyed listening to EDM, country and indie rock music and was a Dallas basketball and football fan. He liked to draw and snowboard and loved cars, especially Porsches.</p>\n<p>“A couple weeks ago, we went to Porsche, and he was super excited because he got to test drive one,” Lew said. “We went back two days later for me to test drive cars, but then he test drove it again.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother was always willing to try new things and lived a carefree life.</p>\n<p>“He always wanted to experience life as much as possible, and I know it sounds really cheesy, but that’s honestly just the kind of person he was,” Tiana Tsang said. “And one thing that I really say is that, like, he really lived more life in his 23 years than some people do in their whole entire lives.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/","id":2414,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2413,2412,2411],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings-On in I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"FNL Improvability will ditch the improv this Friday and perform scripted sketches in Embarcadero Hall during their 8 p.m. show.

Four of six cases at UCSB were reported by students, and the remaining were reported by UC staff.</p>\n<p>The only full-time professor named in UCSB documents was Gurinder Singh Mann, a professor of global studies.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a complaint in May 2013 from a female student alleging that Mann acted inappropriately with sexual conduct, both verbal and physical, during a research discussion meeting at Mann’s home.</p>\n<p>Mann retired in 2015 but was a professor at the time of the investigation, which began in May 2013.</p>\n<p>According to the documents, the female complainant said Mann asked her to sit on his bed with him and proceeded to lay beside her. While sitting on the bed, Mann allegedly touched her neck and chest around the area of her collarbone.</p>\n<p>She said he inserted his hand inside her shirt, touched her stomach and put his face near to hers. When she confronted him, he responded that “he’s not a dirty old man, that, for him, what he had done was just like petting his cat.”</p>\n<p>The student later wrote an email to Mann saying, “this really was extremely uncomfortable for me, I still have nightmares about it.” She also alleged that Mann, on several occasions, would rub her arm, shoulder and thigh.</p>\n<p>In the Title IX report, Mann denied all allegations of harassment and said his primary aim was establishing a Santa Barbara school of Sikh studies, not “playing with young people in any way.”</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the Title IX office concluded in August 2013 that all such claims “more likely than not did occur” and that Mann had violated the UC’s sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>The documents do not indicate actions taken by the university, and Mann has since been a guest lecturer at UCSB after his retirement.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in May 2014 claiming that former music department lecturer Paul Sahuc allegedly sexually harassed a former music department graduate student.</p>\n<p>The female subject claimed that Sahuc had said on multiple occasions, “Are you on your period?” during lessons. She also stated that he repeatedly walked into the women’s dressing room unannounced while people were changing.</p>\n<p>According to the documents, several other witnesses offered information illustrating patterns of sexualized comments from Sahuc.</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the UCSB Title IX office concluded that the alleged conduct “more likely than not did occur,” and that both allegations violated sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76156\" style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76156\" data-attachment-id=\"76156\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2-27-10-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=465%2C531&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"465,531\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen shot 2017-03-02 at 2.27.10 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=465%2C531&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76156\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?resize=465%2C531\" alt=\"\" width=\"465\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?w=465&amp;ssl=1 465w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?resize=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As a result, the music department declined to renew Sahuc’s employment contract, effectively terminating his university employment.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office also received a report in April 2013 alleging that Facilities Management laborer Cresenciano Marin sexually harassed a senior custodian.</p>\n<p>The female subject had previously complained to her supervisors about Marin’s conduct, but she received no resolution. A formal investigation began in April 2013.</p>\n<p>As detailed in the documents, the complainant said while riding in an elevator together during their shift, Marin came up behind her as she bent down and put his hand on her back without her consent and made gestures “as to mock a sexual position.” After she told him he was being inappropriate, he responded that he would find her later and “violate/rape” her.</p>\n<p>The complainant said Marin told her on several other occasions that she should “suck his dick,” asked her the color of her underwear and asked if the color of her pubic hair was the same color as the hair on her head.</p>\n<p>The investigation also found that on an unknown date, coworkers found pornographic videos and newspaper clippings of the <em>Nexus</em>’ “Wednesday Hump” as well as “December 2006 Playboy Magazine Digital Edition” in his cleaning closet.</p>\n<p>Marin denied all such claims, but the Title IX office substantiated all 11 sexual harassment claims against him. The university terminated his employment in July 2013 following the findings of the investigation.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in April 2015 that a UCPD supervisor allegedly sexually harassed his female employee during an after-hours celebration at American Ale in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the male subject went to hug his employee and “grabbed her breast,” to which she “stood stupefied” and didn’t say anything. She went to push him away, but he “grabbed her face and stuck his tongue down her throat.” When she turned back around, he tried to hug her and “bit her neck, leaving a mark.”</p>\n<p>The documents report that, when the female returned to the outdoor seating area, she informed the group that she was attacked. A witness reported to the Title IX office that the same male had “pinched his/her buttocks earlier that night.”</p>\n<p>The male subject claimed he “blacked out” the night of the incident and could not respond to the allegations because he could not remember.</p>\n<p>At the time of the allegation, he was working half-time in his department, and he became a full-time employee in July 2015.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, UCSB required the male subject to complete the university’s online sexual harassment prevention training and attend personal counseling.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in November 2015 that a music department lecturer allegedly sexually harassed a former music department student.</p>\n<p>The student claimed she was harassed through verbal conduct during piano lessons and that the male subject would comment on other women, saying “so-and-so’s boobs are hanging out,” “so-and-so’s ass cheeks are hanging out” and “women are provocative, and the things they wear seduce men, and it’s no wonder that all these women get raped.”</p>\n<p>Another complainant said the music lecturer would tell her sexualized comments he made to other students like, “If this composer was here, he’d want to seduce you.”</p>\n<p>The male subject denied the allegations against him, but the Title IX office concluded that the conduct “more likely than not did occur” and that the music lecturer had violated UC sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, the male subject received a 10 percent salary reduction and a written censure.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office also received a report that a faculty member from the global studies department allegedly sexually harassed a fourth-year undergraduate student.</p>\n<p>According to the female complainant, the male faculty member made jokes promoting rape culture that had no relevance to the class. The jokes were, “What was the wife’s favorite sex position? Facing Nordstrom’s.” and “Why were the sorority girls disappointed about being gang-raped? Because they had to write so many thank-you cards.”</p>\n<p>The female complainant spoke out during lecture, saying that he was being inappropriate. The female subject dropped the global studies class that same day due to the “sexist classroom climate.”</p>\n<p>She stated in her interview with the Title IX office that she could not concentrate for the remainder of the class because she was so upset by his comments. When asked what resolutions she sought through the process, she said that she did not believe the male subject should be teaching at the university.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the male faculty member wrote through his attorney that he did not use the words “the wife,” “raped” or “sororities,” but admitted the jokes were made in poor taste.</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the Title IX office substantiated one of the three sexual harassment claims against the faculty member. The documents do not indicate whether the university took further disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the university investigated and adjudicated all of the UCSB cases under policies and processes that have since been updated.</p>\n<p>“Over the past two and a half years, UC has taken steps to significantly change — and improve — the ways such cases are handled,” she said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> also obtained the Title IX documents of eight other campuses — UC Merced, UC Los Angeles, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Irvine and UC San Diego — and is currently sorting through them to determine further details.</p>\n<p>Although UC Berkeley has not yet sent in its documents, the <em>Daily Cal</em> provided the number of sexual misconduct cases listed for its campus.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

evacuate following further cliff erosion caused by recent storms. All 20 residents at 6757 opted to move out and search for new homes. Anthony Lai / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following a storm last week that quickened the erosion of Isla Vista’s bluffs, the county ordered three residents to evacuate their ocean side bedrooms on the upper and lower units of 6757 Del Playa Drive. All 20 residents of the building decided to leave in search of new housing.</p>\n<p>Olivia Haney, a third-year chemistry major who resided at 6757 Del Playa Drive, said students from the upstairs unit are moving into university housing at San Clemente Villages and Sierra Madre Villages. Other downstairs residents like herself have relocated to housing along Trigo Road, and the rest remain in the building until they can find a new place to live.</p>\n<p>“It’s sad we had to break up the house, because we all became very close, but I’m happy with the decision,” Haney said. “I wanted to be safe rather than sorry, so I’m happy I am still able to be with my friends even if it’s not in ’57.”</p>\n<p>A month before the order to vacate two ocean side bedrooms on 6757 Del Playa Drive, a cliffside balcony collapse on 6653 Del Playa Drive forced 28 students to find new housing.</p>\n<p>Nina Karr, a third-year biology major, said tenants from 6653 have moved to housing at Sueno Road, Trigo Road and downtown Santa Barbara. She currently resides on Sueno and said Del Playa was a good street to live on because it is well lit and filled with people.</p>\n<p>“The further you go away from DP, it gets a little sketchier, not that I feel unsafe, but I definitely felt a little safer on DP,” Karr said. “But Sueno is definitely nice; our apartment’s really nice. I would say the only problem is that it’s not in Goleta.”</p>\n<p>According to Debbie Fleming, the assistant vice chancellor for student affairs, there was a coordinated effort between the Associated Students Pardall Center, Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), Community Housing Office, Housing &amp; Residential Services, A.S. Legal Services, the Dean of Students Office and property manager Wolfe &amp; Associates to provide assistance to the displaced UCSB students of 6757 Del Playa Drive. Santa Barbara City College was also able to support its students.</p>\n<p>“Because we had the experience of going through this before, we were better prepared to quickly respond and organize a group meeting to offer assistance,” Fleming said in an email, referring to the balcony collapse in January.</p>\n<p>Following the balcony collapse, IVTU has been working with departments across the university and county to establish a protocol for a clear line of communication between the students and these entities. According to Diana Puente, the A.S. Isla Vista community advisor, it can be challenging for the university to provide support for students because many of the properties in Isla Vista are private, so the flow of communication is not yet established.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76136\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76136\" data-attachment-id=\"76136\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/students-search-for-housing-after-dp-evacuations/clifffall_v2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?fit=1868%2C1129&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1868,1129\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CliffFall_V2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?fit=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?fit=888%2C537&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-76136\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2-1024x619.jpg?resize=888%2C537\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"537\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?resize=1024%2C619&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?resize=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?resize=768%2C464&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?w=1868&amp;ssl=1 1868w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76136\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Soham Tikekar / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“We just kind of saw a really significant need,” Puente said. “So that would mean, once there is information that comes out about an event that has happened in Isla Vista, to be able to gather all the folks together to be able to determine what different services each group can provide.”</p>\n<p>IVTU chair Daniel Renteria added that part of the board’s decision was to collaborate with different organizations and create a community fund for non-UCSB students in a housing crisis.</p>\n<p>“Because of our student fees, our money couldn’t go to these three non-UCSB students that were affected,” Renteria said. “So I think in light of this, it just came out about what more can we do for the community.”</p>\n<p>Karen Kurpershoek, student coordinator at A.S. Food Bank, said IVTU partnered with her organization to provide food packages for affected students. They also helped refer the displaced students to academic advising, housing, financial aid and emergency loans.</p>\n<p>“So, if something does happen with the storm or housing or whatever it may be, if someone needs to reach out and get immediate assistance, we can provide that for them,” Kurpershoek said.</p>\n<p>Some of the displaced students who have secured housing now see Del Playa Drive in a different light.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely scary,” Karr said. “The rain, especially today [Feb. 17] was insane, and I’ve been thinking to myself, like ,I’m happy I’m not living there anymore because this potentially could cause a lot more damage, so I’m kind of grateful we got out of that situation.”</p>\n<p>Emma Holtzapple, a fourth-year environmental studies major who was able to stay in her part of the building on 6653 Del Playa Drive, said it was strange to no longer have the portion of the balcony even if she knows the cliff is officially stable.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people look forward to living oceanside DP their senior year and having that balcony to enjoy and even the safety that comes along with that,” Holtzapple said. “That was all taken away from us.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of

id=\"caption-attachment-76068\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors met to discuss the extension of a festival ordinance to include this year’s Deltopia. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill would extend the ordinance from its current dates, which do not cover this year’s Deltopia. On the listed dates, the Santa Barbara County Code prohibits outdoor festivals or any similar musical activity, defined as music played at any location not built exclusively for that purpose such as a concert hall or music venue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current law sets an ordinance on April 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 and Oct. 26 through Nov. 4, but it does not cover this year’s Deltopia weekend, which will take place April 7, 8 and 9.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amendment to the ordinance was initially proposed by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office on Feb. 14 and would extend the days to include this year’s Deltopia as well as the following six years’ celebrations, including Halloween.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Supervisors meeting next week will determine the adoption of the bill. Board members must vote to pass the amendment, though it is likely to pass as all five members of the board voted in favor of setting the date for the hearing at Tuesday’s meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commander Kelly Moore of the Sheriff’s office spoke at the board meeting to discuss the amendment and said the previous two years’ Deltopia events saw much smaller crowds as a result of the festival ordinance. Commander Moore said the 2015 crowd was approximated to be 10,000 and the 2016 crowd was near 3,500, compared to 2014’s estimated 20,000 to 25,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several I.V. community members also spoke at the meeting, including I.V. Community Services District Director-elect Spencer Brandt, who said the festival ordinance is flawed but continues to be useful to law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The festival ordinance is an integral tool for the Sheriff’s Office and other partnering law enforcement agencies to make use of,” Brandt said. “While it is an imperfect solution, I see no reason why this policy shouldn’t be continued this year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Senate passed a resolution last week articulating the Senate’s position in favor of the amendment to the ordinance dates. Senator Batsheva Stoll, who authored the resolution, spoke at the board meeting to reiterate the Senate’s view on the ordinance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re in support of the ordinance as long as it’s being enforced on the day of Deltopia,” she said. “We want to make sure that, when it’s being enforced, it’s being enforced fairly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stoll said law enforcement’s presence at Deltopia could be a point of misunderstanding for students and stressed that police should work with campus organizations like UCIV to minimize potential conflict. UCIV is a volunteer organization at UC Santa Barbara that warns residents when they might be violating ordinances, connects students with medical services when needed and hands out free condoms and water during Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time, there can be miscommunications with students and law enforcement, so we urge [law enforcement] to work with organizations like UCIV that volunteer to help students understand the law and kind of work as sort of a middleman to ensure that everything runs smoothly on Deltopia,” Stoll said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Her bills address various social issues and changes in criminal trial laws.</p>\n<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 55</strong>: This bill proposes to indefinitely extend the Distinguished After School Health (D.A.S.H.) Recognition Program, which ensures that after school programs provide healthy food and drinks for their attendees and include physical activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 169</strong>: Through this bill, Jackson aims to fortify the power of Title IX, a law that students use to protect themselves from sexual discrimination and violence, by making the protections and requirements of Title IX and the role of educational institutions clearer.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 203</strong>: This bill would allow for more development in technology education, including media literacy and internet safety in public schools and would require administrators to review the policies and procedures of these programs.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 331</strong>: In instances of domestic violence, this bill would add public or private universities and colleges to the definition of “domestic violence victim service organizations,” which would extend the aid that nongovernment organizations receive to support victims of domestic violence</p>\n<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 44</strong>: In response to the damage caused by abandoned oil wells, Jackson hopes this bill would help financially support a coastal hazard and legacy oil and gas wells removal and remediation program.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 212</strong>: This bill aims to extend the definition of “medical waste” to include medical waste generated in households, making such waste applicable to the Medical Waste Management Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 224</strong>: This bill would prevent the lead agencies of the California Environmental Quality Act from directly establishing the conditions of a project that may harm the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 290</strong>: With the acquisition of funds, this bill would help establish rehabilitation centers for injured marine animals and would allow the Department of Fish and Wildlife to work with nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 465:</strong> This bill aims to make changes to how the supervisors of abandoned oil wells report their findings.</p>\n<p><strong>EMPLOYEE RIGHTS</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 62:</strong> Under current law, an employee is able to take up to 12 weeks off to bond with their child, take care for a sick child, parent or spouse and take time off if they are suffering from a serious health issue. This bill would broaden the definition an employee’s “child,” erase the age restriction and would allow the employee to take time off to take care of an ill grandparent, grandchild, sibling, domestic partner and a parent-in-law.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 63:</strong> This bill would make it illegal for employers to prohibit an employee from receiving a 12-week parental leave with health benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 327</strong>: This bill proposes to make changes to the way a business removes customers’ personal information to protect their privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SR 9</strong>: This bill aims to ensure that Planned Parenthood in California retains its current funding and continues to support women’s rights and health care.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 309:</strong> This bill would allow the State Department of Health Care Services to sponsor a license plate design that shows support of pro-choice reproductive rights. The proceeds made from these license plates would go to the California Reproductive Freedom Fund to support the Family Planning, Access, Care and Treatment program.</p>\n<p><strong>CHANGES IN CRIMINAL TRIAL</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 670</strong>: In the case where a person has more than one felony in different counties, this bill aims to clarify that the judicial council must decide in which county the felon should have his or her trial.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 725</strong>: This bill proposes to extend the definition of a misdemeanor to include DUIs so that people with a DUI misdemeanor can be placed in a pretrial diversion program to receive treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>LEGISLATIVE ADJUSTMENTS</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 347</strong>: This bill aims to make various changes to the way remote controlled aircrafts, most commonly known as drones, are used, including adding liability insurance to people operating the remote piloted aircraft.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 188</strong>: The Emergency Management Assistance Compact allows states to help each other out in instances of emergencies and disasters. This bill would extend the use of this law until 2023.<br>\nMeasure SB 36: This bill would maintain the $315 fee that active lawyers pay to the State Bar of California for membership.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 387:</strong> Under this bill, the fines imposed by the False Claims Act would be adjusted with the levels of inflation so the money collected would remain effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 690</strong>: This bill would allow for the applicant‘s information received by the State Bar of California to be public, including their names.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75941\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/from-environment-to-education-calif-senate-to-review-new-bills/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75941\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/from-environment-to-education-calif-senate-to-review-new-bills/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/from-environment-to-education-calif-senate-to-review-new-bills/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/from-environment-to-education-calif-senate-to-review-new-bills/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/from-environment-to-education-calif-senate-to-review-new-bills/","id":3918,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[3917,3916,3915],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rep.

Senator Alex Giolito last week prompted county officials to come sooner.</p>\n<p>The petition calls for the termination of the project and urges alternative methods of controlling the intersection’s traffic flow to be considered.</p>\n<p>“I know they spent a lot of work on it and appreciate them addressing the current solution, but I believe alternatives can still be reached,” Giolito said.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Giolito said the signal would stop hundreds of bikes during rush hour and thus “clog” the intersection.</p>\n<p>McKarrell said Isla Vista Foot Patrol recognized the intense volume of traffic at the Pardall intersection almost a decade ago in 1998. However, it was not until 2007 that possible solutions were discussed. In 2013, county officials proposed the idea of a traffic signal.</p>\n<p>“I think it will actually help the bikes and pedestrians to all get through, and people will always know who has the right of way,” McGolpin said.</p>\n<p>Bert Johnson emphasized the simplicity of the traffic light’s design, noting that the signal would include an additional mast arm clearly visible to bikers so they will be able to see the signal before arriving at the intersection.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Giolito asked if county officials had considered the possibility of cars speeding on the six-and-a-half-block stretch of Embarcadero Del Norte, from Embarcadero Hall to Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>Johnson said the Santa Barbara Public Works Department has found that car speeds average around 29 miles per hour. He added that after the signal is installed, they will test the speeds again to ensure they do not exceed the 30-mile-per-hour range.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator Aaron Hendizadeh asked the officials about how the new traffic light would be enforced.</p>\n<p>According to McKarrell, the I.V. Foot Patrol will initially implement a warning period for people who do not abide by the new traffic light. He said after a certain period of time, if people do not adhere to the signal, then enforcement will begin.</p>\n<p>McKarrell added, however, that the most important aspect of enforcing the signal is the safety of pedestrians and bikers at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“The only tools we have are educating the community on how to be safe and the other is enforcement,” McKarrell said. “The officers don’t want to come out here and start handing out citations. We have matters that are much more serious, but it is your safety that’s paramount.”</p>\n<p>The officials addressed alternative solutions to the signal, such as additional bike lanes in I.V. or funneling bike traffic more evenly to and from campus from I.V.; however, all of these solutions were “too multilayered” to be deemed feasible.</p>\n<p>The officials suggested future discussions about the traffic signal closer to the beginning of the signal’s construction.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly named A.S.

county residents, now holds 82,011 acre-feet of water — a significant increase from the 34,576 acre-feet it held last Wednesday. This still accounts for less than half of the lake’s maximum storage: 193,305 acre-feet.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Flood Control District reported that the lake was at 17.9 percent capacity last week and at 7.3 percent capacity on Oct. 1 of last year.</p>\n<p>In light of the six-year statewide drought, the United States Bureau of Reclamation said in October 2015 that the Goleta Water District should “expect no new water from the lake.”</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District declared mandatory water use restrictions in May 2015 when it declared a Stage III Water Shortage Emergency with plans to reduce water usage by 35 percent across the district.</p>\n<p>This type of emergency is declared when the district’s water supply is 65 to 75 percent what it should normally be at that time of the year.</p>\n<p>Drought conditions may improve with recent rainfall, as Santa Barbara County is among the regions most affected by the recent drought period.</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties are the only areas still in an extreme drought stage, referred to as D3. The rest of the state is mostly in abnormally dry conditions, D0, with a large portion of Northern California no longer in drought.</p>\n<p>It is possible that Santa Barbara County could be lifted out of D3 range after last week’s rain spells.</p>\n<p>While the rain could offset the county’s drought, it also may cause potential infrastructure problems, as last week’s storm resulted in sinkholes, mudslides and severe flooding.</p>\n<p>Tom Fayram, deputy director of Water Resources at the Public Works Department in the county, said he is not concerned about the infrastructure at Cachuma Dam but recognized that last week’s intense rain could cause problems for roadways and flood control systems.</p>\n<p>“I have no concern over Cachuma Dam,” Fayram said. “If we get future rainfall of the magnitude of the rain we got just before last weekend, then we do have serious infrastructure concerns in terms of our transportation system, our roadways, our flood control system, [and] in terms of our channels and basins that do tend to be stressed in storms like that.”</p>\n<p>Fayram, whose department works in contracting the water from Lake Cachuma, said last week’s rains greatly contributed to the reservoir’s water supply, which will provide water to the entire south coast including Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“We still don’t know yet how much water actually will be available out of this,” Fayram said.  “There [are] a number of factors that go into it, but clearly this was a welcome shot in the arm, so to speak, of water that we just haven’t seen for the last five years.”</p>\n<p>As for how this rainfall will affect water restrictions in Goleta, KK Holland from the Goleta Water District said she is “cautiously optimistic” given the recent storm activity.</p>\n<p>“The Board is not currently considering additional restrictions,” Holland said in an email.<br>\nFayram said he welcomes the rain and capacity increase, but long-term solutions are necessary to solve the drought problem.</p>\n<p>“We still have a lake that’s at 50 percent capacity and can go back down to the same conditions we were in before,” Fayram said. “I don’t think that even filling the lake completely would solve our water supply issues because we started off with a lake in 2011 completely full, and five years of drought put us into a very dire situation.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Tenants Union (IVTU) spoke during the open forum about students displaced from Del Playa due to the cliff erosion. They have created a $15,000 emergency fund and asked Senate to match these funds to ensure that students have access to new housing, financial support, moving support and legal assistance.</p>\n<p>Senate voted to pass a resolution to match this funding, giving up to $300 per displaced UCSB student. SBCC students will not be eligible.</p>\n<p>IVTU is also creating an emergency protocol to ensure that students’ needs are met and that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Senate also approved a resolution on the “festival ordinance” in relation to Deltopia, changing the dates of the ordinance to include April 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The bill also aims to increase the role of the external vice president of local affairs in the discussion of the ordinance and open communication between the community and the police.</p>\n<p>They also voted on a resolution regarding advertisements aired on social media discouraging students from coming to I.V. to attend Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Senator Cole Marting expressed concern about a lack of public data about the effectiveness of the advertising and added a stipulation to the resolution asking that the university provide Senate with data.</p>\n<p>The resolution passed with 19 senators in support. Senator Ashley Selki abstained.</p>\n<p>As for items discussed, the meeting began with a statement from Gina Fischer, a representative for Third District County Supervisor Joan Hartmann, about the installation of traffic light at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte.</p>\n<p>Senator Batsheva Stoll expressed concern over the 10 minute intervals between classes when students rush through Pardall, and whether timing on the street lights might affect this.</p>\n<p>“We watch it and make minor tweaks to it to make it run as efficiently as possible,” Scott McGolpin, Santa Barbara public works director, said.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed law enforcement at the stoplight.</p>\n<p>Stoll said “people will be angry with a $200 traffic ticket,” but Deputy James McKarrell said there would first be an educational period ensuring that students understand proper safety, followed by a probationary period with heavy police presence to give out warnings to students who did not obey the light.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t see a change, then we will have an enforcement period,” McKarrell said. “My job is not to necessarily be out here and have you like me; it’s to make sure you get home to your parents.”</p>\n<p>There was also a discussion regarding anti-Semitism that was discussed during the last Senate meeting, with Jack Tannenbaum, third-year economics major, expressing extreme disapproval of the way Senate handled a discussion about anti-Semitism during last week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s a right of any minority group to define what hate against themselves is,” he said. “It’s extremely inappropriate to diminish harm students are feeling because it’s late at night.”</p>\n<p>Senators all expressed their support. Senator Marting said he had taken the time to fully understand anti-Semitism, and Natalie Jordan said they would consider doing more trainings to help further understanding.</p>\n<p>The meeting concluded with a statement by Steven Kwok, director of legislative accountability, expressing his disappointment in the lack of engagement by senators with BCUs.</p>\n<p>“I do want to stress how important your presence at meetings is,” he said. “There are a lot of people doing work out there, and I’m not sure how much you know about it.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
