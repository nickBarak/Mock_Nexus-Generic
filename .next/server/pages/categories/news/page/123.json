CAB’s visit was prompted by the wake of violent protests sparked by the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August of last year.  </p>\n<p>Third-year political science and philosophy double major major and Alternative Breaks co-coordinator coordinator Jeremiah Copeland said the event was entirely different from other CAB events he has attended due to its social justice focus and level of personal engagement with local community members. </p>\n<p>“I thought that the trip was very powerful and a great experience,” Copeland said. “The social justice aspect of the trip was something completely different than CAB has ever really done before, so it was a refreshing experience.” </p>\n<p>Copeland said he has been on other alternative spring breaks, but this trip was more focused on social justice work and remolding systems of power for positive change. </p>\n<p>“I have been on an alternative break to Colorado for flood relief and Oakland to work with foster youth and at food banks,” Copeland said. “Those were more volunteer oriented, and this Ferguson trip was more learning about the multitude of issues that are affecting the area and what we can do to help.” </p>\n<p>Copeland also said the alleged presence of racism in law enforcement in the nation is an issue that must be dealt with on a local and federal level. </p>\n<p>“I think that the Michael Brown case has brought to bright light the racism that is present in many police departments across the nation. It must be stopped,” Copeland said. </p>\n<p>CAB member and first-year Xuewen Sherry Li said the said the situation in Ferguson was upsetting but sparked a vital impetus change in the nation.  </p>\n<p>“It’s sad that this many lives had to end before the silence was broken, but I think awareness and solidarity has brought people from all across the country together,” Li said. </p>\n<p>According to Li, the trip was an impactful experience for her and for all Gaucho participants. </p>\n<p>“It was absolutely amazing, this trip has made me realize that I don’t have to get on a plane to make an impact,” Li said. “All around me are breaches that can be fixed and voices to fight for.”<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Hall.<em> Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Navy Sea, Air, Land Teams (SEAL) soldier and best-selling author Eric Greitens spoke at Campbell Hall on Thursday night on his recently released book<em> Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life</em>, a compilation of 23 letters between Greitens and a former SEAL comrade who was struggling with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>\n<p>Greitens, who was awarded the United States Armed Forces Bronze Star and listed on <em>Fortune</em> magazine’s World’s 50 Greatest Leaders in 2014 and<em> Time</em> magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in 2013, spoke to a crowd of approximately 250 students, faculty, community members and Arts &amp; Lectures donors. Greitens is also a Rhodes Scholar, a White House Fellow and founder and CEO of The Mission Continues, a non-profit organization which challenges veterans to serve and lead in communities across the country.</p>\n<p>Throughout the lecture, Greitens focused on how to grow from personal experiences, stating that growth is necessary to move on from past hardship.</p>\n<p>“You cannot bounce back from hardship. You can only move through it,” Greitens said. “No one escapes pain, fear, and suffering. Yet from pain can come wisdom; from fear can come courage; and from suffering can come strength — if we have the value of resilience.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through – Eric Greitens</p></blockquote>\n<p>Greitens also discussed the importance of meeting obstacles in order to progress in life and said that, as Navy SEALS, he and his colleagues understood the word “frontline” to mean “the place where we met the enemy,” but frontline is not just a “military term.”</p>\n<p>“In fact, you have a frontline in your life now,” Greitans said. “Everyone has a place where they encounter fear, where they struggle, suffer, and face hardship. … It is on the frontline of our lives that we earn wisdom, create joy, forge friendships, discover happiness, find love and do purposeful work.”</p>\n<p>According to Greitens, the most important factor in dealing with hardship is figuring out to work through life’s challenges.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a place in life where they have to deal with hardship and challenge and pain and difficulty fear,” Greitens said. “But it’s often our ability to navigate those places — of hardship and difficulty — that grow essential to our ability to live life in a purpose, productive and meaningful way.”</p>\n<p>Greitens said he believes resilience is a way of working through hardship rather than returning to a state of being prior to experiencing hardship.</p>\n<p>“When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through,” Greitens said. “Resilient people do not bounce back from hard experiences. They find healthy ways to integrate them into their lives. In time, people can confront great calamity with great spirit and can create great strength.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major at Golden West College in Huntington Beach Nick Wolfe said he traveled to Goleta, CA., from Anaheim to hear Greitens speak.</p>\n<p>“I’m a fan of his work,” Wolfe said. “I’ve read his past book <em>The Heart and The Fis</em>t and I’ve acquired his other book, which is pretty similar.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience. But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. – Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wolfe said he was considering joining the military before he sustained a personal injury, but still enjoys learning about Greitens’ military career.</p>\n<p>“I’ve read the book already and some of the things he did say were verbatim,” Wolfe said. “But he did hit a lot of the more important topics harder on the head as he felt necessary and it was nice to hear it in his voice for the first time. That was awesome. I have respect for humanity and life in general and the way he approaches and sees it is really fascinating. Really, it’s respectable.”</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Herman Li said he attended Greitens’ lecture because of his prior training experience with the United States Marine Corps. According to Li, the lecture was more successful and influenced him more than previous, similar events he has attended.</p>\n<p>“I just thought his advice on getting through pain and suffering was really good … to build resilience,” Li said. “I wasn’t expecting this many people because I went to an event a few weeks ago where a marine was speaking and there was only like ten people.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major Patrick Mossman said he attended the lecture to learn more about the military.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested in joining Army ROTC [Reserve Officers’ Training Corps] here and I just decided to come because I thought it would be interesting hearing from someone, especially a Navy SEAL,” Mossman said. “He had a lot of interesting things to say. I definitely learned some things.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin said hearing Greitens speak was as an impactful learning experience.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience,” Franklin said. “But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. I liked his ideas of growing from what we have experienced. He said something like, ‘What happens to us becomes a part of us’ and that really resonated with me.”</p>\n<p>According to Franklin, Greiten’s idea of “segmenting,” or breaking work assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks, was helpful.</p>\n<p>“That’s helpful in everyday life,” Franklin said. “As students, and a lot of us with jobs, we have busy lives that can seem overwhelming. So I’ll be using this segmenting advice in my life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/","id":2841,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2840,2839,2838],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lecture Talks About Reintroducing Extinct Animals","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Conservation-Talk_Brendan-Mansfield-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Conservation-Talk_Brendan-Mansfield-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) hosted a talk on the possibilities of resurrecting extinct life by Oliver A.

Ryder, Director of the San Diego Zoo’s Frozen Zoo Project and Chair of the Zoo’s Institute for Conservation Research, delivers a talk on reviving extinct species.<em> Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) hosted a talk on the possibilities of resurrecting extinct life by Oliver A. Ryder titled “Conservation, De-Extinction, and the Future of Life” in the HSSB McCune Conference Room on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Ryder is the Director of the Frozen Zoo Project at the San Diego Zoo’s Institute for Conservation Research, a project that freezes cell samples and DNA from over half a million endangered organisms in an effort to save species coming close to extinction.</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, there is increased global concern for conservation and he is disappointed in the United States’ lack of participation in international conservation treaties.</p>\n<p>“The international community is making goals to provide standards and higher expectations to express these problems on a global basis,” Ryder said. “Our country is one of the great minority in the world that has not participated in the discussion since we did sign the Convention [on] Biological Diversity. We have a major role to play in the involvement of these discussions one way or another.”</p>\n<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity is a multilateral international treaty signed in 1992 by over 150 countries across the world pledging a commitment to ensure conservation of biological diversity within their borders. As of 2014, the U.S. has signed but not ratified the conditions of the 1992 agreement.</p>\n<p>Ryder said the now extinct Hawaiian po’o-uli bird was been studied in the Frozen Zoo Project using cells of the bird from previously acquired genetic samples.</p>\n<p>“[The Po’ouli bird] is a real just a tragic story and a prime example of dysfunction,” Ryder said. “However we were able to receive some DNA of the species before the bird died and we were able to grow some living cells out of it. It was a surreal experience. How the cells are growing vivaciously and seeing the chromosomes being created and just knowing the organism is gone.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, in 1987 conservationists counted the amount of California Condors and found a shockingly low total population of about 20 birds. Participants took samples of and tagged each individual bird and found they were struggling to survive due to lead pollution, according to Ryder who participated in the project.</p>\n<p>“We used DNA fingerprinting on 23 condors and found each Condor to only three clans and found they have a genetic disease, like a lethal dwarfism that prevented chicks from hatching, resulting from lead in the environment,” Ryder said. “As a result of that, Governor Brown signed a bill banning lead bullets, but California is the only state to do this even though the condor is present in Arizona and Utah.”</p>\n<p>Ryder said one of the biggest success stories is of the black-footed ferret, which was thought to have been extinct but reappeared in Wyoming in 1981. Seven of the ferrets brought to captivity reproduced successfully using artificial semen, a process that increases genetic diversity.</p>\n<p>“Currently, all 8,000 ferrets in captivity came from seven individuals,” Ryder said. “We received skin biopsies samples from ferrets who were alive earlier to create artificial semen. The semen was then used on the seven individuals who gave birth to ferrets that now have more genetic diversity, which will help the overall survival of the black footed ferret species.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, the only way to help increase genetic diversity of endangered animals is by cloning, which he considers an expensive procedure.</p>\n<p>“Cloning is the only way to do it,” Ryder said. “However this is used as a model for cystic fibrosis research. There are ferrets who are given the gene for the human form of cystic fibrosis that are then used as test subjects for medication treatment. They can take the ferret cell but it costs about $50,000 to $150,000.”</p>\n<p>Ryder said the San Diego Zoo is attempting to use Frozen Zoo Project samples to save the only five remaining northern white rhinoceros, but that saving the animals will not be enough to save the species if the rhinos do not breed.</p>\n<p>“We took some cells from one of the rhinos and grew stem cells from them, which can make any cells in the body,” Ryder said. “Theoretically we can save the white rhinos, however the rhinos aren’t repopulating. There are five walking around, but if there is no offspring, they might as well be extinct already.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, future generations are raised with notions of potentially saving endangered species, and must decide the future of manipulating genomes.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to watch movies like ‘Ice Age’ because it assaults everything we know about DNA and genes, but this is the world our children are growing up in,” Ryder said. “They’re growing up believing this is possible, and it might be, but it’s up to them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Bree Brydenthal said she believes scientists need to work purposefully when conducting research and should consider whether their work will benefit the community.</p>\n<p>“I think the question that has to be asked is what is the point of them branching out to bring these animals into a world we don’t need them in,” Brydenthal said. “Is it beneficial to our current ecosystem or will it have serious environmental consequences? I think we have to determine what place it will have.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Brianna Acuesta said freezing samples could lead to moral debates among researchers and the general public.</p>\n<p>“In terms of morality, it’s the issues that come up of this topic,” Acuesta said. “People are talking about cloning or bringing back animals that necessarily don’t have a place in our world right now. But also we’re not talking about mammoths, we’re talking about species such as the passenger pigeon too.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62032\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62032\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/","id":2838,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2837,2836,2835],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Adopt-A-Block Holds Isla Vista Clean-up Following Deltopia","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Volunteer organization Adopt-A-Block held an Isla Vista clean-up following a full day of Deltopia festivities on Saturday, drawing over 300 students participants on Sunday.

Many participants were students from various environmental groups, community service organizations and Greek life.</p>\n<p>Adopt-A-Block supervisor Adam Porté said I.V. relies solely on volunteers for clean-up and that without volunteer help, litter would otherwise be left on the streets.</p>\n<p>“Most of the time everywhere else in the world … you’re going to have a private contractor that would come out and clean up all the trash afterwards,” Porté said. “We don’t have that here, so the amount of trash that is generated and is left on the streets from events like this is just essential to have all these volunteers because if we didn’t that stuff would just sit there forever.”</p>\n<p>According to Porté, clean-up events are important because I.V. does not have street sweeping days, and street sweepers are unable to remove trash because of the large number of parked cars.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista we technically don’t have street sweeping days,” Porté said. “All the cars on one side of the street never have to be moved, so a street sweeper can’t get in. So any of the trash you see on the ground never gets picked up except when our volunteers pick it up.”</p>\n<p>Computer engineering major and Lieutenant Governor of Circle K International Club Andrew Pagan said he helped organize and keep track of the logistics of the cleanup.</p>\n<p>“Today we are helping out with registration because we need people to sign waivers and come back to register the number of hours they picked up trash, number of buckets of trash, and blocks they covered,” said Pagan. “Having 300 people in one day in two hours cleans a lot of blocks”</p>\n<p>First-year economics and accounting major Dejanae Allen said collecting trash is important for the safety of Isla Vistans, especially with the large amount of glass littering the streets.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of glass, so we were trying to pick that up because I know some people walk around barefoot so we got to make sure we get that picked up,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>Second-year environmental studies and economics double major Jose Valdez said athough Deltopia this year did not generate as much trash as last year, it is important to clean up litter accumulated to protect the environment.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia was a lot more controlled this year with the huge effort to keep out-of-towners out of here, so people were more controlled so it’s a lot less trash, people were more respectful especially since most of them lived here,” Valdez said. “It’s important to clean the trash up because that trash you see on the sidewalk will end up in the sewers, and that sewer will end up in the water and that’s going to effect the environment.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies major Anbareen Shefa said trash on streets in I.V. could easily end up in the ocean.</p>\n<p>“We’re so close to the ocean when you have heavy winds, the winds just going to blow all the trash into the ocean, so I’m trying to divert that as much as I can,” Shefa said. “There are lots of cigarette butts, which is mostly what I’m after. People smash them into the plants and stuff, it’s sad.”</p>\n<p>Porté said he was content with the number of people that showed up to participate in the cleanup and was glad to take part in the event to improve the I.V. environment.</p>\n<p>“It’s so much fun to come in and see all these people come together to want to clean up their community,” Porté said. “It’s just so rewarding. And I know that I’m helping out the community and know I’m improving the quality of life for 23,000 people. I’m huge on environmentalism, because that ocean out there it can’t protect itself, so we got to do something about it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62021\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62021\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/","id":4744,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[4743,4742,4741],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Deltopia Calmer Than Last Year’s","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This past weekend’s Deltopia street party did not repeat last year’s violent riots and drew only half the crowd, with approximately 10,000 people on the streets of Isla Vista by midday and only ro...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62043\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1661429318\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62040\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62043\" data-attachment-id=\"62043\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/deltopia-participants-walking-on-dp/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428154403\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Deltopia_Alex Gonzalez\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62043\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.

The Sheriff’s Office partially attributed smaller crowds to the efforts of I.V. residents to defer out-of-towners from coming into their homes and parties. Other factors contributing to the decrease in attendees, according to the Sheriff’s Office, include the university’s efforts, student-only activities, over 100 police officers from across UC campuses and assistance from law enforcement agencies from the surrounding counties. According to the Sheriff’s Office, the county festival ordinance prohibiting music after 6 p.m. and restricting parking on certain streets in I.V. and Goleta was “instrumental” in reducing the crowd size.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated. – Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the 50 percent decrease in attendance from last year, the Sheriff’s Office stated the number of arrests and citations remained high because of increased presence of law enforcement. Preliminary numbers provided by the Sheriff’s Office count 140 citations and 102 arrests issued, compared to 190 citations and 130 arrests during last year’s Deltopia. Medical incidents this year also decreased significantly with only nine medical transports reported compared to 50 in 2014.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason said in an email the crowds this past weekend were more manageable compared to last year.</p>\n<p>“The crowds were smaller and more respectful than last year,” Eliason said in an email. “On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated.”</p>\n<p>According to Eliason, the calmer crowds were in part due to the planning and coordination that began months prior to the event.</p>\n<p>“I think the tremendous planning and coordinated effort by everyone affiliated with the event helped to make it more enjoyable than last year,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the number of arrests and citations were a reflection of the saturation of police within I.V. and not necessarily of a reckless student body.</p>\n<p>“Keep in mind that there were over 300 police officers in a one square mile radius,” Schunk said. “If you have a bunch of people in an area drinking, there are going to be people who are committing crimes. If you have hundreds more police officers, then the rate at which those people who are committing even minor nonviolent offensives, there is a higher chance that there will be a police officer nearby.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property. – Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said he agreed the coordinated efforts demonstrated a sense of ownership by I.V. locals for the event.</p>\n<p>“I noticed a lot of cooperation amongst different entities in order to really take ownership of the event and provide structure,” Schunk said. “UCIV, the campus, IVFP, UCPD, and Life of the Party … There was a sense that this was more than just some wild street party that got out of control automatically.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, if this trend of community involvement continues he believes extra policing will not be necessary at future Deltopia weekends.</p>\n<p>“I think even police officers resonated with that and it helped them show a little more restraint,” Schunk said. “I think over time we could see the level of necessary policing decrease more and more as we add in that structure that helps support the event.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said to continue positive progress for a safer Deltopia, he hopes to see more focus on the student volunteer program University of California Isla Vista (UCIV), which helped facilitate Deltopia and the lawful conduction of festivities this past weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think really the thing I would love to see targeted and expanded upon next year is the UCIV program. And the idea of student volunteers,” Schunk said. “The reception generally was incredibly favorable. Countless people came up to us and said, ‘Thank you so much for taking your time today to hand out water bottles.’ People were almost incredulous.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr said he understands the need for police action during Deltopia and hopes the event will gradually return to a smaller party meant for I.V. locals.</p>\n<p>“I think the intimidation from the sheer number of police this Deltopia was one of the only benefits of mass law enforcement,” Foehr said. “My 300 person party getting shut down at 3:00 p.m. at the time it seemed unnecessary, but it was for the general welfare and I understand that. I feel that next year’s Deltopia will be more local and back to normal like before the [2014] riots because of this intimidating police presence.”</p>\n<p>Foehr also said he believed the increased police presence had some disadvantages.</p>\n<p>“However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property,” Foehr said. “Also, it’s a waste of public resources to have so many cops here, just because of irresponsible college kids.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Nehanda Wells attended Deltopia this past weekend and said she also experienced a run-in with the police, but the incident did not change her opinion on the positive aspects of additional policing.</p>\n<p>“Outside BevMo! … a cop banged on my window and asked to see my ID. I’ve never had that happen before. It was intimidating because I wasn’t doing anything wrong,” Wells said. “I’m not saying that it was a bad thing. I just think that was reaching too far. But as far as having more police here for the weekend, it obviously worked because things were much calmer this year than last year.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62040\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62040\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/","id":4748,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[4747,4746,4745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Shooting Victim Files Complaint Against County, Sheriff, Regents","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Former student Antoine Cherchian, a victim of the May 23 Isla Vista shooting last spring who survived multiple gunshot wounds, filed a complaint for damages against the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Former student Antoine Cherchian, a victim of the May 23 Isla Vista shooting last spring who survived multiple gunshot wounds, filed a complaint for damages against the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, the County of Santa Barbara and the University of California Board of Regents on March 10, alleging a violation of due process under the 14th Amendment.</p>\n<p>The case brief lists events preceding perpetrator and former Santa Barbara City College student Elliot Rodger’s shooting spree, exemplifying him as a public danger. The plaintiff alleges that the Sheriff’s Department violated their own Law Enforcement Services Manual by not investigating the department’s former incidents of contact with Rodger and not performing a background check on California’s gun registration system after receiving complaints about Rodger’s violent tendencies. Cherchian’s brief also alleges the county, Sheriff’s Department and the UC Regents violated policy manuals, the Psychiatric Emergency Team Regulations and the Firearm Policy  by not requesting or providing a mental health evaluation by a licensed clinician after receiving a welfare check request from Rodgers’s mother, Chin Rodgers, on April 30, 2014.</p>\n<p>Because of these violations, Cherchian alleges the defendants deprived him of his right to be free from personal injury and threat of death, claiming each of the accused are legally responsible for the injuries and damages he sustained on May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p>The case brief states the Sheriff’s Department and the Regents acted irresponsibly by not acting on the readily available information Rodger himself posted on public websites, which included multiple videos posted to YouTube under his name expressing violent threats. According to the case brief, the Sheriff’s Department also failed to perform a check on the California gun registry or interview any of Rodger’s mental health providers, despite their ability to consult the registry where information on his possession of firearms would have been available.</p>\n<p>“Recklessly and with deliberate indifference … no person from the SBCSD [Sheriff’s Department] or the Regents watched any part of any videos, reviewed any of Rodger’s other online postings, performed any kind of gun ownership or background check, or interviewed any mental health provider where Rodger was a known psychiatric patient,” the case brief states.</p>\n<p>Cherchian’s brief also alleges the Sheriff’s Department is essentially responsible for putting those around Rodger in danger because of their lack of investigation into his background and unstable nature.</p>\n<p>“Through their conduct, the officers impliedly affirmed that Rodger was not dangerous to the public, increasing the existing danger to his roommates, their guests, and the general public, living and interacting with Rodger on a daily basis in the college community about him,” the case brief states.</p>\n<p>According to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office final investigative summary report on the I.V. mass murder released on Feb. 19, while six law enforcement officers responded to the welfare check request made by Chin Rodger, the sheriff’s deputies found no risk factors that justified a search of Rodger’s apartment or an involuntary mental health hold.</p>\n<p>“[Rodger] explained he was having trouble fitting in socially in Isla Vista,” the report states. “The videos were merely a way of expressing himself. There was nothing during the contact with the suspect that gave deputies reason to believe he was a danger to himself or others.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry and math major Jose Brizuela said he believes the Sheriff’s Department should not be the target of Cherchian’s lawsuit because he feels law enforcement did their jobs to the best of their ability.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like the sheriffs should be the people they go for because they were just doing their job to begin with,” Brizuela said. “Even when everything happened, they tried their hardest to stop [Rodger].”</p>\n<p>Brizuela also said this lawsuit may set a precedent for more victims to come forward against the Sheriff’s Department, the Regents and the County.</p>\n<p>“If this guy’s medical bills get paid off and whatever he wants to gets paid off, I’m sure other people will try and do the same,” Brizuela said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year mechanical engineering major Caroline Park said Rodger’s parents are more to blame than the Sheriff’s Department because she believes they were aware Rodger had purchased weapons and was a potential danger.</p>\n<p>“When I first read about the case, I definitely thought that his parents were more in the wrong than anyone else,” Park said. “They had the most information. They knew he had guns. They knew that he was dangerous.”</p>\n<p>According to the report on the shooting, Rodger’s parents had been informed by his life coach about the manifesto and YouTube videos, but had no knowledge of his weapons and did not view him as a threat to others.</p>\n<p>“Sheriff’s detectives … spoke with both of the suspect’s parents, Peter and Chin Rodger, by telephone. The parents were in the process of driving to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles,” the report states. “Both were worried about their son based on the manifesto that had been emailed earlier that evening, but they both found it very difficult to believe that their son either owned weapons or would actually hurt anyone.”</p>\n<p>Park also said the Sheriff’s Department has a duty to protect the rights of citizens living in I.V. and were in a difficult position during the welfare check on April 30, 2014. Park said she believes that if law enforcement had searched Rodger’s apartment and found nothing, it would be assumed they were violating his rights and would set a bad precedent.</p>\n<p>“I think either way it could have gone wrong. If they were able to search his house and find something, that would have been great,” Park said. “But if it didn’t happen that way, that would be violating his rights. That could happen to any one of us in I.V. and I think that sets a bad example.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Director of news and media relations at the Office of Public Affairs, George Foulsham, declined to comment on the case, stating the university does not comment on pending litigation.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the Santa Barbara County Counsel and Cherchian’s legal team did not respond to requests for comment.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62001\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62001\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/","id":4758,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[4757,4756,4755],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The committee will revisit the resolution at its next meeting next Thursday.</p>\n<p>The controversial resolution calls on the university, ASUCSB, the UCSB Foundation and UC Regents to divest from companies selling equipment to the Israeli government for use in “Israel’s military occupation and siege of the Palestinian territories.” The resolution specifically names Hewlett-Packard, Raytheon, Motorola, Caterpillar and General Electric as companies that should have profited due to their sale of various pieces of equipment to the Israeli government including biometric scanners, engines for Apache helicopters and various guided missiles.</p>\n<p>The resolution cites the UC’s historic disinvestment from South Africa over its apartheid policies as precedent for continued divestment from companies doing business with Israel.</p>\n<p>“ASUCSB will examine its assets and UC assets for investments in companies that a) provide military support for, or weaponry to support, the occupation of the Palestinian Territories, or b) facilitate the building or maintenance of the Separation Wall or the demolition of Palestinian homes, or c) facilitate in the building, maintenance, or economic development of Israeli settlements on annexed Palestinian territories,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major, Students for Justice in Palestine member and co-author of the divestment resolution Anumita Kaur read the language of the resolution calling for the university to take action.</p>\n<p>“Let it finally be resolved that we the students call upon our university to disassociate itself from companies that promote systematic discrimination, inequality and human rights violations,” Kaur said. “Where this system targets people based on religion, gender, race orientation by divesting in companies that participate in or profit from human rights violations.”</p>\n<p>Kaur also said it is distressing for students to know that their funds are being invested in companies engaged in military activities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>“Knowing that our money is going to companies that provide missiles, going to companies that bulldoze homes, going to companies that provide surveillance systems and biometric systems that are used to restrict freedom of movement — wrong,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Second-year biopsychology major Niki Elyasi said the divestment resolution would do nothing to address the flaws in Israeli state policy.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that being pro-Israel means that you love Israel for all its flaws, because Israel does have flaws, but I don’t think that means that a resolution like this will solve those flaws at all,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<p>Kaur summarized her perspective of the goal of the divestment movement toward the end of her presentation and said, “We are just trying to wash the blood off our hands.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh spoke in favor of some of the more controversial aspects of Israeli policy addressed in the resolution, such as the military blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been in effect since 2007.</p>\n<p>“The reason there is an imposed blockade is because terrorists smuggle weapons into Gaza before that have been used directly to attack Israeli citizens, Moreh said. “If Israel does not restrain to a certain level what goes into Gaza, its citizens are in critical danger.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and economics double major Guy Singer said he is opposed to the passage of the divestment resolution because it does not include any input from the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“I want the Jewish community to be involved in some way, and they have not been. In fact, having to take this on this week has been a complete surprise to all of us,” Singer said. “What I’m here to suggest is we vote this bill down, we form an ad hoc committee of certain representatives from certain communities to put forward a bill that addresses the various needs of the communities.”</p>\n<p>Second-year physics major Senator Liam Stanton said he was in favor of tabling the bill for next week and anticipated it will be voted on eventually by the full Senate.</p>\n<p>“Either tabling it here or tabling it in big Senate, sending it there and then tabling it, is the appropriate thing to do, regardless of which side of the resolution you go on,” Stanton said. “I think of course it will get to big Senate.”</p>\n<p>After further debate and discussion a proposal was made to table the motion for one week, with five of the six senators voting in favor and one opposed vote from Moreh, the motion passed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The task force also released a list of demands on Wednesday, calling for “the demilitarization of police at major events such as Halloween and Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Anonymous members of the Task Force said in an email the protest and list of demands were aimed at resisting the increase of over-policing, militant practices and profit-based ticketing in I.V. and on campus.</p>\n<p>“We came across the page ‘Keep Isla Vista Safe.’ This page proclaims to operate as a community effort to maintain order and safety throughout the streets of Isla Vista,”<br>\nthe members said in an email. “Instead, this campaign boastingly intimidates students with memes regarding the increase of profitable restrictions and police presence.”</p>\n<p>According to Task Force members, student demonstrations and demands have been presented to university administration in order to bring attention to the relationship between increased police presence and tension between students, I.V. residents and authority figures.</p>\n<p>“When students see so many police officers swarming the streets of Isla Vista, walking around with their hands on their guns, it creates a hostile environment that makes students feel unsafe and defensive, as though they have already been profiled as criminals,” members said in an email. “This atmosphere is what produces unfortunate events like the riot that occurred during Deltopia last year.”</p>\n<p>The Task Force’s demands call for “redirection of funds from tickets into restorative programs and educational safety courses” and insist “all law enforcement officers participate in a required cultural competency and diversity training,” aimed to educate officers “on the emotional, social and psychological effects of police presence experienced by students of color and other marginalized groups.”</p>\n<p>Demonstrators in the Arbor wore black and placed duct tape over their mouths, asking passing students to sign a “stop over-policing” petition directed toward Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Members also called for students to participate in a photo project called “300+,” in which students wrote one descriptive word about their reaction to the planned presence of over 300 police officers in I.V. for Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“Students have expressed that Isla Vista policing makes them feel threatened, triggered, targeted, criminalized, nervous, unsafe, uncomfortable, and exploited,” the members said in an email. “We believe that the photos and expressions from the community highlight the general consensus from students and I.V. residents that large numbers of police do not make them feel protected or safe, but rather the opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year global studies major Ogui González Vilá, the increase of ordinances and restrictions during Deltopia weekend alienate students from police.</p>\n<p>“I wish that there was just more collaboration between students and police in events like these,” Vilá said. “I know there are other alternatives to discourage people from attending Deltopia other than using police scare tactics.”</p>\n<p>The Task Force on Police Brutality finally stated that their demands be “implemented within the next 3-6 months,” with Yang’s official response expected “no later than 5 p.m. on April 8th 2015.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 the Thursday, April 2, 2015 print edition.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/","id":2837,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2836,2835,2834],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Seven UC campus Senates except for UCSB, UC Merced and UC San Francisco student senates have passed resolutions calling for financial divestment from such businesses and a similar resolution failed to pass at the university last year. The resolution sparked debate between students Wednesday about Israeli-Palestine relations as dozens of students gave their opinions on the resolution and experiences with anti-Semitism. A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk updated the Senate on developments with Isla Vista self-governance progress and A.S. Program Board commissioner Ben Simons urged students to attend university-sponsored events during Deltopia this weekend.</p>\n<p>Member of the UCSB chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) Anumita Kaur sponsored a bill that would voice the Senate’s support to stop UC investments and contracts with businesses allegedly profiting from human rights abuses in conflict areas in Israel and Palestine and said students’ tuition is funding to these corporations.</p>\n<p>“When you pay your tuition, you are investing in corporations and currently those corporations are profiting off of apartheid and profiting off of occupation,” Kaur said. “All this bill means is that we do not agree with that.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major and SJP member Shahryar Mooraj spoke to the Senate about injustices committed against the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p>“The fact is that Palestinians living in Gaza, in lands disputed with Israel, live in an apartheid state,” Mooraj said. “On a daily basis they are subjected to Israeli policies such as segregated bus lines, the continuation of illegal settlement building, home demolitions [and] housing discrimination.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61960\" style=\"width: 346px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61960\" data-attachment-id=\"61960\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/a-s-senate-meeting-discusses-uc-divestment-anti-semitism/senate_lorenzo-basilio-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=600%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,454\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1427875777\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_Lorenzo Basilio-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=600%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61960\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=336%2C254\" alt=\"Senators listen as students voice their opinions during public forum.

External Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>Senator Michelle Moreh then introduced a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and said she introduced the resolution “to raise awareness about the outgrowth of hatred of Jews around the world.”</p>\n<p>“We still have swastikas being spray-painted on Jewish fraternities at other UC schools, we still have students denying the right to exist of the only Jewish state in the world and we still have a candidate for UCLA’s judicial board being discriminated against on the basis of her Jewish identity,” Moreh said. “We still have flyers posted around UCSB blaming the Jews for 9/11.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Muslim Students Association (MSA) President and fourth-year biochemistry major Yasmin Sallak said she supports the bill and noted there is a distinction between anti-Semitism and criticism of the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>“I want to do my part to make sure that Jewish students feel safe expressing their identity,” Sallak said. “When speaking about Israel I’d like to point out, just as the resolution does, that there is a significant difference between criticizing the being of Israel and critiquing Israeli policy.”</p>\n<p>The resolution to condemn anti-Semitism passed with a vote of 23-0 with one abstention from second-year economics and accounting major and Senator Steven Kwok.</p>\n<p>Simons outlined all of the on-campus events Program Board has scheduled to minimize the amount of students in Isla Vista during Deltopia weekend and said students should attend the events to encourage administrators to support similar alternative programming in the future.</p>\n<p>“This needs to be a success in order for us to continue doing stuff like this,” Simons said. “There is no way the university will allow us to create events like this if this one is not successful.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the University of California Isla Vista (UCIV) volunteer program will help facilitate Deltopia and the lawful conduction of festivities this weekend.</p>\n<p>“These students are acting as an independent body,” Schunk said. “This year, UCSB is taking ownership over I.V. and what happens in it.”</p>\n<p>The program currently consists of around 50 students and three Greek organizations. UCIV is still accepting volunteers, who will receive free shirts and food if they participate, and will be holding an orientation Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>“UCIV is a volunteer program,” Schunk said. “Every volunteer will have a backpack with water bottles, maps with all the locations and know where the water stations and resources are.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the problems surrounding Deltopia partially stem from distrust between law enforcement and students.</p>\n<p>“The status quo is there is a lack of trust in student responsibility,” Schunk said. “We are hoping for a better bank of student-police interactions.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said more planning and precautions were taken this year as a result of Deltopia last spring, and next week plans will be made for the 2016 Deltopia based off the weekend event.</p>\n<p>“There was a lack of momentum last year,” Schunk said. “Everyone stepped back and said, ‘Wow that’s terrible that happened, we should never let that happen again’ but the conversation ended there. In addition, the week following will be a week of action and discussion. So what this week will focus on is discussion forums for solutions about problems we face this year and what to fix … or what went right and what we should expand upon.”</p>\n<p>Schunk then moved on to discuss the progress of I.V. self-governance bill AB 3 and said the preliminary report for financing the bill is set to be completed by the end of May and the full report to be finished by July.</p>\n<p>“We are getting financial feasibility,” Schunk said. “It will answer the question, ‘Do we have the money to move forward with self-governance?’ … It’s really good to see the community working together to provide benefit and support.”</p>\n<p>Senate ended with brief updates on the upcoming installation of vending machines on campus and the progression of redesigning student ACCESS cards.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 the Thursday, April 2, 2015 print edition.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article incorrectly reported the location of today’s AS External Affairs Committee meeting as the Goleta Valley room of the UCen.

UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa led the discussion, and four other officers attended to answer students’ questions in smaller groups. Deputies from Isla Vista Foot Patrol were initially expected to attend, but did not make an appearance. Questions about the I.V. noise ordinance, parking restrictions and roadblocks and the high number of cops brought in for Deltopia dominated the event.</p>\n<p>Signa opened the event by detailing the parking restrictions on Del Playa and Sabado Tarde, and encouraged students to buy on-campus parking permits and said the event’s purpose was to foster open dialogue.</p>\n<p>“The whole point of tonight is really just an opportunity for me to talk to you about Deltopia and what we are doing there,” Signa said. “It’s also — more importantly — for me to be available to you to answer any questioning.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and UCPD officer Alexis Dougherty said Pizza with Police is good way to educate students on Deltopia and other law enforcement matters.</p>\n<p>“If they have any questions about what’s going to go on this weekend, they can feel free to come up to us and ask openly,” Dougherty said.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Oliveira, a first-year global studies major, said she came to the event to better understand what Deltopia will be like.</p>\n<p>“This is my first year here, so I don’t really know what to expect at Deltopia,” Oliveira said. “I’m hoping this will give me more information on what is going to happen and on how I can make it safe.”</p>\n<p>Shiva Mozaffarian, a fourth-year biology major who had an involved discussion with Signa during the event, said she wrote a list of questions beforehand to ensure she could express her concerns.</p>\n<p>“I wrote them up because I wanted to make sure that I could rationally say all my frustrations about the police department,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian said she attended the event primarily to understand the perspective of police officers on Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that these cops are the police officers that I have problems with, so I just wanted to see if they shared that same issues that we have as the community,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>According to Mozaffarian, some students resist the cops only because they want to party freely, but others, like those who attend events like Pizza with Police, want to offer useful criticism.</p>\n<p>“Some people have problems with the cops because they stop them from partying and drinking, but I think a lot of people are genuinely looking out for the well-being of our community,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>Many attendees had questions about the special noise ordinance in I.V. for Deltopia weekend. The ordinance states I.V. residents playing music that can be heard from the street can be cited and given a $500 fine. Signa said the ordinance is meant to limit the size of gathering in I.V. residences.</p>\n<p>“As long as the music can’t be heard from outside, it’s no issue, and we’re not looking for that,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Jake Gorham, a third-year political science major, and Duncan Calvert, a third-year political science and history double major, organized the event in their roles as public safety coordinators for the Office of the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA). They started a volunteer force called UCIV Safety Coalition that will consist of 30 volunteers patrolling I.V. during Deltopia handing our water and warning students who may be at risk of citation or arrest.</p>\n<p>Gorham said he hopes that, if the UCIV program is successful, he and Calvert can turn it into a more permanent establishment to contribute to community policing in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are really trying to advocate for community policing in Isla Vista, and we are hoping the volunteer program brings that out,” Gorham said. “It’s not going to happen overnight, but we are hoping for gradual change.”</p>\n<p>According to Calvert, the volunteer force will mainly focus on preventing noise-related citations and said they will help relay information about parking restrictions, but obeying the law is ultimately the individual student’s responsibility.</p>\n<p>“The volunteer force is hopefully going to mitigate all of the noise ordinance violations,” Calvert said. “We really don’t want students having misdemeanors on their records and having that bad experience.”</p>\n<p>Calvert said he hopes that the volunteer force will show UCPD and the IVFP that there are students actively seeking solutions for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The majority of police officers are dealing with our population at its worst,” Calvert said. “We are trying to create a good dialogue between the student body and officers who care and are committed.”</p>\n<p>Signa also said he supports Gorham and Clavert’s endeavor.</p>\n<p>“It’s better that students talk to students than that the cops talk to them,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa said he hopes arrests will be minimal, but warned that there will be no drunk tank in I.V. and all students will be processed and sent to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>“If arrests do happen, we will be very strict as far as if you are drinking and publicly intoxicated,” Signa said. “With all the cops out there, there will be zero tolerance.”</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian however said she thinks the cops focus too much on arresting students for public drunkenness.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern is that — after everything we’ve undergone — I think it’s been proven that the problems of I.V. are not due to the parties or the drunk students walking around minding their own business,” Mozaffarian said. “The problem is bigger than that.”</p>\n<p>Gorham said he hopes UCIV will help warn students that they are at risk for arrest for public drunkenness before they come in contact with the police.</p>\n<p>“The police have said it’s technically a no-tolerance policy during Detlopia,” Gorham said. “Our goal is to be able to give out warnings and give people a heads up.”</p>\n<p>A central concern among students at the event was the increase of police presence planned for Deltopia, but Signa said this increase is proven to correlate with lower crime rates.</p>\n<p>“The whole idea is we want to saturate the place and just be visible,” Signa said. “They are looking for people who might be causing problems that might be dangerous.”</p>\n<p>Despite this, Signa said he believes the solution to I.V.’s fundamental problems do not lie in increased police presence.</p>\n<p>“As much as the police department and the sheriff’s department put in effort as far as having cops here, bringing in a horse team, and all this extra equipment, that’s only a band aid that doesn’t fix the problem,” Signa said. “The problem has to be fixed from within the community.”</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian said she understands the crime-prevention intention of increased police presence but said she is not convinced of its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really understand why we bring extra law enforcement, but still go after drunk students just sitting on a curb,” Mozaffarian said. “If the cops are here to protect and serve, they shouldn’t be victimizing the students.”</p>\n<p>After the event, Mozaffarian said Signa was clearly being “diplomatic” when he answered her questions and she said she appreciated his effort to work with students.</p>\n<p>“Mark is such an amazing guy,” Mozaffarian said. “He is one of the cops that prove that there are good cops out there with good intentions who are looking out for the best of our community.”</p>\n<p>Signa said he hopes the dialogue between students and police can extend beyond Pizza with Police and special circumstances like Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“We need to represent you,” Signa said. “You need to be able to come to us and ask your questions — not just at Pizza with the Cops.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Brown said the convention would be accommodating transfer students to increase their range of knowledge in leadership training.</p>\n<p>“As you know a lot of transfers are very diverse, the students I take [to the conference] want to be leading these spaces next year,” Brown said. “We want to make sure they have a lot of information regarding diversity training, leadership training as well because

schools to the punch and have it here. 250 students, 70 or 80 on the waitlist right now,” Smith said. “We’ve been selected for one out of 25 actuarial schools in the nation and first in the West Coast.”</p>\n<p>Requesting funding for a student-professor luncheon, Society of Undergraduate Biologists Co-Chair Jessie Wong said the club allows biology students, who comprise 25 percent of undergraduates, to have access to professors and instructors in their field.</p>\n<p>“In the biology major there can be a thousand plus students in intro level courses, in the Society of Undergraduate Biologists we try to bridge this community between professors and students so that students are not afraid to get to know the professors,” Wong said. “Once you’re a senior, you go up to a professor for a recommendation but it may be like, ‘I got an A but I’m just a face and you don’t know me.’”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

According to her close friends, Stone was interested in becoming a novelist after college and was passionate about music.</p>\n<p>During her time at the <i>Daily Nexus</i>, Stone showed a penchant for covering concerts and wrote notably about events such as the September 2013’s Welcome Back concert featuring Borgore and last March’s Childish Gambino concert at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Stone, originally from Nepal, spent ten years in Vietnam and moved to different residences with her family several times. She spoke Japanese, French, Spanish, Nepalese and English. Her parents reside in Hanoi, Vietnam.</p>\n<p>CCS Dean and paleobiology professor Bruce Tiffney announced Stone’s passing in an email to CCS students, staff and faculty early Monday.</p>\n<p>“We are all saddened by the death of a student dear to us and full of promise,” Tiffney said in the email. “Lalita brought her best to CCS and UCSB and will be sorely missed.”</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"61765\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-10/ccs-lit-major-nexite-passes-away/lita-square/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?fit=422%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"422,422\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"lita square\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?fit=422%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-61765\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=350%2C350\" alt=\"lita square\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?w=422&amp;ssl=1 422w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Former <i>Daily Nexus </i>Artsweek editor and CCS art alumna Demi Anter, who worked with Stone last year, said Stone’s articles were well-written and “always had a really strong voice in them.”</p>\n<p>“She was very funny and really sort of forward about things,” Anter said. “Lita was never afraid to say that she didn’t like something. She was very strong and would stand up for her opinions about things and so that was something I hugely appreciated from writers.”</p>\n<p>Stone’s friend and fourth-year economics and accounting major Vivian Hu, who met Stone as a freshman Chi Delta Theta pledge, described Stone as frequently being “very positive” and as someone who was friends with students across the entire Greek community.</p>\n<p>“She loved everyone so fiercely. She would go above and beyond for anyone. She would do you any favor, do anything to make you feel better,” Hu said. “She’s probably the only person I can say never had a bad thing to say about anyone else.”</p>\n<p>According to Hu, Stone was selfless in her friendships with others.</p>\n<p>“She would make sure everyone else is okay before she would think of herself,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>Lalita’s former roommate and global studies alumna Elaine Yoo said Stone had a passion for music and had a rich, eclectic musical taste.</p>\n<p>“Every morning when we would wake up we’d listen to a lot of The Strokes,” Yoo said. “She also liked playing the accordion and listening to classical music … [junior year] she was really into Calvin Harris and that’s kind of how it started where she wanted to attend more EDM shows and write about it.”</p>\n<p>Yoo said Stone was planning out her first novel before she passed away.</p>\n<p>“She was actually in the process of trying to write a novel … she had a list that she was making like a plan for herself,” Yoo said. “That was something she was aspiring to do.”</p>\n<p>Stone’s parents will hold a memorial service for her Tuesday, March 10, beginning at 4 p.m. in Loma Pelona Center, Room 1108, near San Rafael Residence Hall and Manzanita Village.

Positions to be filled include President, Internal Vice President (IVP), External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA), External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), Student Advocate General (SAG) and off-campus and on-campus senators.</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major running for A.S. President with OPP Jimmy Villareal said one major project he was involved with last year was a general poll that allowed students to give input to A.S.</p>\n<p>“An effort that I was kind of a part of was the Associated Students strategic plan, and that was basically something I did last year,” Villareal said. “We took surveys from over 1,800 students, kind of asked them what they wanted to see from us, what does A.S. do well, what does A.S. not do well, how can we improve and what do they want to see from us in the future.”</p>\n<p>According to Villareal, his main goal is to anticipate and cater to the wants and needs of the student body.</p>\n<p>“That’s really what I want to focus on, is what kind of services we’re providing for the students, how can we take the services that we had already and make them better,” Villareal said. “How can we be more efficient with those, and how can we identify things that students really want, that we aren’t providing already, and find a way to do that and make it feasible.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running for A.S. President with FTP Jason Garshfield said he is running in order to provide students with an option to choose a candidate that is “a little closer to the average students and their wants and needs.”</p>\n<p>“I want the students to have a choice this year. I think it’s disappointing that there’s only one political party and I thought that to remedy that situation I would run,” Garshfield said. “I haven’t been building up my resume for three years and I think that makes me a unique candidate, as opposed to people who have been devoting themselves to A.S. and don’t really have any other interests.”</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, he would place greater importance on protecting students’ rights as opposed to forcing his agenda on them.</p>\n<p>“I think the changes that I implement would be a subtraction rather than addition because I think that ultimately my job as A.S. president is not to force my agenda on the students. My agenda is to protect the fundamental rights of the students and to treat everyone as an individual,” Garshfield said. “If that involves subtracting some things from the office and subtracting the power of the president, then I will definitely do whatever’s in my power to do so.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major running for IVP with OPP Kimia Hashemian said she wants to bring back a system called Gaucho Rewards in order to increase student participation at university and Isla Vista events.</p>\n<p>“It’s a program to increase attendance to the different events we have on campus,” Hashemian said. “Go to a sports game and get 50 points, if you go to town hall you get 100 points, and these points can be redeemed for cost-free things, such as going up Storke tower, or having lunch with the A.S. president, something like that.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major running for EVPLA with OPP Paola De La Cruz said her main focus would be to address issues concerning housing, sexual assault and community building on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am running because I want to improve the quality of life of students in Isla Vista, and really voice concerns and experiences that I went through,” De La Cruz said. “I really want to work towards creating some temporary housing on campus; then for sexual assault I want to develop and execute a campaign to battle sexual assault in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running for EVPLA with FTP Brandon Morse said medical marijuana dispensaries in I.V. could be beneficial in generating revenue for self-governance and other community-based purposes.</p>\n<p>“I think the one thing we’re missing out on is revenue streams as far as the cannabis industry,” Morse said. “I think that there are a substantial number of medical cannabis patients in the Isla Vista area, and the fact that we don’t have immediate safe access for patients is a travesty, and it is also something that we’re lacking as far as a potential revenue source to be able to support things like self-governance.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major running independently for EVPSA Mohsin Mirza said he hopes to address the issue that “the cost of school is going up while the quality is going down.”</p>\n<p>“I am running because we’re at a crossroads right now in higher education. The cost of school is going up but our quality is going down,” Mirza said. “As part of my platform I’ve got several things. The first is mobilize students against the tuition hike through educational actions leading to actions to put pressure on the governor to fund the UC’s more.”</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology major running as EVPSA with OPP Carlos Lopez said he wants to better inform students about student debt and budgeting to better involve students in discussions involving tuition increases.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I did in my second year was I put on a weeklong event called the week of revenue. It talked about student debt, how student debt has risen in the last years, and a couple of things that we can try to fight the rising and tuition,” Lopez said. “So I’m hoping to have something every single quarter to try to engage students more.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running independently for SAG Jorge Escobar said few people know about the SAG office, and publicizing their service would be one of his priorities.</p>\n<p>“The office of the Student Advocate General is relatively new, people don’t know us, but we’re a great resource on campus,” Escobar said. “One thing we want to work on is solidifying the office, making sure that we progress. We’re still learning, we want to be able to utilize our resources better.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major running independently for SAG Anais Zavala said the office gives advice and helps students with “anything that has to do with campus policies.”</p>\n<p>“If you get written up in the dorms, plagiarize, break a student code of conduct, we know what to refer you to or we can just give you advice on what to do,” Zavala said. “That’s something that I’m really familiar with, and I’d just like to let people know more about our office.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/","id":2853,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2852,2851,2850],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Financial Aid Office Backs Off of Controversial Plan","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rightsaid-PK.jpg?resize=201%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rightsaid-PK.jpg?resize=201%2C303&ssl=1","description":"The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI).","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI).</p>\n<p>An announcement reflecting the change of course to pursue a plan came Wednesday night from On-Campus senator Matthew Santos, stated after weeks of negotiations between Associated Students and the financial aid office. The idea originally involved reducing the portion of financial aid award letters slated for covering the cost of health insurance to students who waive GHI. Discussions between the financial aid office and A.S. yielded no change in the status quo.</p>\n<p>Director of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Mike Miller said in an email to A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau that the idea was to allocate funds more efficiently from students who are not using the fully designated amount for health insurance and redistributing that amount for other purposes.</p>\n<p>“The issue at hand is that approximately 50% of undergraduate students waive out of GHI and their financial aid awards are not adjusted even though the students are not incurring the GHI expense,” Miller said in an email. “Currently, financial aid recipients are able to use those funds to address other expenses. Given the rapid increase in GHI costs over the last few years, this has evolved into a significant issue. Based on our projections of past student history, we estimate a savings of about $6M in UCSB Grant if we make the revisions for GHI waivers.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and GHI advisory committee member Alex Hill said while he understood the financial aid office’s position, he believes the idea was unpopular and stood to affect a large number of students.</p>\n<p>“I understand the business perspective of the financial office and it is necessary to be prudent with any budget to make sure that they aren’t bleeding money. From their perspective, if you’re looking at their budget, they were more or less spending their budget inefficiently and they were trying to be more efficient,” Hill said. “However, their decisions do affect students directly in a way that was grossly unpopular with the student body.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy said the financial aid office required additional concrete evidence before moving forward with a formal plan on the idea.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, they lacked specific data about what are student health insurance plans and needs at the time,” Guthy said. “They were making the decision, from my perspective, on a series of interactions with students coming into the financial office, which is good, firsthand experience is really great. But based off of that they needed to conduct a formal survey and focus groups and studies with students.”</p>\n<p>Miller said in a statement that nothing would change regarding financial aid award allocations for health insurance and that the decision was reached after investigation into the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“After spending time researching the issue and looking into the ever evolving Affordable Care Act and other health insurance options UCSB students have, I determined more time was needed before we could formulate a plan that I felt comfortable with,” Miller said. “Moving forward, there will be many more conversations at the system-wide and campus levels about this issue, but for 2015-16, I have made the decision to continue our current practices.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, a concrete plan to implement reduced award letters for students who waived GHI never existed, and Miller said it was only ever an idea.</p>\n<p>“There was never an agreement to move forward with a plan to adjust financial aid awards for GHI waivers. There were simply conversations with a couple of key departments and AS members,” Miller said in an email. “From day one, we all said we wanted to be thoughtful about the issue before moving forward with a plan.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said she was pleased to hear the financial aid office would no longer consider any plans to reduce award letters and that her office would continue to discuss the financial aid situation with Miller’s office.</p>\n<p>“We have to acknowledge they’re coming from a good place. They really listen to students on this issue and I personally could not be more happy with the outcome,” Guthy said. “Students just need to be aware that this conversation is happening. This conversation will continue to happen in the next couple months.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said she believes student opposition to the idea contributed to the financial aid office’s decision to discontinue consideration on the proposed possible plan.</p>\n<p>“With more talk about it amongst the student population it became very present or obvious that students were not ready nor were they gung-ho about this whole thing,” Lau said, “and that’s why they’re slowing down the process now.”</p>\n<p>According to Jodie Nakajima, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, despite the change of direction taken by the financial aid office, she will still be waiving GHI.</p>\n<p>“I think it depends on how much they would reduce it by, but insurance is pretty expensive anyways … so I probably would still waive it regardless,” Nakajima said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/","id":2834,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2833,2832,2831],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":123,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
