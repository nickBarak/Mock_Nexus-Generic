Now, Carlton-Carew can add fashion designer and human rights advocate to her resume.</p>\n<p>The T-shirts were created by Carlton-Carew to promote the upcoming premiere of her documentary series, titled “America Show Me Your Hands,” which will be released on YouTube within the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a mini docuseries that will analyze certain social issues going on within America and what Americans think we should do to fix those issues that are occuring within our environment or our community,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just about holding each other accountable for our future.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the meaning behind the phrase “America Show Me Your Hands,” Carlton-Carew said she associated it with a mother catching her child sneaking a cookie from the cookie jar and asking them to show her their hands.</p>\n<p>“It’s more engaging that way, it’s in a loving way; I want people to be transparent with each other because I want people to have conversations [about social issues],” she said.</p>\n<p>The series will be comprised of short 15-minute films. It will spotlight relevant social and political issues circulating the country including sexism, racism, healthcare, affordable education and housing, among other topics.</p>\n<p>The first episode will address xenophobia, the dislike or fear of people from foreign countries, a topic that is one of personal interest to Carlton-Carew, whose parents are both from Sierra Leone, West Africa.</p>\n<p>A large portion of the episode will highlight the effects of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) on its recipients.</p>\n<p>“Temporary Protected Status allows certain people from certain countries to come to America if they’re seeking asylum, or their country experienced natural disasters or if it is unsafe for them to be there,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew, whose mother came to the United States under TPS in the 1990s as a result of the Sierra Leone Civil War, experienced firsthand the confusion that arises among the recipients when their status is terminated.</p>\n<p>Prior to President Trump’s administration, when a country that was originally granted TPS was deemed safe once again, the government would notify the recipients but then fail to enforce any action to send them back to their native country.</p>\n<p>They also would not provide them with the steps necessary to apply for citizenship in America, according to Carlton-Carew.</p>\n<p>Currently refugees from Haiti, El Salvador, Nepal and Honduras who have sought refuge in America to escape natural disasters and violence within their countries have been notified that they need to leave between 2019 and 2020 or face deportation, according to Carlton-Carew.</p>\n<p>Through “America Show Me Your Hands,” Carlton-Carew aims to promote transparency and accountability between Americans in regards to these intense topics.</p>\n<p>“I want empathy; I want people to be able to understand each other’s situations. The only reason why I am where I am today is because Americans in my community didn’t look at my mother and I as strangers … they embraced us as Americans should do and they made sure that we felt welcome,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>The first episode will consist primarily of Carlton-Carew’s own story in regards to xenophobia, along with news clippings and photos of children from Honduras and Nepal that she received from a photographer who traveled there.</p>\n<p>The following episode, tackling affordable housing, will feature testimonials from college students who recognize the issue in their society and have begun taking steps to effect change in their community.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew wanted to create the film series during her first year at UCSB. However, it was only recently that she decided on a specific format and film topics and began to act on her ideas.</p>\n<p>“I started getting more involved in politics, and given our political climate I thought this was the most appropriate time. I couldn’t sit on this idea any longer –– I had to pursue it,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>Her decision to become involved in A.S. was largely a result of her desire to see more film major representation within Senate.</p>\n<p>As first pro-tempore and off-campus senator, Carlton-Carew aspires to not only be a liaison between the student body and their senators but also to promote increased opportunities for student filmmakers.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew hopes to reach young adults with her T-shirts and documentaries in an effort to empower them.</p>\n<p>“I just want to empower young people to take charge of their future.

CSD postponed the decision on whether or not to include a low-income exemption with the UUT. <em>Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>I.V. voters passed the User Utility Tax (UUT) through Measure R, which was on the Santa Barbara Spring 2018 elections ballot.</p>\n<p>The UUT, an eight percent tax on electricity, gas, garbage disposal, sewage and water services, is the I.V. Community Services District’s main source of funding. It will <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19_5ItKDEy3CwUFvd-mRuIuIww-VKa3cwgk4pOAD35sM/edit#gid=1092095724\">net</a> approximately $777,000 a year for the district.</p>\n<p>The “Yes on Measure R” crew championed the tax as a way to finally give I.V. residents a voice in government following the district’s creation in Spring 2017.</p>\n<p>Prominent advocates for the tax – including I.V. CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand and I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud – campaigned on the promise of a low-income exemption for those who cannot afford the tax.</p>\n<p>Four months later, that promise remains in stasis.</p>\n<p>Brandt told the Nexus in June that the CSD was currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said in June.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD, which meets twice a month, has discussed the low-income exemption extensively at two of its meetings since UUT’s passing.</p>\n<p>However, the six-member board has not made any progress regarding the exemption and instead has discussed not implementing a low-income exemption for the tax.</p>\n<p>“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members, such as Vice President Natalie Jordan, said it is hard to determine which households in I.V. are low-income because several households only have one name on certain utilities.</p>\n<p>She pointed to her own living situation in I.V. as an example.</p>\n<p>“[My household] receive[s] a discounted rate on electricity already because we have that one [low-income] person written onto the bill,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Other members, such as director Father Jon Hedges, argued all residents should pay the tax because of the voice the I.V. CSD gives the community.</p>\n<p>“The whole premise of the CSD was participatory democracy, a voice for our community, that we not be voiceless the way we’ve been for decades,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that the cost of a small bill per month is a small price to pay.”</p>\n<p>The issue on the table during the Oct. 9 meeting was whether or not to exempt I.V.’s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vQhq8YjtkADsaqdHp8X7JumSONytqJPNLKQdu_csyms/edit#gid=0\">non-profit</a> housing providers, such as Friendship Manor and the SB Housing Co-op. The latter is composed of five houses: Newman, Merton, Bike, Manely and De Shain.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Director George Thurlow argued if one group is allowed to be exempt, such as the non-profits, then it would create problems for everyone.</p>\n<p>“Once we say, ‘Your folks don’t have to pay the four dollars a month,’ you’re gonna open the floodgates, because every student in this town is for [the exemption],” he said.</p>\n<p>The issue was tabled until February 2019, when the district will have a better sense of its finances, according to Hedges.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD is working toward “some sort of exemption or reduction,” though not necessarily a low-income exemption, Bertrand said to the Nexus following the meeting.</p>\n<p>“I wish we would address it now, but we can address it then, too,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“I struggle with this one because while [there is a] small amount of money that would be saved, it’s still something that we really — for the past few years now — mentioned some sort of utility reduction or exemption for low-income folks.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The final quote is attributed Bertrand, not Brandt. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The first of the Asks would expand this amount to three.</p>\n<p>“We do think that there’s a disconnect between students and the people who are in the power to make decisions about students,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The second of the Asks requests that UCSB must provide SASA with “the funds to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>The reach of the campaign depends on the amount of funding the university provides, Montalvo-Telford added.</p>\n<p>The third Ask says that the UCSB Title IX office “must provide an annual Public Accountability Report as modeled by the UCLA Title IX office.”</p>\n<p>UC Los Angeles’s (UCLA) <a href=\"https://equity.ucla.edu/public_accountability/public_accountability_reports/\">Public Accountability Report</a> provides “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>“I think that there’s mystery surrounding the Title IX office; we don’t really know what’s going on in there … I think that being at least transparent about the stats of what’s going on in there is comforting, as a student,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final of the Asks says UCSB “must create a paid position for a SASA member to organize an hour long conversation about consent and sexual violence.”</p>\n<p>This position would replace the current Gaucho FYI content on consent and sexual violence, and it would “act as its own subsection of Gaucho FYI.”</p>\n<p>“The way that consent is being taught at Gaucho FYI … limits the way that consent is able to be talked about,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“We don’t think that consent really stops at ‘yes means yes.’ It’s more than that,” Montolvo-Telford added. “It’s talking about, ‘What does consent actually looks like inside of the bedroom? How do we use it in practice and not just in definition?’”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford believes that the benefit of having a SASA member give the presentation is that a SASA member would have more freedom than a Gaucho FYI presenter.</p>\n<p>“We are able to include things that were necessarily restricted before,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>In theory, a member of SASA would not have these restrictions, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>SASA does not have a set number in mind for the wage of the position.</p>\n<p>The list of Asks has been endorsed by A.S. President Brooke Kopel, External Vice President of Local Affairs Jeike Meijer, Lobby Corps, I Am That Girl, Hermanos, the Armenian Student Association, Making Adventures Possible for All Students (M.A.P.A.S) and Stop the Traffik L.A.</p>\n<p>“As the first woman president that UCSB has had in the past four years, sexual assault issues are at the top of my priorities,” Kopel said in an email. “I unequivocally agreed that each and every one of those asks should and must be implemented by our university administration.”</p>\n<p>SASA is currently working on a resolution with on-campus senator Zion Solomon and off-campus senator Christian Ornelas that endorses the list of Asks, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to have it in front of Senate by next week,” Montalvo-Telford said. “We are prepared to make our argument in support.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the Asks, SASA released the <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/index.php/projects/#survey\">results of a survey</a> that was conducted during Spring Quarter 2018. The responses were collected anonymously during a two-week time frame and all participants were associated with UCSB.</p>\n<p>The survey results included data regarding sexual assault, survivors’ reasoning for not reporting, respondents’ knowledge of resources and policies and attitudes toward the university.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised to see that the reason why folks chose not to report was because that they felt that the offense was not serious enough,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The data from the survey helped SASA determine how the Asks should be structured, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“We definitely believe that all of these Asks are necessary to our campus. What they look like requires a conversation between us and the administration. All of them, in their thesis, are necessary for this campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Food Bank experienced dramatic growth at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018, which was a factor in the group’s decision to expand its service, according to A.S. Food Bank Student Coordinator Daniel Yi.</p>\n<p>“The past couple weeks we’ve been easily reaching 500 to 600 new [visitors] per day. That kind of figure is a record figure compared to last year,” Yi said. “That was the peak we were hitting last year. And the first few weeks of this quarter, we’re already at that peak.”</p>\n<p>The record increase in clients has been challenging for the Food Bank, according to Yi.</p>\n<p>“I have to find the balance between supplying enough food to all our clients but also work[ing] within the limitations of the actual space we have,” Yi said.</p>\n<p>“I think opening a new day and getting more supply pickups should help smooth things out and satisfy our clients’ needs.”</p>\n<p>The Food Bank was also able to hire more employees to make the expanded hours possible.</p>\n<p>“I currently have 11 active student staff members on my schedule to maintain the pantry and move all of the food –– a handful have been hired in the recent summer and spring quarters, and others have been around for longer,” he said.</p>\n<p>Yi said the location of the Food Bank has historically made it difficult for students to be aware of its existence and informed on its purpose.</p>\n<p>“We’re tucked away on the third floor of the UCen, so people might just not know about the food resources available to them at this campus.”</p>\n<p>Outreach by the Food Bank and its partners could be a factor in its recent growth, according to Yi.</p>\n<p>“I guess over the last year, our Food Bank committee and a lot of our partners have been doing a really good job of promoting the Food Bank and promoting our resources,” Yi said.</p>\n<p>Yi said the Food Bank has been using social media to market new developments and products.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been promoting a lot of the exciting items we’re receiving at the Food Bank, as well as special events with our partners. I think some of our developments, like our previous space expansion, new refrigerators and microwaves have also generated quite a bit of buzz for us.”</p>\n<p>The Food Bank is funded by a combination of grants and a lock-in student fee, according to Yi. Within student fees, undergraduate students pay five dollars and graduate students pay three dollars at the beginning of each quarter.</p>\n<p>“We have received grants from TGIF and Global Food Initiative in order to pay for our refrigerators and van,” Food Bank Coordinator Rodolfo Herrera said. “A.S. Finance and Business has also passed for other capital investments in our space.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Food Bank supplies most of the food to the A.S. Food Bank, Herrera said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank’s status as a non-profit allows the organization to receive special prices for assorted dry goods, low prices such as six cents per pound of bread and free produce.</p>\n<p>The Food Bank was seeing roughly 5,000 pounds of food moving in and out before opening on Fridays. With the new hours, this has increased.</p>\n<p>“With Friday open, we are now picking up food five days a week, which should bring us up to around 7,500 to 8,000 pounds per week,” Yi said.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article has been updated to clarify that the A.S. Food Bank does not charge students for food, but receives their goods from the Santa Barbara County Food Bank at a discounted price, and to clarify the number of visitors they receive a day. The price of the bread has also been corrected. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Daily Nexus archives</em></p></div>\n<p>In response to the demands set forth by the protesters, the Department of Black Studies was established.</p>\n<p>The creation of that department paved the way for additional departments such as the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies, the Department of Feminist Studies and the Department of Asian American Studies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think in retrospect that we fully understood or comprehended the significance and the lifetime gravity that that event represented,” Murad Rahman, chair of the Black Student Union (BSU) in 1968, said.</p>\n<p>“We certainly by no means did we know and fully understand all of it … maybe until years and years after that, in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>Rahman remembers the events of Oct. 14 that year clearly.</p>\n<p>He and the 11 other students shouldered uncertainty, risk and, most of all, unwavering resolve as they took over North Hall.</p>\n<p>At the time, North Hall held the mainframe computer for the entire UC system and was considered “the most critical point” of the campus, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Rahman and other students attended UCSB during a time of tumultuous social and political climate. Significant moments, such as the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy as well as the rise of prominence of Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement, created the backdrop against which students experienced college life.</p>\n<p>Being among the small number of African American students at the time provided a difficult environment to navigate, Cynthia Davis, secretary for BSU in 1968, recalled.</p>\n<p>“There was a[n] identity crisis because we were such a minority there on campus,” Davis said. “Because of that fact, sort of being isolated like that … we tried to find ways where we could group together to support one another.”</p>\n<p>BSU was an important avenue for African American students to support each other and discuss the challenges they faced as students at UCSB and a minority race in the 1960s, according to Davis.</p>\n<p>Students of BSU worked to raise awareness about issues faced by African American students and fight for changes they felt would benefit their community and black communities throughout the nation, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Dalton Nezey, a football player in 1968 and one of North Hall Takeover participants, joined forces with Rahman and other BSU members in discussion about what the school needed to be doing better for its black students.</p>\n<p>Several of those discussions revolved around the mistreatment of black athletes on the football team, which included the lack of financial aid given to black athletes in comparison to their white counterparts, the use of derogatory language by coaching staff and the general lack of respect black students were given.</p>\n<p>“We felt that we were being treated differently, and … in that conversation about football, we started looking at the structure of the campus,” Nezey said.</p>\n<p>These complaints, coupled with “racial insensitivity, [and] racial illiteracy” on campus as well as the national social strife at the time, were the final catalyst for the North Hall Takeover, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>In secret – from the public as well as most members of the BSU at the time – Rahman, Nezey and other students devised a plan to secure the computer center at North Hall and demand changes at UCSB from the chancellor at the time, Vernon Cheadle.</p>\n<p>Students planned the “high-risk operation” two weeks in advance.</p>\n<p>BSU members located all the exits in the building, prepared for attempted infiltration from police and threats of violence. They also determined how they would communicate and negotiate with key players on the outside.</p>\n<p>Even on the morning of the Takeover, some of the protestors, though resolved in their mission, were apprehensive about what the rest of the day would entail.</p>\n<p>“We knew we were doing the right thing … the question was, how fearful were we of the consequences? That was the issue,” Thomas Crenshaw, one of the protestors, said.</p>\n<p>“Were we fearful? Yeah, we were fearful. Were we afraid? Yeah, we were afraid. There were a lot of us who met to go into North Hall. Only 12 of us showed up.”</p>\n<p>The 12 students arrived at North Hall around 6 a.m. on Oct. 14, when they anticipated the halls would be empty of workers and students. The protestors convinced the few technicians who were present to leave after explaining the gravity of the situation about to take place.</p>\n<p>The students had coordinated a team on the outside to facilitate negotiations at the chancellor’s office while the 12 remained barricaded inside North Hall.</p>\n<p>Booker Banks, another member of the 12 inside the building, addressed the crowd gathered outside the building throughout the day. He kept them both informed and entertained during the negotiations.</p>\n<p>“[Banks] was very, very crucial in making the whole operation a success and in winning over the minds and hearts of students [so] that what we were doing inside and the whole operation was a positive and constructive event,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>It was late afternoon when the 12 received word the chancellor’s office had agreed to the demands.</p>\n<p>“It was a moment of celebration, a moment of relief because we didn’t know whether or not our demands were going to be met,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>50 years later, the North Hall Takeover remains one of the most significant actions take by BSU and has had reverberating effects on campus.</p>\n<p>But the advancements set in motion by these students’ actions were far greater than they could have imagined at the time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84425\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84425\" data-attachment-id=\"84425\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/50-years-ago-12-students-and-the-takeover-that-changed-everything/50th-anniversary_online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"50th anniversary_ONLINE-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84425\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84425\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several of the 12 protestors gathered at UCSB to celebrate the Takeover’s 50th anniversary. <em>Courtesy of Professor Jeffrey Stewart</em></p></div>\n<p>“What’s really amazing to me is to look at all the pictures and see yourself in these pictures at 18, 19 years old not realizing that you’re contributing to history at the time but that you have made history,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>“You feel very proud that you happen to be in the right place at the right time to make such a positive contribution.”</p>\n<p>Many of the participants cite the Takeover as a significant moment in their lives, both shaping their time at UCSB as well as the future they would go on to have.</p>\n<p>“[My involvement] shows and is an indication to my children and my grandchildren as to sacrifices that sometimes have to made in order for progress to be attained,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Rahman now works as a supervising case manager for a community organization in Los Angeles working toward gang prevention.</p>\n<p>Davis also attributes her time in BSU as “stirr[ing] up in me the importance to learn more about my heritage, to be proud of who I was and to be in a position to fight for basic civil rights.”</p>\n<p>She currently works as an assistant professor at Charles R.

the Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs special election after it was unable to meet the 16 percent voter threshold by Thursday.</p>\n<p>The deadline to vote is now Nov. 2.</p>\n<p>Only 836 students, or 3.5 percent of the student body, had voted in the special election as of Wednesday evening, according to Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria.</p>\n<p>In order for the election results to be valid, 16 percent of the student body has to vote in the election by the end of the extended week.</p>\n<p>At last week’s Associated Students (A.S.) Senate meeting, Renteria and Elections Board member Davis Quan said they created this threshold by looking back at previous special election voting record turnouts.</p>\n<p>Renteria and Quan previously said if the election is unable to meet the threshold by the original Thursday deadline, they would extend the deadline by a week.</p>\n<p>If the threshold is still not met by Nov. 2, the position of External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) will be left vacant until the Spring Quarter 2019 Election.</p>\n<p>The position is currently vacant following the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualification</a> of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales last spring.</p>\n<p>Currently, the only candidate on the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/madeline-loudon-is-sole-declared-candidate-for-evpsa-special-election/\">ballot</a> is third-year history of public policy major Madeline Loudon, the runner-up in last spring’s election.</p>\n<p>Due to the office’s vacancy over the summer, the Senate passed a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-split-evpsa-duties/\">resolution</a> in July to split the duties and funds of the office between the External Vice President for Local Affairs, the Student Advocate General, the A.S.

Main space as a “safe space for the workers to decompress” for the duration of the strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to have the institutional support behind the workers who are really just asking for fair wages and stable benefits,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also asks the Senate to formally endorse the strike and requests the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) have a representative at the strike to offer OSA resources and services for the workers on strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) Grecia Martinez will also be purchasing $600 worth of food and beverages for the workers through the Senate’s unallocated funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate decided to double the original amount requested ($300) after learning that the strike is expecting approximately 500 students per day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also calls upon A.S. President Brooke Kopel and Chancellor Henry T. Yang to write a letter in support of the strike to Janet Napolitano, UCOP (UC Office of the President), the UC Board of Regents and UC Labor Relations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will readily write the letter and consult the authors of the resolution and students that worked on it for input on the letter,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second resolution, authored by Palmerin and Briseno, calls for an A.S. “work stoppage” in support of the strike. It promises to compensate the A.S. student workers who sign in at the strike and miss their shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. entities that will be affected by the work stoppage include the A.S Bike Shop, A.S. Recycling, A.S. Department of Public Worms, A.S. Zero Waste Committee, A.S. Publications and the A.S Main building, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facilities including the A.S. Food Bank and the A.S. Legal Resource Center will not be closed due to the nature of the services they provide for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also requires no police presence in A.S. Main for the duration of the strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third resolution, authored by Cornejo and Uribe, encourages student workers to strike in solidarity and “endorses the usage of any and all AS resources in providing aid” to students who do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building upon the resolution presented by Solomon and Toubian, this resolution also requires OSA to offer several services including “information relating to University rights, protocols, and procedures, information on strikes and protests rights and procedures, information on appeals processes, and referrals to local legal representation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) plans to strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25 to protest a “year and a half of deadlocked negotiations [and] concerns about growing racial and gender disparities within UC’s workforce,” according to a press release from AFSCME spokesperson John de los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numerous undergraduate and graduate students spoke at public forum, calling for the A.S. Senate to pass the resolutions and personally show their support by showing up at the picket line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s time for you to support us, so that we can support you,” Juan Donato, lead groundskeeper and Member Action Team for AFSCME, said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

It also focuses these resources toward students from low-income communities, with the hope of giving them a higher chance of attending college and becoming productive members of the workforce.</p>\n<p>“We have some serious issues on the planet that must be solved soon, and students with a good education can be positioned to be part of that solution,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>Ortiz, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1985, originally got involved with the organization as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>He worked as a tutor for the program during his college years and went on to take a temporary job doing outreach following his graduation.</p>\n<p>After continuing his education at Cal State Northridge and the University of La Verne, he eventually returned to UCSB in 2000 to become EAOP Director.</p>\n<p>“We need more students to participate in higher ed. Our economy needs a highly educated workforce and we are helping that process,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>When the EAOP was first created, its intent was to diversify the student body of UC campuses by providing resources to racial minorities.</p>\n<p>Over the years, its focus has shifted to targeting low-income, first-generation students who do not have readily available access to college services. The program now spans three counties and soon will be serving 11 high schools.</p>\n<p>“The idea was to increase college enrollment rates from these schools that were usually associated with low-income communities that don’t always have the same resources to prepare for college,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>With over 2,000 students enrolled in its cohort, the program’s services reach a wide range of students, including those at the middle and elementary school levels.</p>\n<p>EAOP’s welcoming atmosphere is evident through its dedicated staff. Mirka Lopez, a first-generation student herself, works as college-site coordinator for the program.</p>\n<p>“[The EAOP] gives them that motivation and encouragement because sometimes they don’t think they belong at a UC, or they’ve never set foot on a college campus,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>“Through this program they get the opportunity to explore their options and learn what kind of resources there are.”</p>\n<p>The program also has several student interns on staff, allowing UCSB students to serve as role models for under-represented teenagers.</p>\n<p>For Daniel Segura, a second-year sociology major and EAOP intern, the program is especially meaningful.</p>\n<p>“It means a lot to me because I was a part of EAOP myself in high school, so my first experiences with college were through the program,” Segura said.</p>\n<p>“Now that we’re interns, we get to see those effects on other kids, seeing them believe that college is actually possible because someone like them actually made it.”</p>\n<p>However, EAOP has endured its share of struggles over the years, including several budget and staff cuts.</p>\n<p>Staff went from 23 to nine in the mid-2000s, and EAOP suffered additional monetary cuts due to the fluctuating economy, according to Ortiz.</p>\n<p>EAOP began a using new budget model in 2007 that shares costs with its school sites to help run the program. They now use a “Dual Service Model,” aiming resources toward all students, regardless of their indicated college interest level.</p>\n<p>“So in essence, we cover the entire school. We don’t just raise the cohort’s college-going rate, we aim at raising the graduating class’s college-going rates,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>UCSB EAOP also recently trained UCLA and UCR EAOPs to replicate its model, hoping to impact not only the surrounding community but also the state as a whole.</p>\n<p>The program’s influence was made clear on Friday during a college-readiness event, which gave dozens of low-income and first-generation high school students a first look at UCSB’s campus.</p>\n<p>During this event, UCSB undergraduate volunteers gave tours and provided advice to the aforementioned students.</p>\n<p>“[EAOP] is changing the world one school at a time,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Lopez’s first name is Mirka, not Lirka. </em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: UCSB EAOP is training other UC’s to “replicate” its model, not “respect” its model. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

but it was changed for the preservation of local wildlife. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) Board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/\">discussed plans</a> to open the park in February, according to Jacob Lebell, the Chairman of the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD).</p>\n<p>Construction for the park was expected to begin during spring. However, the construction was delayed until August, Lebell said.</p>\n<p>About 30 members of the I.V. community were in attendance at the grand opening, alongside four IVRPD Board members, including Pegeen Soutar and Matias Eusterbrock. Both worked alongside Lebell during the construction process.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD made several changes to the park in order to made it dog-compatible, including securing the perimeter with fences and altering the landscape to make it a safer space, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>“[The IVRPD] secur[ed] the fence in the back and [ran] a fence in the front with a double gate, as well as a vehicle access gate, and then we took out all of the rubber multrain on the place structure and replaced it with wood chips,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>The board hopes to add several more features to the park, including sprinklers, tables, an additional mutt mitt dispenser, a tunnel bridge, ramps and slides, according to Soutar.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the biggest setback the IVRPD faced in establishing the park was “finding the right park that would work… having enough space and [finding] a neighborhood it wouldn’t be a problem in.”</p>\n<p>The IVRPD initially planned to create the dog park in Anisq’Oyo Park. However, it was found unsuitable due to incompatible aspects of the terrain, according to Soutar.</p>\n<p>With the growing population of dogs in I.V., concerns with the safety of residents has risen, Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD is providing a dog training course that is free and accessible to all residents in I.V. The board is working with Jeike Meijer, Associated Students external vice president of local affairs, to help fund this program.</p>\n<p>The dog training courses will be every Sunday at 11 a.m. at Sueno Park, beginning on Oct. 21. A trainer from “Four on the Floor,” a locally based training company, will teach the dogs a basic set of behaviors.</p>\n<p>The training course’s’ main objective is to “help students afford an opportunity to train their dogs and also have a better relationship with their dog,” Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>In addition to the training courses, the board would like to work with Progressive Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.), a national charitable organization, to offer a mobile health van that provides dogs with medical resources such as vaccinations, spaying and neutering.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the board hopes to “build a community around dogs in I.V.” that helps foster a welcoming environment, Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p><em>Katie Wolf contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84361\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84361\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/","id":4254,"author":{"id":241,"name":"Medlyn Grasheyella"},"related":[4253,4252,4251],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pardall Carnival Brings Together I.V.
