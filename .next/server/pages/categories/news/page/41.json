Attorney General Ali Suebert represented Mukai in the case against Salari, arguing that Senator Salari violated legal code by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/on-campus-senator-yasamin-salari-admits-to-living-off-campus-in-violation-of-legal-code/\">living off-campus</a> and that she is unable “to serve and adequately represent her constituents,” according to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/former-cu-co-chair-files-judicial-council-petition-about-on-campus-senator-salari-living-off-campus/\">petition.</a></p>\n<p>“We feel that it is unfair that someone is able to run for a position and campaign as an on-campus senator, getting votes from on-campus students, when other people are running for the same election under the same legal code expecting to have the same laws that they were held to,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Former Off-Campus Senator Alexandra Gessesse, representing Salari, defended Salari on the basis that her off-campus living arrangement does not inhibit her ability to represent her on-campus constituents and that her extenuating financial circumstances prevented Salari from living on-campus.</p>\n<p>“Understanding that she doesn’t live within her constituency is real and is a serious matter,” Gessesse said. “But Senator Salari has actively and continuously… supported the constituency in which she is elected to live in.”</p>\n<p>Salari said she based her decision to live off campus on her financial aid reward and changes in her family’s ability to pay for her tuition.</p>\n<p>“I had the fullest intention of living on-campus when I found out I was elected for Senate, however this changed after my election as I received my financial aid package,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Citing financial struggles, Salari said that she and her family “decided that taking out more loans would not be beneficial to my education and long-term academic endeavors.”</p>\n<p>As a result of this, Salari found that her only option would be to live in her sorority house, where her financial aid would cover the costs.</p>\n<p>“I had to fall back on living in my sorority house in order to make sure that my financial aid would cover all the costs for my housing,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s attempt to remove her from her Senate position “inherently violates the student bill of rights” in that it would “be taking a leadership position away from an elected student due to circumstances completely out of our hands,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>“Where’s the sense of decency and understanding that students face different struggles?” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Gessesse referred to past incidents in which A.S. Senate granted one-time exceptions to senators who lived out of their respective constituency.</p>\n<p>“We [should] ask ourselves what makes Senator Salari different between the one-time exceptions that have been granted in the past,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>But Suebert contends that Senate did not have the authority to grant such exceptions, which would circumvent the power of Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“The only person who is allowed to make exceptions to Legal Code… is the attorney general or the Judicial Council,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Suebert said that while Senate can re-write or amend Legal Code for future situations, they cannot grant exceptions intended to bypass current Legal Code. These checks and balances of powers with A.S. are designed for fairness among senators, which she said need to be maintained.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to make sure that all students that ran in spring election during the campaign, who also may have faced financial hardship, still are held under the same legal obligations of other students who also ran,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>The petitioning team called in Lea Toubian, a current on-campus senator, to testify about how living within her constituency affected her ability to fulfill on-campus duties.</p>\n<p>“I think it keeps me more attuned. Since I’m still living [on-campus], it’s pretty relevant to me, but it is difficult to reach all parts of the res-hall community. I think that’s why we have like four different positions,” Tubian said.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I wouldn’t have been able to reach [students living at San Rafael] if I wasn’t an on-campus senator.”</p>\n<p>Toubian also said that running as an on-campus senator as a freshman in the Spring Quarter 2018 election, like Salari, was easier for herself since she already lived in on-campus housing and was familiar with the on campus student community.</p>\n<p>Gessesse countered that although Salari lives off-campus, she is capable of serving her constituency, which can be seen through her involvement in projects such as bring rollover dining common swipes to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Gessesse additionally argued that Salari had, in fact, adhered to Legal Code by meeting with A.S. Elections Board in regards to her living situation. A.S. Elections Board subsequently dismissed the complaint, according to Gessesse.</p>\n<p>Salari’s transparency in regards to her off-campus living situation during a Senate meeting in Fall Quarter 2018 testifies to her compliance with Legal Code and fulfillment of duties as an on-campus senator. Despite living off-campus, Salari “followed all policies that were in place when she was elected,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The responding team also brought On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon to testify about their experience as an off-campus senator. Solomon testified that the projects they worked on as a senator are determined more by her personal passions than her designated constituency.</p>\n<p>Solomon also testified that Salari’s accessibility to on-campus students was “better than my own,” citing that Salari’s office hours are held on campus and that Salari specifically focuses on on-campus issues.</p>\n<p>At the end of closing statements, Salari asked that the Judicial Council review her case in light of the work she has done for her constituency and the financial circumstances she faced.</p>\n<p>“My work should matter more. That’s what affects students more. That’s what students care about, not where I live and where I can’t afford to live,” Salari said. “My work is directly affecting students and wanting to remove will end those projects that are positively affecting them.”</p>\n<p>Salari also asked that the Judicial Council review her case as an indicator of the changes in Legal Code needed to accommodate the current student body.</p>\n<p>“This is an opportunity for the council to respond to the changing needs of student body and interpret Legal Code accordingly.”</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or sofiamejias@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

We are already looking into expansion… We are actually looking at a Hollywood shop, so we are in the works of getting that set up,” Gabriel English, general manager of Mojo, said.</p>\n<p>According to English, the Hollywood expansion would be in collaboration with Mojo’s business partners, who would also like to start another store in Oxnard.</p>\n<p>Mojo’s success can be partly attributed to the variety of Asian food and drink on the menu. Aside from the typical drinks that one would expect at a boba shop, Mojo also entices customers by offering an ever-changing assortment of Asian fusion snacks, including popcorn chicken, spicy Korean wings and kimchi fries.</p>\n<p>“The latest thing we are thinking about adding to the snacks section is fried cheese wontons. It’s a personal recipe of mine, and has a lot of vegetables and cheese inside it,” English said.</p>\n<p>Customers are attracted to the store by the welcoming environment, as well as the employees’ upbeat nature and passion about boba.</p>\n<p>One such employee is Jeene Yim, a second-year art and biology double major who works as a tea specialist at Mojo. Yim began working at Mojo when it opened last summer, and feels that it makes up for the lack of quality Asian food in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am passionate about boba and I am passionate about my culture,” Yim said. “I wanted to see more Asian culture in I.V.. We do have a lot of Asian food places in I.V., but I really didn’t feel it was good… I really liked boba, and this is the reason I was really excited to start working here.”</p>\n<p>Five months later, Yim has found a sense of community within the walls of the Mojo kitchen, a community that she feels shines through to customers everyday.</p>\n<p>“We have a desire to bring good boba to I.V. so we are always trying to improve ourselves and bring out the best drinks. The close knit community in the back between our workers shows through, and that’s what makes us different.”</p>\n<p>To Yim and countless other UCSB students, Mojo has become a reliable destination for high quality boba.</p>\n<p>“Everytime I’m walking on campus, I hear someone say ‘I want boba, do you want to go to Mojo?’ and I feel like before that, there wasn’t really a certain spot that they would say. When I hear that it makes me happy. I am so proud to work here,” Yim said.</p>\n<p>Mojo Teahouse is located at 6578 Trigo Road.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 20, 2019 issue of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Legal Code, the governing document of all A.S. entities, requires executives to complete at least six units per quarter — making them at least a half-time student — during the spring quarter in which they are elected and each of the subsequent fall, winter and spring quarters of their term.</p>\n<p>The executives — current S.A.G. Grecia Martinez, former EVPSA Kristin Hsu, former President James Villarreal ‘16 and former EVPSA Melvin Singh ‘15 – either withdrew or canceled their enrollment or took fewer than the required number of units at some point during their terms, according to student enrollment records.</p>\n<p>A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi said she is currently investigating Martinez’s withdrawal from Fall Quarter 2018 to determine whether there is cause for a Judicial Council case. Martinez said she believes she did not violate any requirement.</p>\n<p>Martinez withdrew from Fall Quarter 2018, Hsu canceled her Spring Quarter 2018 and Villarreal dropped below half-time during Winter Quarter 2016. Singh canceled Winter Quarter 2015 and there is no record of him attending UCSB in Spring Quarter 2015.</p>\n<p>Last spring, former EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> before being sworn in after it was discovered she had canceled her classes for the quarter, making her ineligible for her position.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if A.S. executives from previous years would have been allowed to serve if it came to light that they were taking fewer than six credits.</p>\n<p>Executive officers receive $3,000 per quarter – taken from student fees and paid directly to their BARC accounts — for serving the student body.</p>\n<p>Cindy Lopez, A.S. assistant director for finance and budget, confirmed that all executives who the <em>Nexus</em> found had withdrawn or canceled their enrollment or dropped below half-time over the last five years received their $3,000 stipends each quarter and that none had returned the money.</p>\n<p>Students who withdraw before the beginning of a quarter have their registration canceled and receive a full refund, the UCSB Office of the Registrar <a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/registration-enrollment/registration-enrollment/withdraw-from-the-university\">website</a> says. It is unclear what Hsu and Singh, the executives who canceled their quarters, used the $3,000 for.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez directed all questions regarding consequences for failing to meet eligibility requirements to Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>Raymond Alonso, who leads the Judicial Council, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>“What the Legal Code is missing are the consequences, if any, that come with not being enrolled as a student,” A.G. Safadi told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Martinez withdrew on Dec. 7, the last day of instruction for Fall Quarter 2018. Hsu declined to comment. Singh and Villarreal did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Records also show that two other executives, former A.S. President Hieu Le ‘18 and former S.A.G. Josephine Ampaw ‘17, did not complete the minimum six units for their respective quarters.</p>\n<p>However, Le withdrew from Spring Quarter 2018 about six days after his term had ended and his successor, current A.S. President Brooke Kopel, had taken office. Le declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Ampaw retroactively withdrew from two of her classes after the end of Fall Quarter 2016, citing a personal family emergency and a desire to protect her GPA.</p>\n<p>“At the time that I was doing S.A.G., I was in those classes,” Ampaw said in an interview. “It’d be important to also state that regardless of a family emergency, I still worked as S.A.G., and I still served the student population.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said she had not been aware of the executives who had withdrawn or canceled their enrollment or taken fewer than six units until she was informed by the <em>Nexus</em>. She said executives may not have known they had dipped below the six-unit minimum and that she wished she had known so she and other A.S. staffers could have provided them with resources and support.</p>\n<p>Lopez and Marquez are responsible for checking executives’ enrollment status before paying them, but Legal Code does not require them to check their enrollment status throughout the year.</p>\n<p>A.S. senators, BCU officers and all other non-executives who are paid by the association have their enrollment checked at the end of each quarter, making it more likely that a change in enrollment status would be caught and their honoraria affected, Lopez said.</p>\n<p>The $3,000 stipend for executives — originally intended to cover all or part of tuition — is paid before each quarter starts, on Sept. 15, Dec. 15 and March 15 for fall, winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>Marquez said that her job is to check an executive’s enrollment before paying them, and “outside of that, I would imagine that it’s on them to report it or give it back.”</p>\n<p>S.A.G. Martinez, who withdrew from the university while serving during the Fall Quarter 2018 but is currently enrolled, maintained that she did not violate the Legal Code and said there is a “gray area” in the eligibility clause.</p>\n<p>She argued that since the clause for executives falls under the eligibility portion of Legal Code, the by-laws serve as expectations for candidates running for positions, not obligations to be upheld.</p>\n<p>“This is supported by the fact that the clauses included in those same sections are all worded in language concerning a candidate’s [eligibility] for an election,” she wrote in a message after her interview.</p>\n<p>Martinez said Legal Code should be clarified so that expectations and exceptions for executives are clearly outlined.</p>\n<p>If a Judicial Council case were filed against her, Martinez said it would “spark a bigger conversation about what should be done in special situations like this,” but she doesn’t believe it would be the right step.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe I’m in violation,” Martinez said. “I mean, I was a student. I did my job and I was a student at the same time.”</p>\n<p>A full version of A.S. Legal Code can be viewed below.

id=\"caption-attachment-84758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Food for All Coalition held its first meeting at the Biko Garage on Friday. <em>Laila Voss / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The coalition – made up of various students groups dedicated to fighting food insecurity – was created last October following the UCSB Food Security and Sustainable Food Systems Leadership Retreat.</p>\n<p>“[The retreat] was awesome; it was having everyone together because that never happens [and] we were drafting different ideas,” Michaela Austin said, a fourth-year sociology and environmental studies double major and student ambassador for the UC Global Food Initiative, said.</p>\n<p>The retreat brought together student organizations including the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank, CalFresh, the UC Global Food Initiative, the Edible Campus Program, FoodCycling, Food, Nutrition, and Basic Skills Program, the Food Security Taskforce Student Reps, ECOalition and Food Security Peer Advisors.</p>\n<p>For Austin, who presided over Friday’s meeting, the goal of the coalition was obvious.</p>\n<p>“[The purpose is] very simple. Update each other, build coalition[s] and again, the goal is to get food insecurity on campus to as low a rate as possible,” Austin said. “If there is a problem we all agree on, let’s go to the UC with a unified voice.”</p>\n<p>Some of the positive updates and successful programs on- and off-campus were discussed at the opening of the meeting as well.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Etaat highlighted the achievements of the CalFresh Advocacy Team and the A.S. Food Bank. He explained that the CalFresh Advocacy Team had over 76 engagement activities during Fall Quarter 2018, which included tabling and enrollment parties.</p>\n<p>“We got well over 2,000 people enrolled in CalFresh that we know of through the program and this year’s benchmark is 6,000,” Etaat, a fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major and USDA Food Insecurity Research intern, said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, several students also discussed the accessibility of food security and sustainability programs are to underserved students. Marilu Bedolla, a fourth-year language, culture and society major, noted that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients are unable to access CalFresh.</p>\n<p>Due to their ineligibility for the federal program, which has no locally funded alternative, undocumented students remain neglected, Marilu emphasized.</p>\n<p>“That is a constant issue that we don’t know what to do with it. CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?” Austin replied.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Right now, the main things we have been pushing [are] what we do have on campus, which are the food pantries and free prepared meals.”</p>\n<p>Jack Greenberg, a third-year cultural anthropology major and employee at the I.V. Food Co-op, brought up the possibility of having a plot of land in the <a href=\"http://ucsbosl.orgsync.com/org/ghgp/home\">Greenhouse and Garden project</a> to serve the undocumented population.</p>\n<p>“One of my friends is looking to start an undocumented plot in the Greenhouse and Garden project … hopefully that will be a resource also where it can be already paid for and once it grows actual food can be [made available].”</p>\n<p>Those in attendance also expressed concern about CalFresh availability at on-campus convenience stores, stating that the Arbor remains the only on-campus institution to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/\">accept the program</a>.</p>\n<p>The lack of whole foods, particularly raw fruits and vegetables, at the Arbor was another point of concern with food availability for CalFresh recipients.</p>\n<p>Students also discussed the closure of the UC Global Food Initiative, which was intended as a short-term kickstart for campuses to address food security.</p>\n<p>“We still have to do that work; we want [those programs] to be funded — it’s not a given,” Austin noted.</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition is in the process of becoming a permanent standing committee under A.S. with support from A.S. Senators Anthony Hernandez, Rafael Cornejo, Gabriella Shofet and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/\">Sydney Karmes-Wainer</a>.</p>\n<p>“We accept everyone who wants to come, whether they’re on-campus organizations or off-campus organizations [and] as a standing committee under A.S., you get all the benefits of A.S. as well,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>Hernandez wants to work on increasing turnout for the meetings. He noted his concerns about having a low turnout of students since the meetings are scheduled for Fridays.</p>\n<p>“We thought about having a night market while we have the meeting since it’s Friday night and people are going to [Del Playa]… We want to build a culture around it, so that way people know about [Food for All].”</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition holds biweekly Friday meetings at Biko Garage from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>Caleb Brown is a reporter at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-86267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The theater troupe spent weeks before the event tabling in the Arbor and inviting students to attend the show. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe President, Jalia Carlton-Carew, said auditions and initial preparations for the production began mid-Fall Quarter 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though these pieces are from the ‘90s, they still hold truth because they were still pieces inspired by people’s lived experiences at that time,” Carlton-Carew, a third-year film and media studies major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The casting process produced an array of people who could accurately portray the stories in “The Vagina Monologues,” according to Carlton-Carew.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes we have random people who just saw the show, like maybe the year before… I was just so interested after watching the show my first year that I knew I had to be a part of it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Carlton-Carew handles most of the logistics of the production, she will also be performing a self-written Herstory entitled “When I Was Seven,” in which she discusses her personal experience of black femininity in the U.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really important culturally for people to be aware of all the topics that we talk about because they play into a wide range of stories… Pieces from the original monologues still relate today,” Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe Vice President, Kate Rossb, said she was inspired to become part of the production when she first saw the show her freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, [the show is] about people. We do target the female experience, but we also target nonbinary folk,” Ross said. “A lot of our pieces reflect cisgender women and trans women — a real variety of people and diverse experiences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inclusion of a wide range of speakers, characters and actors makes “The Vagina Monologues” and Herstories influential on a college campus such as UCSB, Ross said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a special quality about seeing familiar faces on stage performing, Ross noted, saying that one of the ways in which the monologues succeed is in their ability to portray a spectrum of perspectives through real and relatable people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easier to distance yourself when it’s someone else’s words coming out of people’s mouths, but when you’re seeing someone up there, telling their story, and they’re your peers or it’s your sister or your friend or your friend’s friend, it definitely connects you more [to the story],” Ross said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Vagina Monologues” also provide an space for open discussions about current political and social dilemmas. This is one of the most important contributions “The Vagina Monologues” makes to the community, Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have these issues, but we don’t talk about them… I think it’s important to recognize what your peers are still going through even if you don’t see it on the day-to-day.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given our political climate now, you can’t afford to say something is ‘not your problem,’ even if it doesn’t pertain to you directly because the world is so interconnected.

id=\"caption-attachment-86227\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vargas discussed several topics, most notably the concept of “home.” <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Margaret Klawunn, the vice chancellor for UC Santa Barbara’s Student Affairs, spoke briefly before the lecture, explaining that its purpose was to zero in on the diversity of undocumented people not often represented in the media.</p>\n<p>Professor Lisa Sun-Hee Park, chair of the department of Asian-American Studies at UCSB, introduced Vargas by highlighting the significance of his lecture.</p>\n<p>“Almost thirty 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have made borders and walls essential fixture[s] of our national identity,” Park said.</p>\n<p>“It is an ineffectual shortcut and unimaginative copout from dealing with the realities of a global world.”</p>\n<p>Vargas’ appearance comes at a time when the nation approaches the possibility of another government shutdown over funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall.</p>\n<p>Vargas referenced this topic in his opening.</p>\n<p>“It’s really a privilege to be here tonight, considering the government may shut down again in the next couple of days, because we can’t seem to want to talk about immigration without talking about walls,” he said as he began his remarks to the crowd.</p>\n<p>The theme of the night’s lecture was “home.” Vargas used his allotted time to attempt to tease out the contradictions in how “home” is conceptualized as an undocumented immigrant.</p>\n<p>Vargas started the discussion by bringing up a seemingly trivial Bank of America email he received about his readiness to purchase a home.</p>\n<p>“I saw this email on my iPhone, and the subject line is, ‘Ready to buy a home?,’ and Trump had just gotten elected President,” he said. “At that point I heard from at least 30 undocumented people of all ages who are considering leaving the country.”</p>\n<p>Vargas said he had seriously considered leaving the United States for Canada, citing the prevalence of Filipinos in Toronto and the famous film festival named after the city.</p>\n<p>Then he received a letter from the chief of staff for Nancy Pelosi, current Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, inviting him to attend Trump’s first State of the Union as her guest.</p>\n<p>He spoke about his decision to publish an essay for the <i>Washington Post </i>jointly with his attendance, saying he felt it was risky considering Trump’s attitude toward immigrants, legal or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Vargas puts his contention to those opposed to his existence plainly, sharing the opening line of his previously published essay with the audience: “This is my country, too.”</p>\n<p>Vargas read aloud a passage from his essay explaining why he felt compelled to attend the State of the Union despite earlier considering relocating to Canada.</p>\n<p>“I decided to show up tonight [at the first State of the Union address] because that’s what immigrants, undocumented and documented, do: We show up. Despite the obvious risks and palpable fear we show up to work, to school, to church, to our communities, in big cities and rural towns.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86226\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86226\" data-attachment-id=\"86226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/activist-jose-vargas-comes-to-campbell-hall-discusses-experiences-as-an-undocumented-immigrant/immigration_riley-esguerra_online-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1405&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Immigration_Riley Esguerra_ONLINE-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=888%2C624&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86226\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=888%2C624\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86226\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Vargas stressed the importance the immigration explosion presents historically, soberly noting the inability of “native-born” Americans to have this pressing conversation surrounding undocumented immigration.</p>\n<p>“This country can barely have a conversation about [the] Black Lives Matter Movement without having a panic attack. This country can’t even talk about Native Americans with any sort of nuance and any sort of import,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we’re going to expect that this country can talk about 43 million people? It’s not a surprise that we are where we are.”</p>\n<p>Around 30 minutes into his lecture, Vargas addressed the central, basic question regarding immigration, legal or not: “Why do people move?”</p>\n<p>Vargas delved into issues with U.S. foreign policy, particularly that of imperialism and colonialism, regarding his home nation of the Philippines. He referenced a conservative Tea Party event in North Carolina that he attended, where he said his response to a condescending question about Filipinos presence in the U.S. was, “Sir, <i>we are here</i> because <i>you were there</i>.”</p>\n<p>Vargas also called attention to the different ways that mass movements of people are framed.</p>\n<p>“Why is it that when white people move it’s called courageous, necessary … Manifest Destiny [and] White Man’s Burden. Yet when people of color move, what’s the question? Is it legal? Is it a crime? Will they assimilate? When will it stop?”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of his talk, Vargas revisited his recent book and the process behind it, detailing how the separation of the book into the themes of lying, passing and hiding came about.</p>\n<p>“My editor did something that was really horrific. She said, ‘I want you to go home for the holidays and I want you to list the Top 20 most painful experiences of your life,’” Vargas said.</p>\n<p>“I listed 22. When I broke them out everything had to do with either lying, passing and hiding.”</p>\n<p>For Vargas, filling out an employment form for the San Francisco Chronicle was an especially poignant moment. At the time, Vargas was not a lawful permanent resident nor did he agree with the categorization of himself as an “alien.”</p>\n<p>Marking himself as a citizen would constitute perjury, as a sentence on the application reminded him. Despite this, he checked himself off as a citizen.</p>\n<p>“There was nothing else to check so I checked citizen, and whenever I checked it I actually convinced myself I was gonna go earn [citizenship].</p>\n<p>Vargas was told later by a lawyer this past offense — a false claim to citizenship — may be the reason he never becomes a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p>Even worse, he said he was ‘hiding’ from his mother, not having seen her in 25 years. She herself has been waiting for 16 years to come in the legal way from the Philippines.</p>\n<p>Vargas closed the speech by asking the audience to raise their hands if they were U.S. citizens.

CSD meeting on Tuesday. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The report touched on a variety of topics, focusing mainly on how to remediate I.V.’s current lighting situation, which many residents deem inadequate, according to the report. The report also covered funding, wattage increases and potential problems that could arise from the implementation of new lighting fixtures.</p>\n<p>The report, compiled by the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) Jeike Meijer, I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and Associated Students Lobby Corps proposes improvements to the existing street lighting situation.</p>\n<p>The lighting augmentation would include street light wattages from 54W L.E.D. to 130W L.E.D. along the 6600 and 6700 blocks of Pasado Road and Sueno Road, the 6500 and 6600 blocks of Picasso Road and the 6500 block of Cordoba Road, Segovia Road, El Greco Road and Cervantes Road.</p>\n<p>This change in wattage would match that of the existing wattages for Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road as well as parts of Abrego Road and Trigo Road, which already have 130W L.E.D. bulbs installed.</p>\n<p>Altogether, the report suggests increasing the wattage of 73 L.E.D. street lights in I.V. The report calculated the L.E.D. updates to cost roughly $21,900, or $300 per each L.E.D.</p>\n<p>Aside from detailing fixed costs, the report also noted that ongoing costs would be “funded though CSA 31’s (County Service Area 31) benefit and property tax revenue,” which has a  surplus of approximately $7,500, according to the report.</p>\n<p>There are also recommendations to replace the remaining 38 High Pressure Sodium Vapour (HPSV) street lights with L.E.D.s, due to their lack of efficiency and shorter lifespans, excluding HPSV lights on El Embarcadero and Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>The report proposed the installation of 10 new street lights along Abrego Road, Pasado Road and Sueno Road. These street lights would be placed in areas that currently contain gaps between existing fixtures, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The construction of these new street lights would cost an estimated $90,000, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The report acknowledged concerns regarding the increase in the wattage of existing street lights. Installing new lights could potentially erode I.V.’s “natural serenity” and increase light pollution, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The EVPLA Office made an attempt to alleviate these concerns by citing the energy-efficiency of L.E.D. bulbs and their superior light distribution compared to fluorescent bulbs. L.E.D. lights contain no toxic elements such as mercury, which is commonly found in fluorescent lights, according to the report.</p>\n<p>“Mercury mostly poses a threat to the environment, specifically when fluorescent lights end up in landfill waste,” the report stated.</p>\n<p>While street lighting has been a talking point for Associated Students (A.S.) and I.V. officials for years, I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said there is still a lot of work to be done. Brandt said he hopes that I.V. residents continue to support this proposal and hopes to secure the funds and resources necessary from CSA 31 to keep the project moving forward.</p>\n<p>“There is strong support for a brighter IV and to the hundreds [of] IV residents that have made their voices heard. We will need the community’s continued input in order to make more lighting a reality,” he said in a Facebook post.</p>\n<p>Although this is the most recent attempt to call attention to street lighting deficiencies in I.V., past efforts from community members have also attempted to address this issue, going back as far as 1972, according to Brandt’s Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=248625322477836\">post</a>.</p>\n<p>Students, leaders and law enforcement officials also voiced their concerns in support of upgraded lighting fixtures in testimonials from the report.</p>\n<p>Many people’s concerns about lighting deficiencies are rooted in concerns about safety in I.V., which some say would be increased with greater lighting in the area.</p>\n<p>“Often when I feel the least safe is when I am walking back to my apartment through I.V. at night, and I think adding more lighting would make me, and others, feel safer,” Sarah Allen-Sutter, fourth-year psychology major, wrote in her testimonial in the report.</p>\n<p>For now, some students, including Emily Montalvo-Telford, president of Students Against Sexual Assault, said they have to resort to other means for ensuring safety when walking through dimly lit I.V. streets at night.</p>\n<p>“I feel unsafe. I am forced to walk quickly and I have spent many walks on the phone with friends in order to experience even a small amount of security,” Montavlo-Telford wrote in the report.</p>\n<p>Lt. Juan Camarena of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office wrote in the report that he agreed that increased lighting would be a viable way to mitigate crime and increase safety.</p>\n<p>“Improved lighting means that offenders are more likely to be seen by someone who might intervene, call law enforcement, or recognize the offender,” Camarena wrote.</p>\n<p>The report also included a survey conducted by the EVPLA office which asked I.V. residents if money designated for improving I.V. should be spent expanding either sidewalks or lighting. Lighting was overwhelmingly favored, garnering 90.9 percent of the 187 responses.</p>\n<p>The report proposed several ways to gauge feedback from the community about lighting issues and then suggested specific improvements for lighting expansion and renovation.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD, in collaboration with A.S., would co-host a Lighting Expansion Forum, which would give residents the opportunity to review the proposal and provide input.</p>\n<p>Canvassing would also be carried out door-to-door, with volunteers giving information to residents about proposed changes and the lighting expansion forum for the public.</p>\n<p>A full version of the report can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Preliminary-Lighting-Expansion-Plan.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Preliminary-Lighting-Expansion-Plan.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object><br>\n<a class=\"pdflink\" style=\"display: none;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Preliminary-Lighting-Expansion-Plan.pdf\">Download Document</a></p>\n<p><em>Updated [2:42 p.m.] </em></p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams and Sean Crommelin can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 14, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Then once it passed a certain size, other people were like, ‘Oh, this is for everyone,’ and they felt more welcome to post,” Truong said.</p>\n<p>From the start, the page grew quickly.</p>\n<p>“It didn’t take long at all; we advertised it immediately on the other memes page, so everyone just came over,” Vu said.</p>\n<p>“It was like a snowball effect; even people from other schools wanted to join,” Ocampo added.</p>\n<p>The admins found that certain periods of the quarter, like midterm season, saw peaks in activity   because a lot of people were going through the same hardships that come with being a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>“More people are likely to complain about the same thing, and because of that people are able to relate to [Overheard at UCSB] more, which contributes to the popularity,” Chen said.</p>\n<p>Overheard at UCSB quickly adopted a unique flavor in line with the campus itself and the community of I.V.</p>\n<p>“Each Overheard page has its own culture that kind of, like, reflects the culture of the college … at UCSB it’s kind of like a bit [of a] party school. You hear a lot of really inappropriate pieces of conversation,” Chen said.</p>\n<p>While Overheard at UCSB has grown organically with its community, the admins have had to exercise judgment in moderating content from certain users who have tried to hijack the page to sell products or simply commandeer the group.</p>\n<p>“There are rules in place for a reason. Sometimes people try to make it their own page … it’s not ‘Overheard from Someone Else,’ it’s Overheard at UCSB, and we want it to be about the campus, not a specific person,” Ocampo said.</p>\n<p>“There was a person on Overheard who posted multiple times a day, so we checked him out, and he doesn’t even go here. He, like, looked up facts to make the posts more relatable, and then he tried to sell them on apparel. We’ve blocked him twice,” Vu said.</p>\n<p>Still, the admins believe that the page has flowered into a thriving community.</p>\n<p>“I think, as long as people are willing to share their experiences, Overheard at UCSB has a place,” Chen said.</p>\n<p><em>Sean Crommelin is a copy editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 14, 2019 of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

We let everybody write their message, so that way once it’s delivered it’s already handwritten.”</p>\n<p>The idea to sell Valentine’s day grams started as a group project for Congdon’s Principles of Marketing class, TMP 124, where he and his group members had to construct a pop-up shop.</p>\n<p>After learning the project was due in February, Congdon’s group quickly realized that selling sex toys as part of a Valentine’s day pop-up could actually work, after previously tossing the idea around as a joke.</p>\n<p>“A friend in my group joked about it because her boyfriend’s dad actually owns a sex shop company so we could get wholesale prices,” Congdon said. “It was due in February, and we were like, what’s around February? Valentine’s day!” Congdon said.</p>\n<p>Congdon said the group project had only one rule: The shop couldn’t sell anything illegal.</p>\n<p>Shortly after realizing their idea could become a reality, Congdon, along with group members Clarissa Requiestas, Francesca Towers, Tommy Cen and Raymond Quan, began to map out the logistics of their project.</p>\n<p>Congdon found that the best approach for attracting customers would be to advertise on sites such as Facebook, where he could reach a large audience but also spare interested students the shame of walking into a brick-and-mortar sex shop.</p>\n<p>“We thought people might buy it for themselves. This is the perfect front to do it. It kinda, like, demystifies it. Like, ‘Oh, it’s a joke for a friend.’ If they wanted, they can gift themselves and not tell anybody.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of their buyers’ motivations, Congdon considered the Valentine’s Day grams a success, noting that his group sold over 80 grams before closing up shop.</p>\n<p>The grams are no longer being sold, as the due date for the project fell before Valentine’s Day.</p>\n<p>However, as part of the pop-up shop, Congdon and his group pledged to donate 5 percent of their proceeds to the Planned Parenthood California Central Coast.</p>\n<p>”It’s another way you can feel good about about buying a product for a good cause. We’re trying to demystify and capitalize on the [sex toy] market, trying to add to it to make it [as] least stigmatized as possible.”</p>\n<p>After packaging the sex toys and preparing all the grams for delivery on Sunday, Congdon and his group are ready to please the masses with their Valentine’s Day gifts. The group ran into minor roadblocks, such as realizing some of their pre-ordered sex toys were actually out of stock, but Congdon believes the pop-up was a solid attempt, especially for a first run.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of shifting of gears, but it was the first and only time we did it … It would be cool to do it again,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or maxabrams@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 14, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The most recent demands aim to address “structural hindrances on the development of Black UCSB students,” according to the list of demands authored by the BSU Demands Team.</p>\n<p>“Black students must continually fight to have their humanity recognized and appreciated, which takes time away from students’ abilities to study, learn and become wholly involved as campus community members,” the team wrote in the demands list.</p>\n<p>The demands team argued that the university’s lack of effort to improve the conditions of black students on campus has required that BSU members and the black student community consistently advocate for black students, according to the demands list. To alleviate this, BSU demands institutional changes they said would provide a reliable source of advocacy for black students on campus.</p>\n<p>“The University has continually been unable to fulfill Black students’ demands without the intervention of Black students on campus who address this inability,” the demands team wrote.</p>\n<p>“The University’s reliance on Black student intervention in what should be structured efforts to support Black students is unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>The Feb. 8 demands include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creation of an Office of Black Student Development “to support the Black experience at UCSB.” The office would include eight paid positions and would provide “resources, advocate for and help create a positive learning environment” for black students in addition to building a “sense of belonging” to bolster the academic success of black students.</li>\n<li>The implementation of a Director of Black Student Development, who would advocate for black students on campus and keep the university “accountable to Black students and Black student development.”</li>\n<li>The implementation of two academic support counselors dedicated to addressing the academic achievement needs of black students.</li>\n<li>The implementation of a recruitment and retention specialist to “ensure that the University is … recruiting more Black students in order to increase our Black student population” and to focus on Black student retention. The specialist would also focus on “creating a livable environment for Black people.”</li>\n<li>The implementation of a coordinator of black student life, who would specialize in the social and extracurricular activities and opportunities of black students.</li>\n<li>The implementation of two advocacy counselors tasked with identifying the current challenges that black students face at UCSB and working to resolve those issues and help black students achieve their goals.</li>\n<li>The creation of a building on campus, which would be named the “Malcolm X Center for Black Student Development.”  It would be solely dedicated to black students and would be a commemoration to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/50-years-ago-12-students-and-the-takeover-that-changed-everything/\">North Hall Takeover of 1968</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BSU estimates the total cost of the demands to be about $900,000 and requires that this money be provided permanently by the chancellor’s office, as opposed to the Division of Student Affairs, and be allocated by February of 2021.</p>\n<p>BSU also demands that the construction of the Malcolm X Center for Black Student Development begin within the same two-year period. This demand for a building for black students on campus was part of the 1968 demands set forth by BSU members during the North Hall Takeover.</p>\n<p>“We believe that it is time that the University fulfill the commitments that it has claimed to have made to Black students throughout the course of the last 50 years. We want the entire campus community to know and hear clearly our struggle. We refuse to wait any longer,” the demands team wrote.</p>\n<p>BSU met with Chancellor Henry T. Yang and other top administrators on Friday to present and discuss BSU’s demands.</p>\n<p>Yang said he is willing to work with students in creating Office of Black Student Development in a statement he sent to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>“I am supportive of the vision for an Office of Black Student Development, and have been working with students, faculty, and administrative colleagues to ensure that progress is made toward the first steps of planning for the establishment of such a significant resource,” Yang wrote in the statement.</p>\n<p>The demands and information about the meeting were emailed to <i>Nexus </i>on Feb. 9. In that email, BSU expressed “frustrations” about an incident that had happened during the meeting.</p>\n<p>According to the email, Maria Herrera-Sobek, associate vice chancellor of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion, made “disturbing and insulting” comments which “belittle[d] the struggle of Black UCSB students and Black people by minimizing the Black identity as a whole.”</p>\n<p>While discussing BSU’s demands, Herrera-Sobek reportedly expressed her discontent with a previous black administrator, who she felt centered efforts on the black student community and lacked attention toward the Chicanx and Latinx student community, the email stated.</p>\n<p>Herrera-Sobek also reportedly said during the meeting that she would have hoped the administrator spent more time focused on the Hispanic student community, adding that, “[W]e are all African,” according to the email.</p>\n<p>“Black students across the board continue to be undervalued and underserved at an institutional level within university systems,” BSU wrote in the email.</p>\n<p>“Our meeting [on Friday] proved how ignorant our own administration is to the plights of Black students.”</p>\n<p>Herrera-Sobek said she apologized to the BSU members for the effects that her comments had in the meeting.</p>\n<p>“I have communicated to the students that I deeply regret the remarks that caused them discomfort and made them feel marginalized,” Herrera-Sobek wrote in an email sent to the <i>Nexus</i> on Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>“I hope to have the opportunity for further dialogue with the students and to continue to find ways for my office and the university to support their needs and to address their pressing concerns.”</p>\n<p>BSU said Herrera-Sobek’s behavior during the meeting was an “iteration of anti-Blackness” on behalf of the university, and something they said is familiar to the experiences of black students at UCSB and other schools such as <a href=\"https://www.independent.com/news/2019/jan/25/protests-against-racism-santa-barbara-city-college/\">Santa Barbara City College</a> and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-cal-poly-racism-20180425-story.html\">California Polytechnic State University</a>.</p>\n<p>“It was troublesome for us to hear an administrator whose position is explicitly and solely dedicated to diversity and equity on campus use such apparent anti-Black rhetoric,” BSU wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>A copy of the demands in full can be read below: <object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Demands-Office-of-BSD-Statement-pdf.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Demands-Office-of-BSD-Statement-pdf.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p><em>Updated [2:30 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or sofiamejias@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 14, 2019 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

It passed unanimously during the meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“There is a lack of concept continuity among incoming AS Presidents which can perpetuate a culture of unfinished projects that may waste AS resources,” the bill states, arguing that Associated Students (A.S.) Presidents can be “limited” in their abilities to finish projects due to their one-year terms.</p>\n<p>The creation of the position was one of Kopel’s main projects that she hoped to accomplish during her term as A.S. President.</p>\n<p>“Particularly with this office, and especially my projects, [these] are definitely more long-term projects,” Kopel said in an interview with the <i>Nexus </i>earlier last week.</p>\n<p>“Having that position is really crucial in making sure that there’s no transition divide that would inhibit the projects from being carried through.”</p>\n<p>The position must be filled by someone who will be at UC Santa Barbara for the entirety of the 2019-2020 school year and is also familiar with the type of projects that the Office of the President takes on.</p>\n<p>The filling of the position is up to Kopel’s discretion, without prior approval from the Senate, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>The position’s duties entail staying up to date on all of the president’s short-term and long term projects, meeting with the president once a week, meeting with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez once a quarter, attending at least two Senate meetings per quarter, being in attendance and taking notes at all project-related meetings with the president, holding two office hours per week and serving at least four quarters over a span of two academic years.</p>\n<p>Kopel said that ideally she would transition one of her fellows into fulfilling that position.</p>\n<p>“Since all of my fellows are first-years, they will definitely be here next year and next Fall Quarter to transition or help the new president in any way that they can.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> held at the beginning of her term, Kopel said that being in A.S. for so long – first as a caseworker with the Office of the Student Advocate and then as a Letters and Science Senator for the 68th Senate – prompted her to create the position.</p>\n<p>“There’s so many fantastic ideas that students in these leadership positions [come up with] but cannot accomplish in a year,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>“That’s shameful that you have something that would be so beneficial for this community, the campus community, and it’s literally just not accomplished because there’s bureaucratic issues.”</p>\n<p>She admitted that the position may not fix the projects problem entirely, but believes that “attempting it would be a great start.”</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object><br>\n<a class=\"pdflink\" style=\"display: none;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\">Download Document</a></p>\n<p><em>Updated [2:20 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 14, 2019 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

She hopes to use her experience to host events like these and make students aware of the resources available to them on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caughman echoed a similar goal for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We knew we wanted to do something to reduce food waste,” Caughman said. “Through our research, we found that a leading cause of food waste stems from the food in circulation not being distributed efficiently, so we decided to survey UCSB students to see how much they knew about the A.S. Food Bank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The survey results showed that many people were unaware of the A.S. Food Bank (A.S. FB)  or found it to be inaccessible to them. This gave the team the idea to bring the A.S. Food Bank to the people, in one of the most heavily trafficked parts of campus during one of the busiest times of the day, according to Caughman.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was deemed a success by the team, with 53 students receiving free groceries from the pop-up event in the one hour they were open. Groceries included items such as cereal, peanut butter, pears and noodles.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86147\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86147\" data-attachment-id=\"86147\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-12/students-provide-free-groceries-at-food-bank-pop-up-event/srb-pop-up-food-bank_cameron-hsieh_online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRB-Pop-Up-Food-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1713&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1713\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SRB &amp; Pop Up Food Bank_Cameron Hsieh_ONLINE-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRB-Pop-Up-Food-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=250%2C214&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRB-Pop-Up-Food-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=888%2C761&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86147\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRB-Pop-Up-Food-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=888%2C761\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"761\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRB-Pop-Up-Food-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRB-Pop-Up-Food-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=250%2C214&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRB-Pop-Up-Food-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C658&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRB-Pop-Up-Food-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C877&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRB-Pop-Up-Food-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86147\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a line before we even opened, and we had two of our sign-in pages, front and back, completely filled,” said Caughman, a fourth-year economics and communication double major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a great mix of A.S.

The next events are arranged to take place on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feb. 26 and March 12</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caughman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish more students knew about the A.S. Food Bank in general,” Caughman said. “I also wish students understood that visiting the Food Bank, especially for things like fresh produce, can have a profound effect on mitigating food waste. The produce may not always be as aesthetically pleasing as what you see at the grocery store, but I can assure you that it tastes just as good.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its formation in 2011, the A.S. Food Bank has grown to serve over 2,000 students per week, according to the organization’s website. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who earn less than </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$14,484 per year, not including loans, financial aid or parental income, are eligible to receive free groceries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the school year, students can visit the A.S.
