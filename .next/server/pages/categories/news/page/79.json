Over 20 students were waitlisted, with no facility space to add another lab.</p>\n<p>Rachel Alvelais, a third-year chemistry major, had extensive concerns regarding whether she would be able to graduate on time.</p>\n<p>“For most of us juniors, at this point in time we start to think about graduate school applications, which are due at the middle or end of Fall Quarter,” Alvelais said. “If we have to stay an extra Fall Quarter, then that means that we can’t apply to graduate school next year and we would have to find something to do … for a whole 13 months while we already would have been in graduate school.”</p>\n<p>Taking a summer class, an option that has been offered by several departments, is a choice that does not appeal to students like Alvelais, who did not initially plan to take summer courses and have other internship or research obligations.</p>\n<p>Alvelais, however, said she feels that if she was not able to get into the lab course needed to graduate, she would have no choice but to take summer classes, despite the financial burden.</p>\n<p>The department added more students to each existing lab class, and Alvelais was able to take the class she needed to graduate and do research over the summer; however, her experience is indicative of a more widespread problem.</p>\n<p>Steven Buratto, chair of the Chemistry Department, said he is concerned about a lack of resources for the increasing number of enrolled students.</p>\n<p>“The University of California is great. You get a great education for a reasonable price, comparatively speaking,” Buratto said. “But we don‘t want to get so overcrowded that we can’t accommodate the students that we have.”</p>\n<p>The Chemistry and Biology Departments face issues with physical lab space, a lack of graduate students to work as teaching assistants and a lack of faculty.</p>\n<p>“We’ve reached our capacity, and so at some point throwing money at it doesn’t work,” said Stephen Poole, chair of the Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB) Department. “You need faculty to teach these students, you need graduate students to work as TAs, so money could help there; we could expand our graduate program.”</p>\n<p>These restrictions are not felt only within S.T.E.M. fields.</p>\n<p>Alison Brysk, the global studies department chair, said the department also faces similar space restrictions: Designated class sizes are quickly surpassing the physical capacity of lecture halls.</p>\n<p>Such restrictions make certain classes more competitive in terms of enrollment, which limits the ability of non-global studies majors to enroll in popular global studies courses.</p>\n<p>Though other UCs have begun offering classes during the evening, there are several challenges to doing this at UCSB. Poole said this is not a viable solution due to the staff needed to prepare labs and the fact that certain lecture halls, like Campbell Hall, are used for other purposes at night.</p>\n<p>Many departments also lack qualified TAs, which limits the departments’ abilities to provide further assistance for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>“Graduate students are critical to both the teaching and research missions of our university,” Napolitano said in a statement. “They serve key roles in supporting the academic inquiry and discovery of our faculty, as well as the teaching load for our undergraduates.”</p>\n<p>UCSB, however, has not increased the number of graduate students sufficiently; according to campus profiles authored by the university’s Office of Budget and Planning, this year there were 73 less new graduate students than there were for the 2015-16 year.</p>\n<p>Larger class sizes are difficult for students to get into and in many cases can negatively affect students’ learning experiences.</p>\n<p>Jerry Chung, the education coordinator for the actuarial science department, said large class sizes hinder students’ ability to interact with each other and increase their own knowledge.</p>\n<p>“An unintended consequence of huge classes is that students in the actuarial science major find it increasingly difficult to network and learn from one another,” Chung said.</p>\n<p>To combat this issue, students in the department have created UCSB’s Actuarial Association, which hosts educational and social events to network with each other.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the effects of increased enrollment extend past the classroom.</p>\n<p>This March, Wyatt Licht, a fourth-year communication major, started a petition to stop bike impounding across campus. The petition alleged that there were not enough bike racks on campus for all students, a sentiment that 481 petition-signers agreed with.</p>\n<p>Student services such as Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) have also been affected.</p>\n<p>“It certainly affects the demand for our services; there’s more students on campus, which means there’s more students wanting or needing mental health services,” said C.A.P.S director Jeanne Stanford.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have enough space,” Stanford added. “So if we had more space then we would be able to hire more psychologists, and if we had more psychologists then we would be able to accommodate more students.”</p>\n<p>Between 10 to 15 percent of students use C.A.P.S., and with outreach programs, Stanford estimates that they are able to reach around 25 percent of the student population.</p>\n<p>She said that an increase in population density in a small space increases “irritability, frustration [and] anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Stanford also said increased enrollment extends past C.A.P.S. and “affects everything,” including longer wait times at the Office of Financial Aid and the Registrar.</p>\n<p>The increasing numbers also concern undergraduate housing. While the San Joaquin Residence Hall currently under construction will help mitigate the housing strain, a significant increase in freshmen could pose problems.</p>\n<p>“If there was a dramatic increase, then we would have to strategize about how to accommodate them,” said Mario Muñoz, associate director of Resident Placement &amp; Assignment Services. “We would probably have to look at how we distribute the spaces that we have.”</p>\n<p>Chuck Haines, acting assistant chancellor of the Office of Budget and Planning, said that while we currently have enough space for students, more housing will have to be built in the future.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang told the Nexus in an interview Tuesday that the university wants to ensure that dorm rooms are no more than triples, and he said philanthropic support of campus housing is an option for the future.</p>\n<p>“Any philanthropic support of housing would lower the cost to students,” Haines said.</p>\n<p>Next year, there will be a small decrease in the number of freshmen admitted, but total undergraduate enrollment will still increase slightly due to an increased emphasis on admitting transfer students.</p>\n<p>According to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, UCSB has been steadily increasing enrollment according to the Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), which has a cap on enrollment at 25,000 students.</p>\n<p>State pressures to increase student enrollment, however, have forced UCSB to grow at a rate much higher than the LRDP suggests.</p>\n<p>“The state has not been very cooperative,” Marshall said. “The state has not been giving us adequate resources.”</p>\n<p>As enrollment increases, so do the costs, including C.A.P.S., faculty and other services.</p>\n<p>“We need a long-term plan,” said Yang. “I and the deans and the budget planning team are addressing this problem.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Community Services District (CSD) board president who led the march, said he saw the parade as a glimpse into the future of what Deltopia could be.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that everyone appreciated, and it was all fun, all positive,” he said. “That got me thinking, ‘Hey, if there’s more planned programming, I think that’s really the first step toward a ‘sanctioned Deltopia.’”</p>\n<p>Bertrand and other I.V. stakeholders have, for the past few years, proposed the idea of making Deltopia a sanctioned event. Rather than having the informal Spring Break celebration, they hope that someday Deltopia could be a planned festival of sorts — one with alcohol vending, booked performances or perhaps more Mardi Gras marches.</p>\n<p>“I think that it will be really important for us moving forward instead of just trying to see Deltopia as a problem we can put a Band-Aid on from a law enforcement perspective,” said Spencer Brandt, who also serves as a director on the CSD board.</p>\n<p>UCPD sent in approximately 70 officers into I.V. this weekend, the lowest in recent years, considering that police have had as many as 300 officers in town during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“We need to be doing what we can to bring it out into the open and regulate it,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he envisions a Deltopia where organizers are “distributing wristbands, having music in the parks [and] selling alcohol out in an open place where it is regulated and we know who is able to purchase it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76839\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76839\" data-attachment-id=\"76839\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-11/in-photos-deltopia-weekend-2017/deltopia-by-mclane/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopia by McLane\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-76839 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76839\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some on the I.V.

Hundreds of partygoers would take inflatable rafts and other floatable devices into the water, hence the name.</p>\n<p>Police estimated as many as 1,000 attendees in the early years of Floatopia.</p>\n<p>Following complaints that the partying was having adverse effects on the environment, Santa Barbara County officials opted to close the beaches in 2010, placing barricades at the beach access points along Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>In response to the closure of Floatopia, Isla Vistans planned demonstrations on Del Playa Drive that they called Deltopia in 2010.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76841\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76841\" data-attachment-id=\"76841\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-11/in-photos-deltopia-weekend-2017/deltopia-crowd-mclane/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopia crowd McLane\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-76841 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I.V. residents coined the name “Floatopia,” the precursor to Deltopia, in 2003 after they took to the beaches and floated on inflatable rafts in the water.

Officers arrested over 100 residents, according to police estimates.</p>\n<p>The riots led to broad discussion of the possibility of instituting a sanctioned Deltopia. Abboud said it was a primary issue in the last quarter of his A.S. presidency.</p>\n<p>“This was actually a very, very widely popular, talked-about issue in the few weeks following the riots,” he said. “[We thought,] let’s sanction it and make it work, you know?

id=\"caption-attachment-76914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The building, located between Broida Hall and the UCSB Library, has been plagued by dry rot, damage from insects and steel beam corrosion. <em>Jose Arturo Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After an inspection of the building by Van Sande Structural Consultants, campus building official Ed Schmittgen notified the university on Jan. 9 that the building was no longer safe due to dry rot, insect damage, steel beam corrosion and an inadequate amount of ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor.</p>\n<p>Schmittgen said there was also not enough seismic bracing within the building.</p>\n<p>Seismic bracing “prevents a building from moving laterally during a seismic event,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p>Such problems could weaken the building’s structure and lead to earthquake vulnerability, he said. The university informed students that they needed to evacuate the building within 45 days.</p>\n<p>The building is over 40 years old and serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began during the week of Feb. 13 and concluded over Spring Break, the university has added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building. These structures make the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes.</p>\n<p>“We essentially have more assurance now that the building is structurally stable than prior to this effort,” Schmittgen said.</p>\n<p>The addition of the concrete pillars has decreased the seismic risk of the building and is one of the steps stabilizing the building. The building will need further adjustments to fix a rotting part of the floor and the foundation of the building, which has suffered water damage.</p>\n<p>The remaining reparations will take place over the summer so students can continue to use El Centro throughout Spring Quarter. Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said the administration is working with a group of students from El Centro to plan out the details of the project.</p>\n<p>“The seismic stabilization had to happen right away in order to keep the building in use this year, but the other part of the renovation, we’re outlining the scope of the project right now,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>According to Klawunn, pressure from the student groups that use El Centro prompted the administration to reconsider its options for the building’s future. Associated Students Senate passed a bill on Jan. 18 urging the university to preserve the historical building.</p>\n<p>“What really made the difference was students saying, ‘We don’t want the building out of commission,’” Klawunn said. “So then Design and Construction went back to see if there is any solution to this that could keep the building in operation.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn said the new solution was not driven by finances or the cost of a demolition project but rather by “what makes the most sense.” She said the plan allows students to access the building for the duration of the quarter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

bus system is adding 14 new electric shuttles and introducing new farebox and smartphone technology to modernize its system as well as rebranding its 30-year-old logo.</p>\n<p>The Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) will accompany the technology with a new student access system in the next year, along with making changes to bus schedules beginning Aug. 21.</p>\n<p>According to reports by the American Public Transportation Association, UC Santa Barbara student ridership has increased by 31 percent from 2011 to 2016 — a contrast to the dropping rates both nationwide and in California.</p>\n<p>Nationwide ridership is decreasing, said Hillary Blackerby, MTD marketing and community relations manager, due in part to a sustained period of low gas prices and the change in landscape for transportation.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said they cannot point out a specific reason for declining ridership, but they are “definitely interested in competing for people’s ridership.”</p>\n<p>According to the MTD 2016-2021 Strategic Plan, “The vision of MTD is that public transit within the District should be so available and attractive that use of an automobile is a choice, not a necessity.”</p>\n<p>Despite national and statewide ridership trends, 14 new electric shuttles are being custom-made in Lancaster, CA, and after thorough training and testing, they will slowly be introduced to the district this summer.</p>\n<p>The new shuttles “show [their] commitment to the environment,” Blackerby said, and she hopes their schedule adjustments will improve bus arrival timing.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said the proposed schedule adjustments hope to combat traffic congestion, primarily near the Storke and Hollister intersection, which is caused by the new housing developments that have changed the traffic flow.</p>\n<p>MTD is also testing student ACCESS cards to see if they will be compatible with new fareboxes that will be installed later this year.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said the new boxes will work based off of a list of active student ID numbers that determine rider eligibility when a card is swiped. The boxes will replace the bus sticker system for UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students. MTD officials are still negotiating the details with the university, she said.</p>\n<p>A new smartphone app will also launch later this year to give real-time GPS tracking of buses en route, Blackerby said. The service will also be available via text for non-smartphone users.</p>\n<p>“As someone who has waited hours in line” at the A.S. Ticket Office to get a bus sticker, third-year history of public policy major and Off-Campus Senator Batsheva Stoll said she is looking forward to the new farebox system.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she believes this change will best serve students that live in the Santa Catalina dormitories because “They are the ones that use the bus the most to get to school.”</p>\n<p>Lines 12x and 24x, which run from UCSB to downtown Santa Barbara, will decrease in frequency, running every 35 minutes instead of the current 30 minutes. A few isolated trips will be removed throughout the day so the buses’ arrival times are more consistent.</p>\n<p>Lines 6, 11, 20, 21x, 23 and 25 will be slightly adjusted in timing but not reduced in frequency. A minor reroute will be made for Line 23 after 7 p.m. to accommodate the El Encanto Heights neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The UCSB and SBCC student line, 15x, will see a frequency increase of up to six minutes. An additional six trips in both directions will be added during “key parts of the day,” said Transit Planner Mark Clyde.</p>\n<p>Lines 1 and 2 will revert morning weekday commute hour services from 10-minute to 15-minute frequencies due to the loss of a grant source.</p>\n<p>The Nexus previously reported that a potential route from Goleta to Carpinteria during the morning and evening commute hours would become available through Caltrans funding. Blackerby told the <em>Nexus</em>, however, that Caltrans decided to not fund the project.</p>\n<p>“Their schedule is not tracking correctly with what is happening in reality, and to a lot of people [the changes] look like a cut at first, but I think they did a good job at clarifying,” said Director of the Isla Vista Community Services District Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>“It’s always better to have a schedule that is in line with reality so that folks don’t end up waiting at a bus stop,” said Brandt.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/","id":3822,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[3821,3820,3819],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Father of 2014 I.V.

One of the students died after being rushed to the hospital.</p>\n<p>While this incident is not considered a mass shooting, which is defined as a shooting where four or more people are killed by a firearm, Martinez said he believes it is similar to many mass shootings in the country because it was calculated and included the shooter committing suicide.</p>\n<p>In response to the events, Martinez spoke in advocacy of a gun control bill currently passing through the California state legislature, Assembly Bill 424 (AB 424).</p>\n<p>AB 424 aims to keep school district superintendents or other equivalent school authorities from providing permission to possess a firearm in a school zone.</p>\n<p>The bill passed through committee for a second time on April 5 and must now go through a third reading before being sent off to the state senate.</p>\n<p>“The current California law states that guns are prohibited K through 12, but there is an exception if schools approve it,” Martinez said. “AB 424 takes away the exception and says there shouldn’t be any guns on school property.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the three biggest problems with having guns in schools are the increase in risks of accidental shootings, complications with law enforcement in emergency situations and elevating conflict.</p>\n<p>“The situation is when you have a good guy with a gun and a bad guy with a gun, the police don’t know which is the shooter and complicate the situation further,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>Martinez said “there isn’t one solution” to gun violence, but he believes AB 424 is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>“If you have a solution to gun violence, will it work 100 percent of the time? No.</p>\n<p>But the same goes for seatbelts. Just because they don’t work all the time doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use them,” Martinez said. “Would it ever work 100 percent of the time? No. But it’s absurd that we’re in this situation, and we need to do better.”</p>\n<p>Martinez stressed the importance of gun violence reform and compared the United States’s policy to that of gun laws in other countries, where there is significantly less gun violence.</p>\n<p>“It needs to stop,” stated Martinez. “An American woman is 16 times more likely to be shot with a gun than in another country. We should not have to live like this. Other countries have guns, and they don’t have this problem.”</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t have to be like this,” Martinez added. “And more guns are not the solution to gun violence.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/","id":4418,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[4417,4416,4415],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Filmmakers Talk Rwandan Rape in Corwin","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Uncondemned.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Uncondemned.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Approximately 280 people were in attendance at Corwin Pavilion for the Monday evening screening and panel with the film’s producers and protagonists organized by the Associated Students (A.S.)

There were incidents that took place, but overall it was a safe event,” Bertrand said. “I think it marks a continual culture change in Isla Vista for a safer Deltopia weekend.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said he noticed much more community involvement in trying to keep Deltopia safe, as multiple organizations participated in keeping the atmosphere positive.</p>\n<p>“We’re seeing much more community buy-in than we ever have before in the effort to make it a safe event,” he said. “In all of it [there were] people promoting positivity, people looking out for their neighbors, people connecting those in need with resources and just making sure that Deltopia is the safest event that it can be.”</p>\n<p>Jay Freeman, board member of the I.V. CSD, spoke about the community’s feeling toward police, attributing the positive perception this year to the lack of horses. Freeman said the horses can give a negative impression and that fewer police helped improve the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the relationship between safety and entertainment is difficult to manage and he is unsure whether Deltopia has found the appropriate balance yet.</p>\n<p>“Safety is a trade-off, and we need to ask ourselves, ‘What amount of fun do we want to have for what amount of risk?’” Freeman said. “I do not know if Deltopia is at the right balance, but I do know that just trying to shut down parties and shut down events indiscriminately, yes, that will make things safer, but at what point do we simply say no music ever?”</p>\n<p>Police broke up approximately 12 parties because of “safety concerns” and alleged law violations, such as overcrowding, underage drinking and debris being thrown from balconies of residences.</p>\n<p>Hoover said crowds diminished after the noise ordinance was instituted at 6 p.m. and further dispersed after 7 p.m. to attend the university-sponsored concert, The Warm Up. The concert held its third iteration at the Thunderdome on Saturday, with artists Destructo and RL Grime taking the stage.</p>\n<p>University-led initiatives like The Warm Up and the UC Isla Vista (UCIV) program, as well as a county-instated festival ordinance from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., have aimed at minimizing unrest at Deltopia.</p>\n<p>UCIV, an Associated Students (A.S.) Public Safety Commission project, sent approximately 100 volunteers to notify students of the ordinance and other laws that would affect them, as well as hand out condoms, cookies and water, according to the commission’s chair Jenna Pack.</p>\n<p>Pack said she thought this year’s Deltopia was “1000-percent better” than the year before.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot less chaos, a lot less people, a lot less havoc,”  Pack said. “We saw a lot less crime going on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/","id":4423,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4422,4421,4420],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yemeni Nobel Laureate Visits UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25072264654_6e8f208450_b-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25072264654_6e8f208450_b-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tawakkol Karman, the first female Arab and Yemeni Nobel laureate, came from Istanbul to discuss tyranny, terrorism and the Arab Spring.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite the large crowd that filled Campbell Hall on Saturday evening, when Yemeni journalist Tawakkol Karman asked for a moment of silence for the victims of the deadly chemical attacks in Syria, the air was completely still.</p>\n<p>Co-sponsored by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures and the Walter Capps Foundation, Karman, the first female Arab and Yemeni Nobel laureate, came from Istanbul to discuss tyranny, terrorism and the Arab Spring as a part of the World Harmony lecture series. UC Santa Barbara is the first UC campus to host her.</p>\n<p>“Dear brothers and sisters,” she began, a phrase she repeated multiple times. “I am so proud to be here.”</p>\n<p>She expressed her “sadness and anger” at violent events that have occurred in Syria, especially those in her region, such as the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria that she blamed on Assad’s tyrannical regime.</p>\n<p>She focused her lecture on tyranny and the Arab Spring, which she described as a “response to the decay of justice.”</p>\n<p>“Our revolution is not a fleeting whim, but needs that we have had for many years,” she said.</p>\n<p>Karman organized student rallies in Sana’a, the largest city in Yemen and was imprisoned several times in 2011. In Yemen’s opposition movement, she is known as the “Iron Woman” and described going to prison as the “best moment of [her] life.”</p>\n<p>“They were stupid when they took me to the jail, because it made me very strong,” she said.</p>\n<p>Karman’s incarceration led to Yemeni people rioting in the streets, calling for her release and repeating her chants, which engaged students in the revolution.</p>\n<p>She also spoke about both President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama, expressing her disappointment with their relationships with Syria.</p>\n<p>When asked about her views of Obama, she said she “expected a lot from him, as a human,” but found herself disappointed.</p>\n<p>“I blame him on the bloodshed in Syria,” she said. “I believe that he could stop the bloodshed.”</p>\n<p>Despite this, Karman said she respects him and believes he did great things within the U.S.</p>\n<p>Karman went on to criticize President Trump’s travel ban, which she called a violation of international human rights and “values as an American.”</p>\n<p>“Whoever brands Muslims with terror is not only lying and ignorant, he is directly and indirectly helping terrorism,” she said.</p>\n<p>She also spoke about how religion was used against her and other women who tried to demonstrate.</p>\n<p>“Dictators use religion to build walls between nations,” she said. “All of us should be against the bad religious people who translate religion in a bad way.”</p>\n<p>She urged the audience to take responsibility to protect their values, including “peace, love, coexistence and democracy.”</p>\n<p>Karman spoke extensively about terrorism and said despotism and terrorism are two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>According to Karman, the Western “catastrophic failure” in the Iraq War created conditions for the Islamic State (I.S.). She also said she believes Assad created I.S. to stop the peaceful Syrian revolution.</p>\n<p>“Silence has given Assad the permission to keep killing the Syrian people,” she said. “We don’t accept any choice between terrorism and despotism.

Korean defectors this Thursday to talk about human rights violations and their journeys in escaping a dictatorship.</p>\n<p>L.I.N.K. brought the defectors to campus through its partnership with Young

accounting major, the UCSB L.I.N.K. chapter is dedicated to funding escape missions, helping North Korean refugees integrate into the world and creating a community around human rights activism.</p>\n<p>Kim said he was part of the <i>kochebi</i>, a group of orphaned children of the “hostile” or lower class. The children would scavenge and beg for food in the streets after the economic turmoil that resulted from the death of President Kim Il-Sung in 1994.</p>\n<p>According to Kim, the lower class in North Korea is constantly under surveillance. Citizens who associate with any religion, make contact outside of the country or show dissent toward the government are criminalized and discriminated against.</p>\n<p>The second defector was a part of the “core” or elite class due to her father’s position as a battalion commander, but her whole family was placed in the hostile class after her mother’s escape to China.</p>\n<p>After her second escape attempt, she was captured but released after promising the government that she would spy on her neighbors and friends.

The previous tsunami caused minor damage to a Santa Barbara Harbor as a result of strong currents.</p>\n<p>According to an email from Wilson, California is considered “earthquake country” meaning “we could be susceptible to earthquake hazards (shaking, liquefaction, landslides, etc.) no matter where you live in the state.”</p>\n<p>“Since they are related to earthquakes, we really can’t tell when the next one is going to occur … We just have to be prepared the best we can before they do occur,” Wilson said in an email.</p>\n<p>Wilson said the tsunami threat for the county is “not large compared to what we saw in Japan in 2011 or Indonesia in 2004” as the county does not have the type of fault capable of creating an extreme tsunami.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County’s low-lying areas like Carpinteria and Isla Vista would be the most affected in the event of a tsunami. Williams emphasized that citizens should be aware of the possibility of this particular natural disaster.</p>\n<p>“There is a threat. Any place where there’s oceans and earthquakes, there’s also tsunamis. Obviously, the world became more aware of it because of the tragedy in Japan a couple years ago,” he said. “Remember that tsunami also hit northern California, causing a lot of damage to low-lying areas.”</p>\n<p>Maps from the California Geological Survey show that flooding at UC Santa Barbara would be minimal and would mostly affect the lagoon.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the maps for the UCSB and I.V. areas, the flooding is not extensive in these areas because they are elevated on bluffs,” Wilson said in an email.</p>\n<p>“Flooding during extreme tsunami events could occur in Devereux Lagoon, UCSB Lagoon and the areas around the airport to the northeast.  These areas won’t flood during every tsunami … just during the extreme ones which we have yet to experience in modern history,” Wilson said in an email.</p>\n<p>The resolution Williams sponsored lists three levels of notification for residents to be aware of: tsunami watch, tsunami advisory and tsunami warning.</p>\n<p>A watch means the disaster may later impact an area, an advisory means a tsunami’s possibility to create strong currents or dangerous waves is “imminent, expected, or occurring” and a warning means a tsunami with the likelihood of “widespread inundation” is soon to occur or is occurring.</p>\n<p>Wilson suggests that if residents feel a large earthquake, they should “drop, cover and hold on” during the tremor and evacuate to high ground or inland once possible. In the event of a tsunami, residents may have as few as five hours to evacuate the area.</p>\n<p>“For tsunamis from a distant source, Santa Barbara residents will likely get anywhere from 5 to 13 hours of warning through local officials or on TV/radio before a large tsunami arrives,” Wilson said in an email. “But the message is the same: move to high ground or inland out of the zone.”</p>\n<p>The county has partnered with the Aware &amp; Prepare Initiative to set up a website to provide residents with public information in the event of a natural disaster or other emergency called <i>awareandprepare.org</i>.</p>\n<p>County residents can use the website to sign up for emergency alert text messages, emails and landline calls which will notify them when there are tsunamis, fires, floods or extreme weather, or residents can text their zip code to 888777 to be signed up for alerts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Observers correlate this decrease with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President.</p>\n<p>Among more than 250 colleges and universities across the country, more than 40 percent reported at least a 2 percent decrease in international applicants, according to findings released April 5 by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO).</p>\n<p>The UC saw a similar trend in 2004 and 2005 following the U.S.-led multinational invasion of Iraq. In contrast, American students responded to heightened political tensions following President George W. Bush’s declaration of a “war on terror” by showing an increased interest in studying abroad.</p>\n<p>According to Juan Campo, the UCSB Education Abroad Program director, this year’s increase in applicants to EAP programs around the world is related to controversy surrounding the new administration’s policies, mirroring the surge in applicants in the aftermath of 9/11.</p>\n<p>While there are currently no EAP programs in the six countries under Trump’s Middle East travel ban, Jordan is a popular location for students interested in studying in the region because of its central location and reputation as a reasonably stable nation.</p>\n<p>According to Campo, more UCSB students applied to the EAP programs in Jordan than ever before, with an increase from three applicants for the 2016-17 school year to 13 for the 2017-18 school year.</p>\n<p>“Our enrollments are up over last year, and I am not surprised,” Campo said. “[After 9/11] people were saying, ‘Oh, it’s going to go down,’ but no, because it may cause students to want to become more engaged with the world.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what’s happening now … It’s really heartening to see that and looking system-wide they have a higher number of applications at this time than they had last year at this time,” he said.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President has not yet determined if the drop in applicants of 1.2 percent at Berkeley and 2.2 percent at Riverside is linked to the national phenomenon, as official enrollment figures will be released later in April.</p>\n<p>Lisa Przekop, UCSB director of admissions, said it is difficult to determine whether the university’s international applicant numbers will be similarly affected in the coming years. She acknowledged that the current political climate in the U.S. is a legitimate concern for students abroad.</p>\n<p>“It’s important that we continue to communicate honestly with prospective students so we can address their concerns honestly, dispel inaccurate rumors, and show them that UCSB is a friendly community with esteemed faculty and talented students,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Przekop said the close proximity of the application deadline to the presidential election likely influenced students’ decision whether or not to apply to the UC.</p>\n<p>“There was election coverage that didn’t always show the U.S. as being welcoming to international guests,” Przekop said in an email. “Students abroad pay very close attention to what is happening politically in the U.S. and I’m certain that this played at least a small role in UC application numbers from international students.”</p>\n<p>Mahdi Golkaram, an Iranian mechanical engineering Ph.D. student at UCSB, said his peers in Iran have certainly been discouraged from studying in the U.S. since the implementation of the travel ban.</p>\n<p>According to Golkaram, the increasingly challenging process of obtaining a student visa, not the political tensions arising in the early months of the Trump administration, is the major deterrent for students debating whether to study in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day if they need to get the admission letter, clearance, background check, it takes a long time. I have a lot of friends they just gave up and they went to Canada,” Golkaram said.<br>\n“Right now, I have been talking to a lot of friends, and they don’t even think about applying to the United States anymore because they know how hard it will be for them to go through this whole process,” he said.</p>\n<p>Golkaram added that single-entry visas typically administered to international students make travel outside the U.S. nearly impossible, and he hasn’t left the U.S. for three years because he fears he may not secure a visa again.</p>\n<p>“I would rather not leave the United States at all, which means I’m not going to see my country again for a long time,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Golkaram, the inability to travel outside of the U.S. proves especially challenging for graduate students, who are often expected to attend conferences abroad.</p>\n<p>Simran Singh, director of the Office of International Student Services, said while the current political climate is likely a concern for international students, as well as for their parents, the more common barrier is posed by the complications in obtaining a visa.</p>\n<p>Though the recent five percent increase in UC tuition for non-California residents brought the total cost to $41,964, Singh said she believes the tuition hike is not a likely contributing factor to the decrease in international applicants.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the socioeconomic background of the students who are coming here, they really come from wealthy families and I don’t think that’s a deterrent per se,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>While UCSB has yet to see a decrease in international applicants, Singh said, it is important for all departments on campus to make them feel safe and promote a reputation that the UC is equipped with the proper infrastructure to support traveling scholars.</p>\n<p>“We are talked about as a world class research institution and what they really bring is the diversity,” Singh said. “These students bring so much of themselves when they come into our countries and into our institutions. We learn from them as much as they learn from us.”</p>\n<p>Campo said the nationwide decrease in international applicants is very understandable “given the chaos” surrounding the implementation of the travel ban and the university should be taking concrete steps to ensure international students are not “affected adversely” by policies emerging from the Trump White House.</p>\n<p>“The university has to affirm its place, not as a safe zone so much, but as a forum for bringing these issues to the surface and taking a clear stand on how a civil society remains open and tolerant to different points and perspectives to prevent people from being victims of racial violence or xenophobic or religious bias,” Campo said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Anderle, the judge who ruled that the student may return to school, said that the evidence in the case “suggests UCSB never made an effort to contact Jane Doe to corroborate the statements attributed to her.”</p>\n<p>John Doe’s suspension will remain lifted even if the university places charges against the freshman. The stay on the suspension will remain in effect “up to and including any final judgment in that case, after all appeals, if any,” according to Judge Anderle’s ruling.</p>\n<p>The court ruled that UCSB must also assist Doe by giving him full access to all programs and activities at UCSB with no restrictions, returning him to his assigned on-campus dorm room, allowing him to complete all classes, giving him priority enrollment and providing any assistance necessary from any of the university offices.</p>\n<p>Judge Anderle said in his decision that the university took too long to investigate, failing to fulfill both the 60-calendar-day deadline federally required for Title IX investigations and the 60-business-day deadline agreed upon by the university.</p>\n<p>“The Court of Appeal found that the University’s inaction over such a lengthy period of time, leaving Petitioner in limbo, appears unreasonable and arbitrary,” Judge Anderle said in the court ruling.</p>\n<p>Judge Anderle ruled that the university had caused “irreparable harm” to the student by failing to conduct the investigation in a timely manner, leaving him suspended indefinitely.</p>\n<p>“This Court concludes that the University is intentionally doing indirectly what it is unwilling to do directly. The University has made a decision to deny John Doe the opportunity to enroll in the any [sic] of the first three quarters of his freshman year,” Anderle said in the court ruling. “But instead of making that decision based upon the facts, the law, and in fairness, it has decided to do it their own way.”</p>\n<p>According to Doe’s lawyer, Robert Ottilie, Doe moved into his on-campus dorm during Spring Break and said the university has been very helpful with the process of assimilating Doe to life in college.</p>\n<p>“They could not have been more helpful. The school has been responsive to the ruling,” Ottilie said.<br>\nUCSB spokeswoman Andrea Estrada said the university “will make every effort to ensure the student’s success” while they complete the adjudication process.</p>\n<p>“We respect the court’s rulings and have complied with the court’s order,” she said in an email.<br>\nOttilie said Doe is very happy with the decision because it now allows him to start his life, beginning with attending his “dream school.”</p>\n<p>Ottilie said he was not surprised by the judge’s ruling to remove Doe’s suspension, as he felt the law was clearly on his side.</p>\n<p>“It really wasn’t very much of a surprise. The law is very clear,” he said.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Doe has won his ruling to return to school, he still faces an ongoing investigation against him on behalf of the university, a lawsuit against that claim in court and several hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawyers’ fees that he must pay.</p>\n<p>According to the ruling, Doe has incurred over $100,000 in attorney’s fees and costs just through his filing in December of 2016. The ruling said he has “undoubtedly incurred substantially more in fees and costs since that time.”</p>\n<p>Ottilie said Doe is unable to pay that amount of money and does not expect him to pay the expenses anytime soon. Ottilie himself has incurred $50,000 of out-of-pocket costs from representing Doe against the university.</p>\n<p>As for what Doe will decide to study now that he has started school this Spring Quarter, Ottilie said he does not know what particular major the first-year will choose while at UCSB. Ottilie said it would not surprise him if Doe went on to study law later on.</p>\n<p>Ottilie also said he will continue to investigate abuses of the particular code in the Regents’ laws that the university has used to keep Doe and students in similar situations from attending school.</p>\n<p>Ottilie said new information has come out that suggests the university withheld information during the judicial process, so he also plans to amend the lawsuit to include four UCSB staff members involved in Doe’s 200-day suspension.</p>\n<p>Included in the proposed amendment are Kristi Johnson, principal investigative analyst of the Title IX office; Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs; Sandra Vasquez, associate dean of judicial affairs; and Brian Quillen, also principal investigative analyst of the Title IX office.</p>\n<p>Estrada said the university has not yet seen any amended complaint.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76691\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76691\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/","id":2424,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2423,2422,2421],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":79,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
