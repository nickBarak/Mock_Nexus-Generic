The old Ike’s building is newer – the infrastructure and everything is better. Since [the Trigo location] doesn’t have air conditioning, our employees will feel much better at the new location.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also noted that in the winter, when it rains more often, his customers didn’t have a place to sit since the current location is limited to outdoor seating. He added that Mojo looks forward to being able to provide indoor seating at the new location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before setting up shop on Trigo, Wang had been skeptical about the location. “When I first came here, even my employees said, ‘You made a bold move coming into this location.’ I had seen it change hands between 805 Kabob and Café International a couple times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang cited lack of kitchen space at the current location as another important factor in the move. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The space [at the current location] is limited and people are often complaining about us not being able to keep up with their demand. So, moving into a larger space gives us more storage and cooking space to turn over that demand and give customers what they need,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also hopes that being closer to campus and the more popular parts of I.V. will help with business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I’m in I.V. I go walk around at different times of day and observe the busiest parts. Trigo is dead on the weekends, and the busiest street is Pardall and the area where Woodstock’s is. Sometimes people may feel like Mojo is such a long walk from there, but now, more people will be able to try us since we are closer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had also heard of people having trouble finding the current location and thinks that the newer location will make for easier access, especially because many people “know Ike’s was there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ike’s closed abruptly in April and moved to a new location in downtown Santa Barbara. </span><a

400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the status of the mold, Wang said, “I did follow up with the property owner, and they said the mold situation was resolved.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A representative from Icon Property Management declined to comment on the situation.</span></p><div

</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concert, performed by UCSB’s official University Carillonist and lecturer Wesley Arai, was composed of an eclectic mix of music including contemporary songs composed specifically for the carillon, classical songs by composers such as Mozart and pop hits like “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen as well as the songs “Blackbird” and “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” by the Beatles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dozens of students and families gathered on the lawn under Storke Tower for the concert, sitting on folding chairs and towels while others walked or cycled by, captivated by the sight and sound of Storke Tower bellowing for miles around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 61-bell, 5-octave carillon – the 11th largest in North America, according to Arai – sits high in the tower, at 175 feet in the air. The piano-like instrument is played with fists and feet, rather than fingers. The stronger the batons are pushed, the harder the clapper strikes the bell and thus the greater the volume produced, Arai explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most important thing I want is for people to realize that it’s a musical instrument … [the hour chime] that part is automated but the music you hear is played by a real person,”  he said. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89703\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-02/let-the-bells-ring-carillon-concert-series-celebrates-towers-50th-anniversary/storke-bells_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89703\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89703\" data-attachment-id=\"89703\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-02/let-the-bells-ring-carillon-concert-series-celebrates-towers-50th-anniversary/storke-bells_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Storke Bells_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89703\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89703\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 61-bell, 5-octave carillon is the 11th largest in North America, according to Arai. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arai has been playing the instrument since his time at UC Berkeley, where he received his undergraduate degree in mathematics and statistics and later obtained his master’s degree in mathematics at UC Los Angeles.

There are less than 700 carillons in the world, Arai explained, and less than 180 in North America. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a carillion instructor, Arai hosts concerts, plays on the weekends and continues teaching students, three at any given time, how to play. These students get to practice in the tower on the weekends as well as on the practice carillon in the basement of the music department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It can be a hard instrument… No other instrument uses similar motions, except the organ, to a small extent, with the foot pedals,” Arai explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arai’s next formal carillion performance will be for the official 50th anniversary concert for Storke Tower on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019 at 2 p.m.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be performing several works, including some commissioned specifically for the 50th anniversary of the carillon.

after a post by a UCSB student about the missing gems was shared to the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada clarified in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the burglary had occurred nearly two weeks earlier, on Aug. 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Estrada, police responded to a 911 call around 10:55 p.m. that night from an individual who was inside Webb Hall at the time, working at their office. The individual, whose name and relation to the school was not listed, said they had heard “a large crash outside of their office followed by an audible alarm.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police responded to Webb Hall and discovered that several items were missing and that the gem and mineral display case was damaged, Estrada said in an email. No suspects were located following a search of the building. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The missing gems and minerals total 14 in all and include: one diamond, one legrandite, one mimetite, one beryl, one aquamarine, one tanzanite, one topaz, one cinnabar, one pyrargyrite, one opal, one rhodochrosite, one serandite and two pieces of gold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The police department can be contacted at (805) 893-3446. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a decade of perfecting his culinary skills, Rogelio Muñoz took an unusual approach to opening a business in Isla Vista; rather than operating a business out of one permanent location, Muñoz opens his stand, known as Roger’s Tacos, at various locations along Del Playa Drive on Wednesdays and Thursdays of each week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muñoz, who is originally from Tlaxcala, Mexico, charges $1.50 for tacos and $6 for quesadillas. For any house that is willing to host his stand, Muñoz offers 50 free tacos in exchange for use of the venue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He estimates that he serves around 100 customers each day his stand is open, totaling an approximate 600 tacos in addition to the numerous quesadillas and mulitas. He works the stand along with his nephew and his friend, preferring to maintain a small team in order to ensure quality of the food he serves and to build close relationships with his customers, he told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think food in Isla Vista is expensive. When the food and rent costs so much, the students are unhappy. I believe we are helping students by offering our tacos,” Muñoz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He initially learned how to cook while employed at a food truck in Long Beach called Los Tres Garcias, working as a chef there for two years before moving to a restaurant in Gardena, California, called El Antojito Tacos y Mariscos, where he stayed for another six years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After moving to the Santa Barbara area, Muñoz briefly worked at the Subway in UC Santa Barbara’s Arbor.

Frontier Communications, a telecommunications company; and Utility Tree Service (UTS), a tree trimming company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court documents, SoCal Edison entered into a “special use permit” (SUP) agreement with the federal government, agreeing to maintain land owned by the government by trimming branches and removing trees to prevent dangerous tree collapses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To carry out the agreement, the court complaint said SoCal Edison paid a tree trimming service, Utility Tree Service, to take care of its green space. UTS specializes in “utility line clearance work” and provides services such as vegetation management and storm and emergency response, </span><a href=\"http://www.utilitytreeservice.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to the company’s website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to the court complaint, UTS inspected a faulty tree but allegedly made no effort to clear the hazard. The tree later collapsed on power and communication lines, belonging to SoCal Edison and Frontier Communications respectively, and ignited adjacent vegetation, the court complaint alleged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The complaint also claims that Frontier Communications improperly maintained vegetation adjacent to its communication lines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brush fire soon manifested into a forest fire, engulfing an area with a length equal to the distance from </span><a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedImages/countyofsb/Content/Emergencies/reyMap08-30-16.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2138648331\" data-slb-group=\"89672\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista to Montecito.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among others, alleged damages to the land include “the mitigation, rehabilitation, and reforestation of burned areas; loss of and damage to timber, habitat, wildlife, watershed and earth protection… environmental damage… soil damage and erosion,” according to the court complaint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the SUP signed by SoCal Edison, the electrical company is mandated to compensate the National Forest Service for any damages incurred on the land, the court complaint alleged. After almost a month, the fire was extinguished but resulted in “suppression costs and rehabilitation costs in excess of $26 million,” the court complaint read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Aug. 17, the day the court complaint was filed, SoCal Edison allegedly had not paid “any part of the sum demanded by the United States” — an amount which was not disclosed in the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SoCal Edison, Frontier Communications and UTS did not respond to requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November 2018, SoCal Edison </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-02/southern-california-edison-admits-to-being-a-source-of-the-thomas-fire/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">admitted to being one of the sources of the Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which swept through Ventura and Santa Barbara County between December 2017 and January 2018 and ultimately burned over 281,893 acres of land.

CSD pictured at the first meeting. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that first meeting, I really remember the feeling of the weight of 50 years of activism on our shoulders,” Bertrand said. “People had fought for this for so long, and there had been so many efforts and so much love for this community that went into this long-term movement to create a local government.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inaugural board was composed of seven members: Bertrand, Vice President Natalie Jordan, Secretary Brandt and Directors Jay Freeman, Robert Geis, Father Jon Hedges and George Thurlow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the board’s seven members, five are elected. The other two seats are appointed by UCSB and Santa Barbara County to represent their respective interests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the district first formed, Bertrand was a student at Santa Barbara City College, while Brandt ‘19 and Jordan ‘18 were students at UCSB. Two long-term I.V. residents, entrepreneur Jay Freeman ‘03 and local reverend Father Jon Hedges, also won elected seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geis, a retired county official, and Thurlow ‘73, a university administrator, hold the appointed positions. Both are long-term Santa Barbara residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand and Brandt both said the different generations represented on the board, specifically the “diversity of viewpoints,” formed a more cohesive board, with Brandt pointing specifically to Geis’ years of previous experience in local government as an advantage the board would not have had otherwise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the big disadvantages of being young in local government spaces, which are predominantly older and whiter and more traditional, is that you don’t really have the context for a lot of things and why certain things are set up the way that they are and how to best go about things to achieve the outcome that you want,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Abboud ‘14, former Associated Students President and SBCC Board Trustee, took over as the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-11/community-services-district-hires-jonathan-abboud-as-interim-general-manager/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">district’s interim general manager</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2017 and as the permanent general manager in December 2018. The position of interim general manager was created to account for the district’s unexpectedly small budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-13/i-v-csd-shakes-up-board-leadership/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succeeded Bertrand as president in December</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; Jordan </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/term-in-review-i-v-csd-vice-president-natalie-jordan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has since left</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was replaced by new director Kristie Nguyen; Geis is now vice president, and the secretary position was eliminated. </span></p>\n<p><b>FUNDING: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district faced several crippling impediments at its formation, but none more so than one that loomed for nearly two years after its creation: a lack of funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board theoretically had the power to implement programs and make changes around I.V., it didn’t have the funding to do so. An eight percent utility tax on I.V. residents </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed in the 2016 election, with only 62% of residents voting yes.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It needed 66.66% of the vote to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Darcél Elliott had managed the campaigns for both the district and its accompanying tax. When the district passed but the funding failed, Elliott pointed to campaigns by I.V. property owners who had vocally opposed the tax.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In this election, fear won over hope,” Elliott said on election night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district’s funds would come from a yearly $200,000 grant from UCSB, but the money could only be spent on services the university agreed were useful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if the district failed to secure a tax by 2023, it would cease to exist, a deadline that haunted the newly formed district. So when the board placed a new tax on the June 2018 ballot, local campaigners ramped up their efforts to win voter approval. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-83520\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of the “Vote Yes on Measure R” campaign celebrate after learning of the passing of the tax.

Measure R promised improvements to parking, public safety, lighting and sidewalks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75% vs. 17.25%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eight percent tax has brought an influx of cash into the district. The district ended its 2018-2019 fiscal year with nearly half a million in spending compared to over $800,000 in income – a far cry from what it started out with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the next fiscal year, the district </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-19/i-v-csd-budget-sees-about-200000-increase-in-funding-for-next-fiscal-year/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expects a $200,000 increase in funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rounding up to more than $1 million, according to numbers released by the district in May. </span></p>\n<p><b>THE CSD’S FIRST SERVICES: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without consistent revenue, the district spent its first year setting up as many services as possible with its limited resources, which involved “lots of strong partnerships with other government agencies and non-profit service providers,” Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board’s first project was expanding community policing efforts. Community Service Organization (CSO) safety officers have always escorted students home on weekend nights, but the district worked with UCSB to set up in-person stations at streetside locations for students to seek help.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSOs — who almost always are UCSB students themselves — worked over 3,000 hours and provided over 300 escorts during the last academic year, according to numbers released in July. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re there not to enforce, but to help people, to give out water, to help people charge their phones, to give people an escort home and when there is a safety concern, they’re there to call it into the police,” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD has also focused on sexual violence-related issues, hiring the first </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpersonal violence investigator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to work within the UCPD and partnering with Standing Together Against Sexual Assault (STESA) to set up a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the district’s most recent initiatives is a community-led beautification program, where I.V. residents can report graffiti, trash, vandalism or lighting issues to the district. The district will then either send out workers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">houseless community members they hired to tackle these issues </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or forward the requests to the county if necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community,” Brandt said at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">program’s launch</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April.</span></p>\n<p><b>WHERE THE CSD HAS STRUGGLED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The directors have acknowledged that the board, in its first iteration, struggled to reflect the demographics of I.V.’s population – six of the seven board members are male, and Bertrand was the only person of color on the board until Nguyen replaced Jordan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen is still the only woman on the board, and Bertrand is the only member that identifies as LGBTQ+. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I say this as a straight white guy – it’s a huge problem that it’s only people who look like me who feel most empowered to get involved in local government,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We benefit so much from the perspective and the leadership of women and people of color, and it is really something that we, speaking for myself and for all of us, really try to encourage the next generation of leaders to reflect that and would like to see a more diverse board in the future.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand emphasized that the board did vote a “gay man of color” as its first president and a woman as its vice president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district has also stalled on its promise of a low-income exception to the tax, which it campaigned on ahead of the June 2018 election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last fall, more than four months after the tax had passed, the directors were still split on whether or not to implement the exemption, with some directors arguing that residents could expose loopholes to avoid the tax. The board has still not addressed implementing the promised exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9, 2018 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, the district has also failed to substantively address the issue of parking in I.V. — an issue it was formed to tackle. Parking in I.V. remains one of the biggest downsides to living in the tightly-packed neighborhood, with limited parking attached to houses and even fewer open spots available on the street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street parking in I.V. can also be dangerous; numerous students have posted on social media about windows being smashed and mirrors removed by drunk cyclists or a baseball bat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During larger events like Deltopia or Halloween, the university actively encourages students to purchase parking passes to move their cars out of I.V. and remove valuables from their cars. </span></p>\n<p><b>“</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the broader parking issue, I think that’s been one of those issues where everyone has made it very clear to us that it’s a difficult problem to solve, and that if we’re gonna do anything on it, we need to have the internal staff capacity to be able to put something together that actually works,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the future, we really need to have a professional come in and assess the situation and make some strong recommendations.” </span></p>\n<p><b>WHAT COMES NEXT?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD is tackling what is probably its biggest project yet – the revival of the Isla Vista Community Center (IVCC), a center that many I.V. residents thought would never exist. The center is set to have a soft opening in October and a grand opening in January or February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand noted that even before the I.V. CSD was created, he and Brandt attended meetings for the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to express the need for I.V.’s own community center. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89599\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/iv-community-building_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89599\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89599\" data-attachment-id=\"89599\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/iv-community-building_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1315&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1315\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Community Building_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=888%2C584&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89599\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=888%2C584\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"584\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=768%2C505&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C673&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89599\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The community center is set to have a soft opening in October. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At their board retreat a few weeks ago, the directors talked about their goals, both short-term and long-term, for the district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether it’s cityhood or not, all of us want there to be the strongest local government for Isla Vista,” Bertrand said. “I think our overarching goal was for I.V. to be a community where people can live comfortably, where someone can come to college here but doesn’t have to leave when they graduate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, this is a place where people come for a few years for school and there’s some people who’ve made their lives here.

As a student, Macias said she believes that art is commodified and generally something people cannot enjoy unless they have excess funds to pay for expensive art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just look at romance painters,” Macias said. “They were always court painters. They did portraits for royalty. They did marble statues, they painted churches, so [art] has always been a commission-based thing and it has always been commissioned by higher classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This realization led Macias to research ways to share her art with the “broke college kids” around her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to make her art more accessible, Macias puts her art on stickers, with sizes to fit Hydroflasks and lighters, and she creates poetry and art for Um…Magazine, an online student-run publication.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias has fallen in love with the I.V. art community and is an artist who believes even college students should be able to appreciate art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that is what I really like about I.V. art movements. It is so inclusive,” said Macias. She found UCSB to be elitist when it comes to art projects, only allowing incredibly skilled artists to produce art around campus, yet I.V. is welcoming to all skill levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in her free time, Macias has taken up denim painting commissions – an unconventional art form not often seen in I.V. She charges between $20 and $35 for the art, depending on whether the buyer provides their own denim.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like painting denim, not only because it is an easy way to get my art affordably out there, but also I feel like it makes my art mobile,” Macias explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend moving to Germany in July could not take acrylic paints with her onto the plane, so she gifted them to Macias a couple months before she left. Without a canvas and disliking the look of acrylics on paper, Macias painted on denim for the first time in the spring, adding flowers to her mother’s jacket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The denim jacket] was the coolest thing and it didn’t have any marks on it or anything. I had it all throughout high school,” Macias said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that painting on denim is surprisingly difficult in contrast to her familiar watercolors, which she considers to be the most forgiving medium due to water always being able to change the image.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with denim’s rough surface, the paint needs to be combined with a mixing medium and sealed with heat to make it last through a wash, and many layers of paint are needed to produce a bright color. Macias also found that her line work needs to be more precise with acrylics than with watercolors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias noticed that people were afraid to alter their own clothing but still wanted to have personalized art, which Macias said is why she chooses to create commission-based denim rather than selling original denim creations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People don’t feel like they have the time or the energy or skill to create something but that doesn’t mean they can’t.

But now, at the end of her second year, she does not believe that the program was made for people like her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man,” Eseka said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her experience with the Honors Program underscores an issue that has loomed over the department’s staff for years — the program’s demographic fails to reflect the diversity of students that exists in UCSB’s student body as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2018-2019 school year, UCSB boasted one of the most diverse student bodies of any college in the nation, snagging 14th place in “Best Ethnic Diversity” among public national universities by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US News &amp; World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2018/019172/top-five\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advertised by the university at the time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But the Honors Program told a different story. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost half of the 1,713 students in the honors program in 2018-19 school year identified as white or Caucasian, despite white or Caucasian students making up only about 30% of the total student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicanx/Latinx and Black/African American populations in the Honors Program represented less than half of their respective proportions in the student body, according to numbers from UCSB’s Office of Budget &amp; Planning in the 2018-19 school year. Chicanx/Latinx students made up about 12% of the Honors Program compared to 29% of the student body; Black/African American students made up about two percent of the Honors Program compared to five percent of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-KN8eC\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of UCSB Undergraduates Campuswide vs. in the Honors Program, 2018-19\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KN8eC/3/\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Stacked Column Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of nearly 40 Black students in the program, Eseka doesn’t always see diversity at program activities, such as honor seminars, and she said the university could be doing more to support people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The chance of me being the only Black person in that class is really high and sometimes maybe as an honors [student], you might get second looks, like ‘Are you in the right place?’ and you have to be like ‘Yeah, I am,’” Eseka said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Eseka, feeling comfortable in the Honors Program is key to recruiting and retaining people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Diversity is really necessary to encourage more people to come to the program and then to stay in the program, so you don’t feel lonely or feel left out or singled out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And of the new honors students enrolling for the 2019-2020 school year, diversity statistics aren’t improving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the incoming group of freshmen – the class of 2023 – invited to join the Honors Program, almost half of the students are white. Chicanx, Latinx and African American students collectively make up less than 10% of the honors-eligible students. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-eoOjm\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of Incoming UCSB Freshman Admitted to the Honors Program, Fall 2019\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eoOjm/6/\" height=\"458\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, associate vice chancellor for undergraduate education, is one person in the honors departments who has kept the issue of diversity on his radar. When he first started to look more closely at the honors department about three years ago, Stopple noted several concerns with the way the program had been functioning, particularly with how the program included and supported diverse student populations at UCSB.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a high rate of attrition, of students not staying in the program. There was also a concern that the program didn’t represent the diversity of UCSB [because] it was not particularly diverse,” Stopple said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But three years since Stopple’s arrival, the diversity of students in the program still lags behind the diversity of the campus as a whole. Stopple said his office has worked in several ways to modify the program to support students of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those efforts is the collaborative Q&amp;A panel discussion put on in May 2019 by Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the honors department. Over a hundred first-year students who were on track to meet the honors requirements were invited to attend the information panel to hear from current EOP honors students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said the panel, which he started in 2017, has been effective in recruiting more diverse students to the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eseka spoke alongside Stella Delgado, a UCSB third-year history of public policy and anthropology double major, as panelists during the event. The two discussed EOP students’ concerns about the “intimidation” factor of the Honors Program. Some students felt the “elitist” reputation of the Honors Program was something that gave them reservations about applying, Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Delgado, the program’s lack of diversity points to “the different challenges students of color face on campus and the different challenges students from lower-income communities also face.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a student of color and a low-income student, I’ve had to maintain having a job for most of my time at UCSB, which has taken away from academics,” Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can enter the program in two ways: by being invited into the Honors Program when admitted to the university or by applying to the program the summer after their freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising sophomores are required to adhere to a 3.5 GPA and 36 letter-graded units requirement to enter the program, Stopple said.  Students can apply for the program in July and are admitted so long as they meet the GPA and unit requirements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said GPA is a “crude” metric and that he “would prefer to do something different.” But for now, due to “limited resources,” the honors department cannot incorporate more criteria for their application process besides the “purely quantitative” measures currently in place, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple did, however, lower the GPA requirement for the honors program from 3.6 to 3.5 in June 2017 in order to include more students in the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several advantages that come with being in the Honors Program; one, Stopple said, is having priority enrollment, which allows honors students to be among the first to enroll in classes during pass times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other advantages that come with being in the Honors Program include access to special academic advising, extended library privileges and academic and community service opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The promise of one-on-one time with professors, building relationships for letters of recommendations and beefing up resumes with honors status draws many students to the program. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michelle McKee, a recent graduate of the Honors Program, said “it’s very hard to get one-on-one time with the professors and to really talk with and work with the professors” without having the advantages of the Honors Program.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She joined the Honors Program after her freshman year and said the perks benefitted her education at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The day-one pass time is a plus,” she said. “But I also just knew that there were a lot of great opportunities if you were involved in the Honors Program including these really cool honors seminars and I’ve just been able to take so many interesting classes that I wouldn’t have taken otherwise.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB honors student, Michael Stallworth, said his experience in the Honors Program helped him get settled into the university and allowed him to “work with other people who are like-minded and just want to… achieve as much as they can.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth noted that a diverse honors program would indicate a university that adequately supports students of color and students from unique backgrounds, something still in the works at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It just shows that we have people from different communities who are able to be successful at UCSB and still be able to take advantage of the opportunities that are offered,” Stallworth said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the experience of each student in the Honors Program varies, many agree that increasing and supporting diverse populations in the program remains an important goal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know how much more opportunities and advantages I get being in the Honors Program between volunteer opportunities, earlier pass times, separate advisors,” said Zeina Safadi, an honors fourth-year political science major. “And so it would be disheartening to think that it was only to a specific group of students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Eseka said the root of the problem is in the way minority students perceive the Honors Program, and given the unique challenges they already face at UCSB, honors could be exactly what these students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You hear honors [and] you think ‘I’m not meant for this,’ not because you don’t have the credentials, but just because… historically, as a low-income first generation minority, you’ve…  had so many barriers that have prevented you from getting here faster or at the same pace as others.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Eseka, the Honors Program makes achieving her academic and career goals a little bit easier. The distinction of being in the Honors Program in college is an edge that she said she needs to accomplish her goals after college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s one reason why I keep on going because I know I’m gonna hit so many barriers.

Tragedy) was chosen for the director role because of her history of activism. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years ago, Collins Puente joined this seaside community as UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) community advisor. She was recruited for the position following the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/five-years-later-i-v-honors-victims-of-2014-shooting-with-recreation-of-original-vigil/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2014 Isla Vista tragedy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because, as she put it, the community wanted to see tangible changes in the culture, social services and space in I.V.: “There was a strong need for healing from the tragedy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente credited her time at A.S. for preparing her for the role of the I.V. Community Center (IVCC) director. While working for A.S., she focused on community-based initiatives, tackling several projects and focusing on “solving everyday problems that the residents of Isla Vista faced, like tenant issues, eviction, mental health, alcohol and drugs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente, who was exposed to activism growing up as a child in Guatemala during its Civil War, was selected for her role based on her history as an activist, she said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the path toward creating the center, let alone hiring a director, was not linear; the building housing the first community center in I.V. was sold in the 1970s, and financial setbacks prevented the community from building another. It wasn’t until 2012, after the county </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?fbclid=IwAR3QaUeBMMhQK_y2x2568or0Cmjdyrxma-7hGTLh3PsmHbDRalDbqA86r1E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purchased the center’s current location</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 976 Embarcadero del Mar, that steps towards actively creating a new center began.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center will have a soft opening in October with a grand opening in either January or February 2020, according to an update posted to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Facebook page. Collins Puente officially began her position on Aug. 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Collins Puente, the IVCC will act as a hub for I.V. residents, addressing the various needs of the community. Puente will work with the IVCC Advisory Board, which is currently being filled, to “ensure that the values and priorities of community members are thoughtfully taken into account in order to inform the strategic direction, vision, and programming of the new Community Center,” according to a press release sent out by the I.V. CSD board of directors in mid-July.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advisory board will be composed of several members of the community, some of whom have already been elected by the I.V. CSD. At the Aug. 13 I.V. CSD meeting, the board voted to postpone its vote on the final non-profit seat on the board until its Aug. 27 meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new IVCC director position is funded by a $177,000 one-year grant from the I.V. CSD to Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) in order to manage the development, fundraising, programming and strategic future of the center, the press release said. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I intend for the community to feel a sense of co-ownership over the space so that it can contribute to being a model of collaboration.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said that Collin Puente’s experience with social justice through nonprofit work will help create a “collective vision” for the center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been lucky to know and work with people in Isla Vista who are incredibly dedicated to building community – none more so than Diana Collins-Puente. As the Director of Community Affairs in Associated Students, she advised me and countless other students who sought to make a difference,” Brandt said in an email statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vistans have been fighting for a community center for over three decades, and I can’t think of a better person to implement our collective vision than Diana.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente has big plans for the future of the community center, hoping to balance the needs of the UCSB student population living in I.V. with the rest of the community. She hopes to craft the IVCC into a multi-use space, which would include hosting exercise and nutrition classes as well as a wide range of recreational and self-help activities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has a need for classrooms, so the space could potentially be used for that, while also providing a practical space for the rest of the community. Classes would be offered to them as well, ranging from legal classes to self-help classes, and we plan to include a demonstration kitchen,” Collins Puente said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente noted that plans for the IVCC are rooted in her involvement with the Pardall Center – a UCSB-operated collaborative space located in I.V. – for the last five years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want the IVCC to do what the Pardall Center couldn’t,” Collins Puente said. “The needs of the community have simply been too large for the Pardall Center, so the IVCC will address the larger projects that can’t be sustained at the Pardall Center.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente also plans to work with the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District, which will manage the recreational activities and play a role in the development of the space, alongside the IVYP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I intend for the community to feel a sense of co-ownership over the space so that it can contribute to being a model of collaboration,” Collins Puente said. “The center really speaks to the very unique nature of how I.V. has been able to support the building of institutions like the IVYP, the IVCC, and the I.V. CSD… It is a hub that brings together diverse members of the community that allows for us to engage with each other.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a pride in it being a community effort.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-89565\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Orientation staffers like Parent Liaison Melissa Medina were able to reach out to Spanish-speaking parents on the first day of orientation sessions to let them know of the new program. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for the first time, this summer’s batch of orientation programs presented nearly all of the workshops in both English and Spanish. According to Stephany Romero, assistant director of UCSB Orientation Programs &amp; Parent Services, the change came about after she recognized the demand for the full program in Spanish and got to work recruiting department representatives for Spanish workshops.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero assembled the Orientation for Spanish-Speaking Parents Committee with colleagues from various departments, such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the College of Letters and Science, and began the task of translating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were able to translate a lot of the material that is already in our English orientation into Spanish and quickly find presenters from those offices to do those presentations,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quick turnaround necessary for the program, along with the task of translating, did not give the Orientation Programs office the opportunity for as much outreach to parents and students as they had hoped, Romero said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, she believes the program was still a great success this summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Considering we didn’t advertise a lot, we got a pretty good turnout,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, orientation staffers like Parent Liaison Melissa Medina were able to reach out to Spanish-speaking parents on the first day of orientation sessions to let them know of the new program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of those parents actually didn’t know there was a Spanish parent orientation program and would come hoping they would just be able to understand something off of the English one,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were so relieved when we approached them and let them know.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina, a fourth-year sociology and comparative literature double major, enjoyed working directly with the Spanish-speaking parents for most of the two-day sessions, as she could personally relate to their questions and concerns for their new students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a [first-generation student] from immigrant parents, I was able to give them my experiences of what it’s like being a student in the university,” she said. “I think that really helped them feel more comfortable with their students coming.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the goals of parent orientation is to encourage students and parents to create an open line of communication about academics, Medina said. Giving Spanish-speaking parents this same opportunity is equally as important, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would give parents genuine stories of things I wish I would’ve been able to speak more to my parents about,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to college can be especially hard for first-generation students and their parents if they have no experience with universities, Medina emphasized. She said something as simple as giving Spanish-speaking parents a translated list of campus resources helps them feel more comfortable about the university their children are attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a lot of us don’t realize is the university is such a foreign space for people who haven’t experienced it, and it can seem very intimidating… I know now that if these parents have information, they’re able to support their students and be here for them, provide them with resources and answers and let them know they belong here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of the program is personal for Romero as well, who, as a first-generation alumna of UCSB, has a background similar to those of the students she helps with the Spanish parent orientations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came to this school, and I was also [first-generation],” she said. “And I know that if my mom had known some of the information that we have provided to our parents now, my experience here would have been 100% different because I would have had the proper support.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero said this program will allow Spanish-speaking parents to support their students in ways that other parents have already had the opportunity to; parents now have knowledge of campus resources to be able to answer questions that students might have regarding academics because they had the opportunity to communicate with department representatives directly at orientation, according to Romero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For me, it’s a major deal they get the same information the other parents are getting so that they’re as well informed,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina said she and her co-workers also received a lot of support from staff of the English-speaking program, who along with other UCSB staff were excited to see the Spanish events taking place and “would always hang around or peep into the presentation[s].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the translated material established and ready to go for future summers, the program aims to expand advertising efforts and add more department presentations to its schedule and possibly even work with the other UC campuses and their orientation programs, according to Romero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anytime I see a parent, I envision my mom and the happiness she would get to not only be given information, but to be seen as a normal human being, not just some foreign person,” Romero said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They are present, they also need help and they are also parents trying to support their child.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Thirty six died and nearly one hundred were injured across the three mass shootings, which all happened within the span of a week.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gathering was organized over Facebook by Armbruster-Sandoval and Amanda Pinheiro, a graduate student in the UCSB Global Studies department, less than 24 hours earlier. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcus Lopez, a local activist and Chumash native, opened the vigil with a blessing and performed a native healing song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees were invited to step forward and speak their minds. Most messages centered around community and a common humanity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that power is found in the community,” one attendee said. “We must stand together as a community. It is the answer. We must demand from politicians the responsibility to act. When we get there, we’ll be back as humans together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are no agendas here tonight other than the human agenda,” another gatherer said, alluding to the political nature of the debate that has sparked across the country in response to the three shootings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emiliano Campobello </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a UCSB alumnus, local activist, co-chair of Santa Barbara Standing Rock Coalition and co-founder of The Climate Mobilization’s Santa Barbara County chapter </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> condemned the racist motivations of the El Paso shooter who opened fire at a crowded Walmart. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shooter admitted to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/us/el-paso-suspect-confession.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“targeting Mexicans”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and, in his manifesto, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/us/politics/trump-mass-shootings.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the “attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Donald Trump, who has </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/11/business/media/el-paso-killer-conservative-media.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">referred to the northern migration of asylum seekers from Latin America as an “invasion,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been criticized this week for similarities between his words and those of the shooter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The rhetoric that’s coming out of the White House right now is really disturbing,” Campobello said. “Now, are we going to have to be afraid to be brown and go to Walmart?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campobello, who is also a professional muralist, musician and descendent of the Yaqui and Huichol tribes, performed a song on the Native American flute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Music gets past the mind,” he said. “Language kind of gets stuck, even if the words have certain meanings. Music and melodies… get into the heart space. And as that space can open up, we can tap into a field of love. And that is what we really need right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others reflected on their hope for future action to prevent such tragedies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think hope is sometimes the only thing that we have to hold on to,” said one attendee. “But it is powerful. Because hope can lead to action. If we all put in our little piece of work, we can transform our communities, we can transform our state, we can transform our country. You each have a lot of power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I see an awakening,” said Campobello. “People are less able to remain complacent and are being called to action because things have been so bad. That’s where I see hope.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89519\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89519\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/","id":2014,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[2013,2012,2011],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Second Aggravated Assault Occurs in Nearby Area, Suspect at Large","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2019-08-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As of Tuesday evening, the suspect in the two assaults has not been apprehended. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office is investigating two aggravated assaults that happened near UC Santa Barbara — which police believe were perpetrated by the same suspect — and were reported less than 72 hours apart, according to a press release sent out Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sheriff’s office is still currently searching for the suspect, who is described as a white male between 40 and 60 years old, with a height between 5’10” to 6’00” and a weight around 175 to 200 pounds. He also had “a dirty white beard, [was] wearing mussed clothing or dirty in appearance.” He may be driving an older, four-door gray car that looks “similar to a Chevy Volt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first victim said her attacker “smelled heavily of alcohol”; the second said he smelled like marijuana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Tuesday evening, he has not been apprehended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first assault occurred on Saturday afternoon around 12:30 p.m. along a creek near Phelps Road and Ocean Walk Lane, when the suspect grabbed a 22-year-old female jogger by the shoulder and arm “in an attempt to pull her closer to him,” according to an initial </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-10/timely-warning-issued-for-assault-on-campus-adjacent-property/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim punched at the suspect in an attempt to break free, but the suspect then “grabbed the victim by her shoulders and punched her in the face,” according to the initial timely warning. She was able to break free and run back to her house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim sustained “redness and swelling” to her face during the assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second assault occurred Monday evening at approximately 10:30 p.m. An 18-year-old female was waiting for friends by her car in the Haskell’s Beach parking area in Goleta when she noticed a man sitting in a dark-colored vehicle nearby, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man then approached her, placed his hand on her back and asked her if she was OK. He then “reached under the front of her shirt and sexually assaulted her,” according to the release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim then “kicked at the suspect, striking him in the groin area.” She then ran to her friends for help, while the suspect fled to his vehicle and drove away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proximity of the attacks, similar suspect descriptions and similar locations, being “isolated areas near rural access,” led the Sheriff’s Office to believe the assaults were perpetrated by the same suspect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone with more information about the suspect can contact the department at (805) 681-4100 or submit an anonymous report </span><a href=\"http://www.sbsheriff.org/anonymoustips.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
