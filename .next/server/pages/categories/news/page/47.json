The Public and Mental Health Commission was approved for $26,000 for this year, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>“Around $10,000 is specifically for the Mental Health Conference,” he said. The rest of the money would be allocated toward honoraria, marketing and projects.</p>\n<p>In the past, the Mental Health Planning Committee, an independent entity, has planned the annual Mental Health Conference. This year, the Public and Mental Health Commission plans on helping the committee.</p>\n<p>The executive board of the Public and Mental Health Commission will have a conference coordinator position dedicated to Mental Health Conference planning, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>The executive board will also include co-chairs, policy analysts, a mental health special projects coordinator, a public health special projects coordinator, a nontraditional first generation representative, an event/program director, a QTPOC representative, a financial coordinator and a marketing outreach director among others.</p>\n<p>Kaayal plans to be one of the co-chairs alongside Bongi Makatini, a fourth-year biological sciences major and Spanish minor.</p>\n<p>Makatini reached out to Kaayal after seeing the work he was doing regarding mental and public health. After the resolution passed in March 2018, Kaayal and Makatini came together during Spring Quarter 2018 and worked on the commission over the summer.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t want to step on the toes of the great work that’s already been done on campus, but we really wanted to see A.S. taking more of a stand to try to help tackle different issues regarding mental health here on campus,” Makatini said.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Committees already approved Kaayal and Makatini for the co-chair positions and submitted the two appointments to A.S. President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>Kopel has sent those appointments to A.S. Senate, and A.S. Senate now must vote in favor of the appointments. The Senate must also approve all other executive board appointments.</p>\n<p>Even though the executive board has yet to be approved, Kaayal and Makatini have started planning prospective projects.</p>\n<p>One of the projects involves free flu shots for UCSB students, according to Kaayal. The project would be funded by the commission.</p>\n<p>“We’re also working with student health and library administration and custodial services to start placing hand sanitizer dispensers around campus,” Kaayal said.</p>\n<p>“We’re starting to target the library first and then hopefully branch that out to the UCen and lecture halls.”</p>\n<p>Makatini mentioned the toll the quarter system takes on the mental health of UCSB students, and how students who never had mental health problems prior to college “all of a sudden have anxiety or depression or any other mental health disorders.”</p>\n<p>“We really want to make sure that students have a central voice through Associated Students to be able to utilize these different resources,” Makatini said.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Slajchert</em></p></div>\n<p>At age 24, Slajchert has accomplished a lot.</p>\n<p>Last spring, he graduated from UCSB with a degree in sociology. During his time here, he was a member of the men’s basketball team for four years.</p>\n<p>Most recently, he authored a novel entitled <i>MoonFlower, </i>a coming-of-age book that draws on Slajchert’s real-life experiences, including dealing with the loss of his best friend, Luc Bodden, who Slajchert met when he was 17.</p>\n<p>Growing up in Oak Park, Calif., Slajchert was one of the stars of the Oak Park High School basketball team. It would be there where Slajchert would soon meet Bodden, a six-year-old with sickle cell disease.</p>\n<p>“I remember him coming up to me saying he was so happy to meet me, and he wanted to play basketball with me, and I just knew I had to do it,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>What Slajchert did not know at the time was that one of Bodden’s last wishes before heading into a year of isolation for a bone marrow transplant was to play basketball with him.</p>\n<p>From there, Slajchert’s relationship would continue to grow as he would visit his best friend from behind a glass wall. Something Slajchert remembers vividly from that time is seeing two pictures above Bodden’s hospital bed, one of him and one of Matt Kemp, a star baseball player most notably known for his time with the Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>\n<p>Slajchert said that moment put it in perspective how much Bodden viewed him as a hero.</p>\n<p>“I was only 17 when I saw that, and to see that Luc felt like I was just as famous as Matt Kemp was amazing,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, after four years of being best friends, Slajchert had to say goodbye as Bodden passed away in 2016 at the age of 10.</p>\n<p>Writing <i>MoonFlower</i> was one of the ways Slajchert was able to cope with the loss of his best friend. The very first page of the book is dedicated to Bodden with a phrase that says, “Smile more,” one of the last things Slajchert remembers his friend telling him.</p>\n<p>After beginning to write the novel on June 30, 2016, Slajchert finally saw one of his dreams come true as on Oct. 14 of this year the book was published.Then, just a few weeks later, on Nov. 9 the fires starting hitting Slajchert’s area of Oak Park. He and his family were forced to evacuate.</p>\n<p>“We really had no place to go. I had to call my mom and ask where to go, and she told all of us to pack up and head to Malibu. At the time it was a much safer environment, and we thought it would be all good there,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>One day later, the fire would jump the 101 Freeway and make its way towards Malibu.</p>\n<p>“At the time, I was afraid I was going to lose both houses I grew up in because I had no idea what was going to happen,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>After safely evacuating once again, this time from his mother’s house, Slajchert turned on the news. Hoping for the best, Slajchert did get some good news as his house at Oak Park was safe.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the same could not be said for his house in Malibu.</p>\n<p>“As I was sitting there with my mom watching the news, we saw our actual house go up in flames. My mom just kept shaking me, saying ‘J.D., that’s our house.’” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>“I tried to calm her down but it was extremely difficult for both of us. To have to watch our house on the news just go up in flames was horrific. It was one of the lowest points of my life.”</p>\n<p>Slajchert was devastated. A house he grew up in was gone in an instant.</p>\n<p>One of the things that kept coming to Slajchert’s mind was his friend, Ahrya, who had recently taken a trip to Jamaica. Once Ahrya arrived, he realized he had forgotten his debit card and only had about $100.</p>\n<p>Forced to eat minimally, Ahrya was struggling until he received support from a local woman who invited him to eat with her and her family.</p>\n<p>Once there, Ahrya asked what the woman and her family was doing at a hostel instead of their home. The woman informed him that their house had burned down and they had nowhere else to go just as she was handing Ahrya the food.</p>\n<p>After hearing that, Ahrya could not accept, but the woman kept pleading with him to please take it. After finally agreeing, Ahrya asked just one question: Why was she so quick to help him, a stranger, when her life was in shambles?</p>\n<p>The woman responded by simply saying that they had to share, that they wanted to give back. That story, along with Bodden, kept replaying in Slajchert’s head. Then, he finally made a decision.</p>\n<p>After seeing his house go up in flames, Slajchert decided he was going to donate 100 percent of his book’s earnings to those affected by the Woolsey and Hill fires in a movement he titled #MoonFlowers4Malibu.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people assume you have to have a lot of wealth or popularity to give back to others, but I don’t think that’s the case,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>“I feel like even though I am only 24 and this money could help me get my life started in a lot of different ways, I would rather donate it to those who need it more than me,” he said. “My family and I will be fine, we will figure it out, but there are a lot of people who cannot say the same, so this is my way [of] sharing and my way to keep pushing this message forward.”</p>\n<p>According to Slajchert, 50 percent of the book’s earnings from Nov. 11 onward will be donated to the American Red Cross until Slajchert’s reaches his goal of $15,000. The other 50 percent will be donated to people who were directly affected.</p>\n<p>Since starting the campaign, Slajchert has met with many people. He says while it sometimes becomes overwhelming because there are so many people who need help, what makes the process gratifying is “how selfless some of these people are.”</p>\n<p>Slajchert has said that many times people will meet with him not in hopes of getting help for themselves, but for their own friends that need it more than they do.</p>\n<p>“I would say that every person I have met with has referred me to five more people that need help more than them,” he said. “To me, it just shows the strength of the community.”</p>\n<p>To this day, <i>MoonFlower</i> continues to help Slajchert cope with tragedy. First, it helped him cope with the loss of his best friend. Now, it helps him cope with the loss of his home. And he could not be happier.</p>\n<p>“The idea of sharing with others has been the perfect distraction. Watching my house burn down was the saddest day of my life, but starting the campaign the very next day was the happiest,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, Slajchert would have been happy if people purchased his book because it would be a testament to his writing. Now, he is happy because the purchase of a copy goes beyond helping him and the reader; it helps those who truly need it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

resolution, authored by Senator Zion Solomon and seconded by Senator Christian Ornelas, also called for the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors to reject any and all future oil drilling proposals in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“I’m bringing this issue to Senate because I believe Associated Students can be used as an important platform to use to lobby legislatures [sic] within the community,” Solomon stated in an email to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>This project includes three separate oil drilling proposals in the Cat Canyon Oil Field, located in northern Santa Barbara county near Santa Maria.</p>\n<p>The first <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/WestCatCanyon.asp\">proposal</a>, from the Texas-based ERG Operating Company, would add new injection wells, drilling pads and processing facilities, as well as expand current pads.</p>\n<p>In the second <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/AERAEastCatCanyon.asp\">proposal</a>, the Shell and ExxonMobil company AERA would drill new oil wells via “steam fracking.”</p>\n<p>The third <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/PetroRockUCCB.asp#documents\">proposal</a> by PetroRock would also add new steam injection wells.</p>\n<p>In total, the project would add more than 750 new intensive oil wells in Cat Canyon, <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/fighting-fracking-and-extreme-oil\">according</a> to the Santa Barbara chapter of the Sierra Club.</p>\n<p>The resolution also calls on both Associated Students (A.S.) Senate members and Boards, Committees and Units (BCUs) with environmental mission statements — including the Environmental Affairs Board, Human Rights Board and Coastal Fund — to write letters to the Board of Supervisors declaring their opposition.</p>\n<p>The resolution also asks Chancellor Henry T. Yang to “reaffirm his previous commitments against fossil fuels” by issuing a statement against the project.</p>\n<p>“[The resolution] will both pressure our elected officials on a bigger scale and give environmental lobbyists more weight when they’re talking to the Board of Directors making this decision,” Solomon stated in an email to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s meeting, the resolution’s student sponsors — fourth-year environmental studies and Chicana and Chicano studies major Amanda Pantoja and second-year computer science major Dylan Kupsh — both emphasized the importance of students speaking out and signing petitions against the proposals.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the supervisors got in because of student efforts, so we want them to hear what we have to say,” Pantoja said. “UCSB itself is one of the greenest campuses. I want to ensure we reflect our green values in the community.”</p>\n<p>Pantoja pointed out during the meeting that the Cat Canyon Proposals contradict California State Senate bill <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB100\">100</a>, which puts California on the path for 100 percent fossil fuel-free electricity by 2045.</p>\n<p>“Going with these projects would go against what Santa Barbara and Goleta have voted for,” she added.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors will vote on these measures in early 2019, according to Kupsh. Currently, the supervisors are editing proposed Final Environmental Impact Reports.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

response to a lot of questions that people had [regarding the union strikes],” Isabella Liu, vice director and head of publicity USAS, said.</p>\n<p>“We just wanted to educate people and give them a space to communicate and open up dialogue where dialogue hasn’t been opened.”</p>\n<p>In October, several hundred UC workers went on their <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-23/afscme-begins-second-strike-of-the-year/\">second strike of the year</a>. The workers, represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), protested low wages and job outsourcing, among other issues.</p>\n<p>AFSCME is the the largest union of UC employees in California.</p>\n<p>Juan Donato, a lead groundskeeper who has worked at UCSB for 35 years, spoke during the panel about the strikes and working at UCSB.</p>\n<p>He said he found the AFSCME union to be a channel through which his voice could be heard.</p>\n<p>“Fortunately, UCSB is a public school, so we get to ask questions,” Donato said. “Unfortunately, when I ask questions myself, it doesn’t work. I get muted. But together with the union, we are strong. With the union, I have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Anna Fabian, a fourth-year AFSCME intern, spoke of learning about the labor movement as she went through her four years at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Coming to UCSB, I didn’t know much about the labor movement and I didn’t know about the hypocrisy that happens here,” Fabian said. “We learn so much in our classes about the mistreatment of workers, but it’s happening right outside our classrooms.”</p>\n<p>“After you learn so much about what is happening, you can’t just turn around and not do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>One-fifth of UC workers have faced discrimination in the workplace based on their cultural background, one-third reported not being paid overtime and one-half reported being overworked, according to a survey conducted by USAS.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the majority of workers reported not being paid a living wage.</p>\n<p>AFSCME members said during the panel they will continue to push for change, despite the fact that no changes came out of the October strikes.</p>\n<p>“We may not be able to see the results in our time, but it’s the legacy that I want to leave,” Donato said.</p>\n<p>“For my children, for the children of my grandchildren — in the long term, it is going to be worth it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Now, this experience from her college years is just one of the reasons she changed her mind about the profession and decided to pursue a career in police work.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing how well you remember that and then you can’t remember what you had for dinner last night,” Avila said, adding that she still remembers the name of the officer whom she accompanied.</p>\n<p>Now, a decade later and recently named the first interpersonal violence investigator for Isla Vista, Avila brims with enthusiasm for her position and the community she works in.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and the UC Police Department <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/csd-finalizes-contract-with-ucpd-for-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">created the position</a> in late November. A contract signed by the two allocates funding to a peace officer designated to investigate crimes such as stalking, domestic abuse and sexual violence both on campus and in I.V. with the latter previously falling to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Avila has spent almost four years working at UCPD when she was hired in 2014 after working at Guadalupe Police Department.</p>\n<p>Being the only woman at Guadalupe PD for some time, Avila was often assigned delicate cases, such as child sex crimes, through which she began practicing some of the skills needed for handling interpersonal violence cases.</p>\n<p>Avila’s training also includes courses on numerous subjects, including human trafficking in minors, sexual assault, trauma interviewing and a drug endangered children course.</p>\n<p>Being a mother and a “people person” are qualities that Avila cites as making herself a qualified and strong investigator for Isla Vista, though she acknowledges that sometimes her passion for helping survivors can be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I think I care too much. I get really attached to my survivors. I get really empathetic about their situation,” Avila said. “People might agree or disagree but I think that is a strength of mine.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of her position, Avila hopes to build trust between her and individual survivors as well as the general community of I.V. through community outreach, attending meetings and dispersing information about interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>“I think in general when we humanize the form and the badge and the officer, that barrier diminishes a bit and people are more open to come up to us and inform us of things,” she said.</p>\n<p>The implementation of a police officer dedicated wholley to processing interpersonal violence cases is a victory to several groups and individuals in the community, such as Briana Conway [[ok]], director of Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.), and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</p>\n<p>Relationships between survivor advocacy groups like C.A.R.E. and STESA with UCPD are crucial for informing survivors of their options with cases and facilitating difficult processes involved in case investigation, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>“When an advocate and law enforcement have a really smooth working relation, the likelihood that a survivor’s going to want to stay in that process is greatly increased,” she said.</p>\n<p>The position of the interpersonal violence investigator fills some of the “holes” that existed in the previous processes for handling interpersonal violence cases, Conway said.</p>\n<p>Efforts to solve cases are now more streamlined, reducing the number of times survivors have to tell their stories. Cases are also less likely to slip through the hands of officers who often have other cases that take higher priority.</p>\n<p>“To be able to have that compassionate connection to at least explain the legal process from their expertise could just be really helpful in the [survivor’s] decision-making process as well,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway has worked with Avila since she began at UCPD and describes her as an “incredibly kind and patient” officer.</p>\n<p>“I can say wholeheartedly, from how she treats survivors, [her work is] remarkable and wonderful, and survivors are in a much better place getting to speak to someone like her,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Despite her qualifications and support from community members, Avila acknowledges there are personal challenges that lie ahead in her demanding position. Being what she calls a “feeler,” Avila knows the realities of her job and her attachment to survivors takes a toll on her emotional health at times. She admits she sometimes cries about her cases.</p>\n<p>“You have to remember to exercise, spend time with my family and not get depressed because people are counting on me. My survivors are counting on me,” Avila said.</p>\n<p>After particularly difficult days, during the hour-long drive Avila makes from I.V. during the week, she listens to music, de-stresses from work and enjoys the scenic route back home.</p>\n<p>For Avila, it’s the small things that go a long way and make her passionate about her job. “Thank yous” and smiles are things she receives from survivors that are particularly rewarding.</p>\n<p><i>Jessica Reincke contributed reporting.</i></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Nov. 28, 7:21 p.m.]: Avila’s training included a drug endangered children course, not a “drug and danger children course,” as stated in a previous version of this article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

products and meats, as stipulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) website.</p>\n<p>S.N.A.P. benefits typically cannot be used to buy alcoholic beverages, pet foods, soaps, household supplies, vitamins, medicines and hot foods among other restrictions.</p>\n<p>Hot foods are the only temporary exception on the aforementioned list.</p>\n<p>The department will also provide “mass replacement of SNAP benefits” for those who experienced food losses due to power outages in the Butte and Plumas counties, the press release stated.</p>\n<p>There are currently five fires burning across California, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE).</p>\n<p>Two of the largest fires, the <a

Rides can cost anywhere from $3 to $6.</p>\n<p>“We thought that same concept could be applied to food security, so we decided to lay out this idea where we create a page for grocery rideshares in the same format,” he said.</p>\n<p>CalFresh coordinator and fourth-year psychology major Stephanie Perez also provided pivotal direction in the implementation of the program.</p>\n<p>“When I applied for CalFresh, I got approved for the program … but there was another barrier that was stopping me from getting groceries: transportation,” she said.</p>\n<p>“This is something that we really need on campus – transportation for students that really need to go to the grocery store.”</p>\n<p>Despite several programs on campus that address food insecurity – such as the Associated Students Food Bank – transportation still remains a barrier for many students, Etaat said.</p>\n<p>“Getting to places like Costco, Albertsons and Trader Joe’s can be difficult if you don’t have a car,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Nadia Abushanab, a CalFresh advocate and third-year environmental studies major, the idea for the grocery rideshare was sparked during the Food Security Retreat at Hastings Nature Reserve that took place in September.</p>\n<p>“In [the retreat] we broke out into groups talking about different problems with food security that we want to address,” Abushanab said.</p>\n<p>Melanie Leung, a second-year environmental studies major, used the grocery rideshare group to carpool with three others to Sprouts and Trader Joe’s soon after the page was created.</p>\n<p>“I’ve only done it once, but so far it’s been a good experience,” Leung said. “I think it’s a great idea because I find it a waste of gas when I go get groceries alone and feel a little less guilty if I’m bringing others that need to go as well.”</p>\n<p>Perez had similar feedback about her experience with the rideshare group.</p>\n<p>“I can pay $5 for roundtrip, rather than paying Lyft $10 for one way and $10 for the other way,” she said. “As of now, the rideshare group has been effective for me and I’m glad we got it started.”</p>\n<p>Perez says there is potential in the future for the rideshare group to transform into a school-affiliated carpool system.</p>\n<p>“We hope there will be enough data from the rideshare group to show that there is a huge number of students who need rides and that transportation is stopping them [from] getting the proper nutrition that they need,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>“Eventually we want it to transform into something bigger where the school provides transportation for students to take them to the grocery stores.”</p>\n<p>Until then, the group hopes to increase its membership to benefit more of the UCSB community. The group currently has over 400 members.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to pick up momentum and hopefully the message will spread and people will want to engage,” Etaat said.</p>\n<p>“This is a mutually beneficial situation. We are very new, but we are hoping to expand a lot.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Even though they are not officers, they give an appearance of an official person, official authority,” said Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“[With t-shirts] they feel more approachable by people who, one, are probably intoxicated, two, might be from marginalized communities who don’t feel comfortable around police personnel.”</p>\n<p>By the end of the night, SASA representatives set up several verbal agreements with the university to increase students’ access to information about interpersonal violence prevention.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-85022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patrisse Cullors spoke at UCSB on Nov. 15. <em>Katelyn Zamudio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The event, put on by the UCSB MultiCultural Center (MCC), has been in the making for nearly nine months, according to MCC Director Zaveeni Khan-Marcus.</p>\n<p>“[Cullors’] voice and the message she gives is so powerful. We felt that it was important for her to come to campus and talk about her experience,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Cullors, an activist and artist, spoke prominently about the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>She discussed how the acquittal of Neighborhood Watch Coordinator George Zimmerman after his killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin caused outrage among those in the black community and beyond.</p>\n<p>“It was a response, it was a guttural response to one of our tragedies of our generation,” Cullors said.</p>\n<p>She condemned Zimmerman’s trial and subsequent acquittal, stating Zimmerman’s defense “[tried] to build a defense that Trayvon Martin deserved to die.”</p>\n<p>Cullors, a native of San Fernando Valley, also spoke about growing up in a community which resented the police and intimately felt the effects of mass incarceration. She highlighted the paradoxes in the American justice system, exemplified by Zimmerman’s not-guilty verdict.</p>\n<p>“I sat with a contradiction of living in a country that has two million people in prison, one million of them black and George Zimmerman, a white-passing Latino, gets to kill a human being and go home free.”</p>\n<p>Fellow activist Alicia Garza’s subsequent coinage of the term “Black Lives Matter” in a Facebook post, and Cullors’ decision to attach a hashtag to it in a post expressing her frustration, led to #BlackLivesMatter becoming a viral phenomenon – and later, a tangible social movement.</p>\n<p>However, Cullors emphasized the continuity of the Black Lives Matter movement with regards to the past.</p>\n<p>“This concept of Black Lives Matter has lineage. It’s a part of the Black Power Movement,” she said. “We stand on the shoulders of giants.”</p>\n<p>Cullors emphasized the importance of becoming involved with issues beyond the confines of social media and fostering relationships with other organizations, such as the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement.</p>\n<p>“Contrary to the media, a hashtag doesn’t start an actual movement. It takes skills, it takes organizing, it takes commitment and it takes sacrifice,” she said.</p>\n<p>For those within the MCC, Cullors’ talk surpassed already-high expectations.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Abire Sabbagh expressed relief that Cullors didn’t avoid sensitive topics and instead tackled touchy subjects with grace and eloquence.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to sugarcoat anything. We’re going to talk about the struggles and we’re going to talk about how hard it is, but we’re also going to talk about what we do and how we build the movement that we need to liberate ourselves,” Sabbagh said.</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also admired Cullors’ ability to bring light to the issues by talking about her own personal experiences and how a sense of community and family gave Cullors a refuge from suffering.</p>\n<p>“She talked about all the hardship she went through as a child, but there’s also a sense of love,” Khan-Marcus said. “I’m absolutely thrilled. Her presence itself was incredible.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Coffee Organiks is simple: Coffee is delivered straight to a customer’s door anytime between 6 a.m. to 8:30 a.m Monday through Thursday, and 6 a.m. to 11:30 a.m Friday through Sunday, thus eliminating the inconvenience of idling at storefronts such as Starbucks or Caje for a morning cup of joe, said Trump.</p>\n<p>“If we can wake up Isla Vista with fresh coffee, deliver it to your door and cut out mediocre coffee that is victimizing our friends, then it’s a job well done,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>Trump estimates roughly three to four pounds of coffee beans are brewed weekly to meet demands.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks starts their day earlier than most, preparing to wake I.V. by roasting fresh beans around 5 a.m. Cold brew is also “soaked in a sanitized vessel that extracts the flavor from the beans,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>“We pack our bags, put our earphones on and greet the person with their coffee.”</p>\n<p>Customers can order 16 oz. of hot or iced coffee for $3.50 and cold brew for $4, according to the company’s Facebook page. For 50 cents, customers can add hemp seed milk, almond milk or wildflower honey.</p>\n<p>All orders come with cane sugar and half &amp; half cream and customers who provide their own mug will receive 50 cents off.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks sources its beans directly from farmers Trump has personally engaged with while working on coffee plantations in Central America. Beans from countries such as Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and many others, have already made their way into the mugs of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>Quality is the paramount aspect of Coffee Organiks and often a characteristic that is hard to come by in the coffee served in Isla Vista, said Trump.</p>\n<p>“[In I.V.] I don’t think there is anyone out there that can beat the quality of our coffee,” he said.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks’ first round of deliveries brewed more demand than expected. Trump noted in a Facebook post that the Peruvian blend sold out in a matter of three days.</p>\n<p>In addition to his Central American coffee blends, Trump is also looking to impress the caffeine-cravers of Isla Vista by securing an agreement with a chef in New York to expand Coffee Organiks’ menu to include domestic flavors as well.</p>\n<p>Trump has faith Coffee Organiks will continue to satisfy I.V.’s palate, adding they are “flirting with the idea of a coffee subscription” which would allow customers to have coffee delivered every Tuesday and Thursday on a weekly basis for a discounted price.</p>\n<p>Also in the works along is an app, which would allow users to order coffee through their phones, he said.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks is not Trump’s first experience in caffeinated enterprises.</p>\n<p>Trump’s first introduction to the coffee industry was during a trip to Central America in 2012. During his time in Atenas, Costa Rica, Trump gained knowledge about the process of producing coffee beans while working at a coffee plantation owned by the Carlos family, a family he continues to source beans from for Coffee Organiks.</p>\n<p>“I grew a stronger passion once I started working on the coffee fields,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>After returning to California to work as a chef for Google, Trump had a casual conversation about coffee with his roommates, which, after some experimentation and taste-testing, ushered the idea of a coffee delivery service into fruition.</p>\n<p>Trump came to UCSB after he was offered a scholarship in molecular biology. After only a year of being a Gaucho, he officially launched Coffee Organiks.</p>\n<p>“Nothing is better than someone who takes a sip of our coffee and is immediately in a better mood,” Trump said when asked about his favorite part of the process.</p>\n<p>All products from Coffee Organiks are brewed in a sanitized kitchen under a food handler’s license.</p>\n<p>Orders can be placed at Coffee Organiks’ Instagram @Coffeeorganiks or on the company’s Facebook.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

We make mistakes and we own up to them. We issue corrections when needed and we are open, time and time again, as to how our reporting process works.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> has a duty to the student body to keep them informed of relevant issues in their community. We also do our best as student journalists to hold elected officials accountable.</p>\n<p>We feel the need to write this editorial because the Associated Students (A.S.) 69th Senate is not doing that for themselves.</p>\n<p>The Senate has a duty to the student body to represent students’ issues, one they have not maintained since taking office.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Nexus’</em> point of view – as individuals who extensively cover Senate’s resolutions, meetings and more – the 69th Senate consistently fails to represent our student body and is, in no way, accountable to the people they were elected to serve.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate is a group of 24 students who decide how millions of dollars of our student fees are spent. The senators are paid $350 a quarter in honorarium and are required to fulfill specific duties, such as holding office hours.</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Senate as a whole lacks transparency. Below are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Senate did not have a public list of their office hours until the <em>Nexus</em> requested it during Week 6. The 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code mandates this list be “scheduled and publicly posted by the end of the third (3rd) week of each quarter.”</li>\n<li>They use Facebook to communicate Senate-related announcements to their constituents, despite the fact that you need to have a Facebook account and be Facebook friends with them to see anything remotely related to their positions.</li>\n<li>They did not establish a Senate bill database until after the <em>Nexus</em> created one last year in order to make every resolution easily accessible to the senators’ constituents.</li>\n<li>They demanded The Bottom Line (TBL) turn off a livestream at the end of a public Senate meeting, which TBL – and the <em>Nexus</em> – had every right to record.</li>\n<li>Their website is still not updated with the names and office hours of this year’s senators, even though it is the end of Week 7.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Senators are not holding themselves accountable; instead, they consistently act unprofessionally as elected officials who control millions of dollars in student fees.</p>\n<p>We do want to acknowledge the valuable work some senators have been doing. For example, Senator Zion Solomon has worked to compile finance reports that detail the amount of money allocated to organizations during Finance and Business Committee meetings.</p>\n<p>To our knowledge, the finance reports are only posted on Facebook, but Senator Solomon’s efforts show a commitment to transparency.</p>\n<p>Senators do good things. We’re not saying they don’t. However, many of them have not been doing the jobs they have been elected to do.</p>\n<p>Even the leader of Senate – Internal Vice President (IVP) Steven Ho, whose pay amounts to $3,000 a quarter – fails to take his job seriously.</p>\n<p>His job is to hold his senators accountable, to keep some semblance of decorum during Senate meetings and to ensure senators follow Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Ho fails to show professionalism, even during Senate meetings. Ho, as the IVP, sets the tone for how senators should conduct themselves during meetings.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/46381421_335573963663022_3500040927651561472_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1279546202\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">retweeted</a> a tweet from Senate minute-taker Isabella Liu, which stated “someone get me out of this meeting please.” Ho replied to the tweet at 7:26 p.m. with “someone save us please.”</p>\n<p>Later during that same meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://46498938_2203294369732002_1446147155357073408_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1131452933\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">tweeted</a> “this meeting has been going on in circles, I wish I could get a proxy.”</p>\n<p>Both Twitter accounts are public.</p>\n<p>What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, a UCSB alumnus stood up at public forum, identifying themselves as a “concerned Gaucho.”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to tell you one simple sentence, and I’m not taking any questions, but I recently realized that the <em>Daily Nexus</em> is really good for toilet paper and I want to recommend it to all of you. It’s really good to wipe your ass with,” the individual said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just trash, garbage newspaper so please use it to wipe your butthole with whenever you’re taking a shit, that’s my recommendation.”</p>\n<p>His words are what spurred this editorial, but they are not the focus of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead, we would like to call attention to the way the senators and proxies, as well as Ho, responded to this individual.</p>\n<p>In response to this individual’s words, senators and proxies laughed and clapped their hands over their mouths. One even bowed toward the podium as the individual walked away.</p>\n<p>Ho could be seen recording the individual and laughing. The video <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9540.TRIM_.mov\">was posted</a> on Ho’s Snapchat story with the caption “I have no words 4 dis.”</p>\n<p>The comments from “concerned Gaucho” were not said in order to provide constructive dialogue or a call to action. Rather, they were blatantly inflammatory and used to reap attention.</p>\n<p>A few members of A.S. spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> following these remarks, condemning the sentiments. Yet no one publicly addressed the individual’s comments for the rest of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Senators are not required to defend the <em>Nexus</em>, but there are standards they must adhere to.</p>\n<p>According to their own 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code, members of A.S. must “treat each other and those in the community with behavior that fosters a safe, inclusive environment for everyone. This behavior includes but is not limited to: professionalism, compassion, courtesy, civility, and respect.”</p>\n<p>We would have hoped senators would have acted in accordance to their Legal Code, as their response to “concerned Gaucho”’s remarks was not professional, compassionate, courteous, civil or respectful.</p>\n<p>Instead, our paid, elected officials laughed at the hateful comments.</p>\n<p>They did not keep composure – they joined in on the joke.</p>\n<p>This is a student government, and we are a student newspaper. To the world outside our university, it is easy to dismiss our student government’s actions as an inconsequential side effect of decisions made by 18 to 22-year-olds.</p>\n<p>However, these people are our future “real-world” leaders. From what we have observed so far, there is a dangerous precedent in motion.</p>\n<p>Maybe we’re asking for too much. But we certainly hope that’s not the case.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Santa Barbara began transitioning to UCPath at the beginning of this quarter, hoping to create a more streamlined approach to paying its workers, according to the UCPath website.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association released a list of demands to the University of California regarding </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath on Wednesday, calling for the system to provide restitution for students who have not been paid and for halting rollout of the system until problems have been addressed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara began transitioning to UCPath at the beginning of this quarter, hoping to create a more streamlined approach to paying its workers, according to the UCPath website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association (UCSA), an organization dedicated to advocating “on behalf of current and future students for the accessibility, affordability, and quality” of the UC system, said UC “has not been paying its student workers” since the implementation of UCPath earlier this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Checks that are received often are for the wrong amount,” the UCSA letter read. “With the number of students who rely on being paid on time to pay rent, buy groceries, or pay student fees to enroll in their classes this is unacceptable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A copy of the UCSA demands to UC are listed below:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Immediately correct the payroll system to ensure that workers will get paid correctly and on time, particularly for those with multiple jobs and those relying on fee remission;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Acknowledge the grievances that the UC Student-Workers Union (UAW) filed on behalf of ASEs at UCR, UCSB, UCLA, and UC Merced;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Provide reparations to all students affected whether or not they are represented by a Union;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Expand financial crisis services specifically for all students affected;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Meet with student leaders and UC Student-Workers Union (UAW) representatives to discuss how to best support students affected by these problems; and</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Immediately halt to the implementation of phases 1 and 2 of the UCPath rollout until the problems stated in this letter are addressed.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Doan, director of media relations within the UC Office of the President (UCOP), said 99 percent of UC employees have been paid “accurately and on time with UCPath.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each each campus transition to this new system, we plan for unforeseen issues by maintaining extra support staff to stay on following implementation,” Doan said in an email. “The additional staff and resources at UC Santa Barbara will be there at least through the end of the year to help address problems.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doan said UCOP has a team in place dedicated to helping students and looking at potentially </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“reimbursing students for interest or late fees due to UCPath complications.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We understand students’ concerns and frustrations, and we are sorry about the problems associated with any instances of delayed processing of salaries and benefits due to the UCPath transition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cierra Sorin, UCSB’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) President, said that while UC Santa </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barbara administrators have been working with the GSA to combat the issues stemming from defaulted payments, many of the issues must be resolved at the UCPath hub located at UC Riverside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The problem is that UCPath was designed to decentralize a lot of things, and so a lot of the struggle has been, and I think continues to be, things that our payroll folks and our department officers used to be able to do, they no longer can,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, students affected by the defaulted payments can apply for emergency loans, although Sorin believes the program should be more widely publicized in light of the payment issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said that university housing had been flexible with rent payments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin herself had not been paid in October, and as a result was not able to pay for her university </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">housing until the end of the month. She said, however, that she had not incurred any late fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What has been happening with housing is people have been encouraged if there is an issue with them being able to pay rent to send an email to housing,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how widely this has been advertised and it’s something I will be speaking with admin about, because I had been hoping an email would be sent out to all folks who live in housing and are potentially experiencing problems, and I haven’t seen one.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin lauded the UCSA demands for presenting a unified front to the UC on behalf of all UC students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I see this as is the UC community…[of] graduate students and undergraduate students coming together and telling the University of California that it is unacceptable that there continue to be this many problems with people being paid accurately and on time,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSA letter writes that UC Riverside and UC Merced experienced problems with UCPath when it was first implemented at those campuses in January 2018, without any structural fixes from the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These issues continued to occur months after the initial rollout, leading student leaders from UC Riverside to reach out to the Office of the President and the UC Regents last Spring. However, there have been inconsistent improvements since they first came forward and these problems have continued to persist when UCPath expanded to other UCs,” the letter read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB GSA sent out a survey to graduate students to collect responses about issues they’ve run into after hearing from the UC Riverside GSA about their problems with UCPath, Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We heard about a lot of the problems [UC Riverside has] had on their campus, and how they’ve </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">snowballed month to month, and so we wanted to see if we were starting to experience those same problems here at UCSB,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beside the typical problems like being unable to pay rent or purchase food, the issues with UCPath have left students unable to pay for classes or receive parking and transportation benefits, Head UAW 2865 Steward Avi McClelland-Cohen previously told the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW 2865 is the union that represents UC student workers, but primarily graduate students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to being low on funds due to defaulted payments, students then have to pay more money out of pocket to make up for the lack of benefits, particularly with transportation, added Sorin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin believes the root cause of the lack of structural reform is because the UC was unaware of the issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even here at Santa Barbara, [the GSA executive board] had a meeting with [Anne and Michael </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towbes Graduate] Dean [Carol] Genetti, earlier in the quarter,” Sorin said. “They had told us they were unaware of anything except fee remission issues up to this point because no one had shared information with us about what was happening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the UCSA has presented these demands to the UC Regents and UCOP, Sorin hopes more immediate and effective change is implemented.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I hope] that President Napolitano and the UC Regents take this seriously, and invest time and energy into fixing these problems immediately such that our December paychecks are delivered on time,” she said. “I’m not optimistic though.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Nov. 15  print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Senate meeting, Renteria said he believed the threshold of 10 percent is obtainable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June, A.S.
