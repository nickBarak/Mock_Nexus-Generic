After their first thrifting event with EAB, they participated in the Isla Vista Open Market, a flea market that hosts events at Little Acorn Park.<em> Courtesy of Isla Vista Trading Post</em></p></div>\n<p>Patrons of the trading post can take three pieces of clothing from the pop-up shops, free of charge.</p>\n<p>The founders see no reason to make a profit off of their passion for thrifting, instead hoping that their “three for free” rule will encourage people to pay their efforts forward and choose to donate their old clothes at a future event if they wish.</p>\n<p>Rothfield, a fourth-year communication major, initially pitched the idea for the trading post as a project for one of her communication classes in the fall.</p>\n<p>“Our project was to come up with something that would help the community, so I pitched this idea for something sustainable and fashion-oriented,” she said.</p>\n<p>Rothfield was inspired by the “free box” in Isla Vista, which are bins full of free clothing outside the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District building.</p>\n<p>The founders of the trading post planned their first pop-up thrift shop during Fall Quarter, but when the Thomas Fire hit Santa Barbara County, plans for the event were abandoned.</p>\n<p>The delay, as well as Rothfield’s graduation from UC Santa Barbara, left the future of the trading post up in the air.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sofia Willis, who now runs IVTP with Forsell, wanted to bring thrifting to Isla Vista, but lacked the means.</p>\n<p>Willis, a second-year philosophy and sociology double major, initially got involved in thrifting through the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB), taking to the Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page to round up clothing donations.</p>\n<p>Through Facebook she met Rothfield and Forsell, whose vision for the Isla Vista Trading Post matched her own and the three branched off to reinvigorate the project.</p>\n<p>“I wanted this to be not just about the environment, but also community, and fashion and self-expression, which is the direction [the project] was going in as well,” Willis said.</p>\n<p>To reach a larger scope of the surrounding community, the trading post decided to host its pop-up shop in Isla Vista rather than on campus. After their first thrifting event with EAB, they participated in the Isla Vista Open Market, a flea market that hosts events at Little Acorn Park.</p>\n<p>With shops hosted by student artists and vintage clothing curators, Rothfield thought the trading post would be a natural addition to the market.</p>\n<p>Forsell and Willis agree that they want to educate people about the human rights violations in the fast fashion industry and cited sustainability as the primary goal of the trading post.</p>\n<p>“We like to say that the fast fashion industry is the second dirtiest industry in the world,” Forsell said.</p>\n<p>They said, however, that their mission does not have a political agenda.</p>\n<p>The organization is comprised of approximately 15 dedicated students, five of whom hold official administrative positions. The volunteers meet on Wednesday nights to plan thrifting events, collect donations and postulate about the future of the rapidly-growing trading post.</p>\n<p>Ultimately one of the main goals of the Isla Vista Trading Post is to normalize thrift shopping and to welcome all people who are interested. Willis believes that thrift shopping currently belongs to a very specific group of people, which she hopes to destigmatize.</p>\n<p>“Right now it seems like thrifting belongs to a very niche group, sort of, and it’s not like everybody thrifts because it’s fashionable or cool, it’s kind of just a niche group that does it,” Forsell explained.</p>\n<p>Willis and Forsell said the next major step is to apply for nonprofit status in order to receive funding from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>\n<p>They are hopeful that with this funding they will be able to buy a storage unit, as they have currently been storing the enormous amounts of leftover clothes in their cars.</p>\n<p>While the trading post is a nonprofit organization, Willis, Forsell, Rothfield and the other members of their team have all paid out of pocket to get the organization off the ground. Willis said she sees the organization as an “investment” and hopes of one day buying a van and a storage unit.</p>\n<p>They also hope to plan a raffle for some of the high value items they have received as donations and would like to host an art show in conjunction with student artists and local businesses.</p>\n<p>In the short term, Willis and Forsell are looking forward to collaborating with WORD Magazine, Surfrider Foundation and the sustainability chairs of Greek life organizations as part of the Greeks Go Green initiative in order to bring the trading post to as many places as they can.</p>\n<p>“We’d like to expand past Isla Vista and inspire other college campuses and communities,” Forsell said. “And if this generation can get used to trading clothes, then future generations will start doing that.”</p>\n<p>“‘Remember when people used to buy clothes instead of trading them?’ That’s my dream, to be able to say that to my kids,” Willis said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the May 3 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

the University of California, announced her resignation from the position in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i> last week.</p>\n<p>Salvaty began as a Title IX coordinator at UC Los Angeles and continued to live in Southern California after she received the position as the first system-wide coordinator.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <i>Nexus</i> on April 27, Salvaty said the distance from Southern California to the UC Office of the President (UCOP) in Oakland was part of her decision to resign.</p>\n<p>“It’s a system-wide job, and it’s certainly doable to do from the southern half of the state, but I also spent a lot of time in Oakland and at the Office of the President and that’s where my office was,” Salvaty said. “Ultimately, I think it was starting to take a toll on my family.”</p>\n<p>Salvaty discussed her time serving in the position and said that the most gratifying part was seeing the diversity of the UC campuses while recognizing that they were all similar in their commitments to trying to protect students and faculty.</p>\n<p>She also said a rewarding part of her time serving in the position was the formation of the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">Title IX Student Advisory Board</a>. The board is composed of one undergraduate student and one graduate student from each UC.</p>\n<p>The board has been focused on clarifying Title IX procedures as board members believe the procedures can be hard for students to understand, according to Salvaty.</p>\n<p>“We’re in the process of changing our student procedures, not fundamentally, but adding a lot of clarity,” Salvaty said. “We’re trying to be more clear about how it works.”</p>\n<p>She said the board is considering potential amendments to the system-wide policy.</p>\n<p>The policy amendments stem from a four-year federal investigation that revealed UC Berkeley violated Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, UC Berkeley released a <a href=\"http://complianceresponse.berkeley.edu/pdf/Signed%20Resolution%20Agreement.pdf\">Resolution Agreement</a> outlining new requirements agreed upon with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), a sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Education.</p>\n<p>The changes to the policies are expected to be finalized by the end of February 2019.</p>\n<p>Salvaty’s replacement, Suzanne Taylor, previously worked as an OCR Civil Rights Attorney. Taylor currently works within UCOP as a Title IX principle investigator.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained that she believed the most meaningful work she did within OCR was in the area of sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“My goal in serving as interim is just to continue the great work that she’s done of building the office and continuing with prevention and response efforts and really identifying and helping with implementation of those practices by the campus,” she added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

<em>Courtesy of “The Laura Flanders Show”</em></p></div>\n<p>“The most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.”</p>\n<p>Those were some of the opening lines of Malcolm X’s speech at the funeral of Ronald Stokes in 1962.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 56 years to 2018, Kimberlé Crenshaw would argue X’s statements still ring true.</p>\n<p>Last Wednesday, April 25, attendees at Campbell Hall heard the words of Crenshaw, who popularized the concept of “intersectionality” nearly three decades ago. The event was organized by UC Santa Barbara’s MultiCultural Center and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.law.columbia.edu/pt-br/news/2017/06/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality\">Q&amp;A interview with Columbia Law School last year</a>, Crenshaw defined intersectionality as follows:</p>\n<p>“Intersectionality is a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It’s not simply that there’s a race problem here, a gender problem here and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.”</p>\n<p>A well-established scholar of critical race theory and law, Crenshaw spoke in front of a packed Campbell Hall audience.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply give a lecture to the audience, Crenshaw used a simulated dialogue between the late Martin Luther King Jr. and her colleague, renowned civil right activist and law expert, Barbara Arnwine.</p>\n<p>The imagined conversation gave life to Crenshaw’s intersectionality theory beyond what people have read or written on a page. Crenshaw told the audience the conversation was a reminder that although King strived for social justice, black women were not accounted for enough.</p>\n<p>Through Arnwine, she spoke about the way that prominent individuals like King and U.S. President Barack Obama upheld patriarchal beliefs.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major and black studies minor Nisa Smith said Crenshaw’s identity being similar to her own “made everything extra important” because she didn’t just talk about racism in a “one-dimensional” way.</p>\n<p>“People tend to only care about liberation as it pertains to them only. I feel like people are not always truly willing to do the work to eradicate their own privilege. Even if you are marginalized in your own way, you are also privileged in some way,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw discussed modern movements that have shed light on the role of black women in the U.S. #SayHerName is a movement created to bring awareness for black women who have lost their lives to police brutality and still have not been given justice.</p>\n<p>The words have been used in references to the killing of Sandra Bland, but before Bland’s name was even mentioned at Campbell Hall on Wednesday, a segment of Crenshaw’s dialogue asked audience members to hold their hands above their head if they recognized the names of victims of police brutality.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw first announced the names of black men such as Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Philando Castile and countless others associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, in which a majority of the audience’s hands remained up.</p>\n<p>However, once she listed the names of black women who are victims – Natasha McKenna, Michelle Cusseaux, India Beaty, Maya Hall and more – many started putting their hands down after the mentioning of just one name.</p>\n<p>As all hands in the lecture hall were no longer lifted, Crenshaw left a moment of silence intended to serve as a wakeup call showing the need for intersectionality and why it was created.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw’s perspective was not lost on the audience, including Smith, who said women should be given more recognition than they are currently given.</p>\n<p>“Black women are experiencing violence on the account of both their race and gender at minimum. These things shouldn’t have to be constantly said. People have to be bullied into giving recognition, attention and respect to black women,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Ingrid Banks, professor of black studies at UCSB, said she often uses Crenshaw’s work in her classes and lauded her influence in activism and academia.</p>\n<p>“One of Professor Crenshaw’s most important scholarly contributions is that she brilliantly argues that the limitations of anti-discriminatory theory beg for an intersectional approach in both Black Studies and Feminist Studies,” Banks said in an email.</p>\n<p>Banks said Crenshaw’s work is not “arrested” within academia and that her work often transcends into activism.</p>\n<p>“Her scholarly work finds legs in the activist efforts she makes on behalf of black girls and women. Both her scholarship and activism bleed intersectionality,” Banks said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story was printed on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeAngelo, a former police officer in Auburn and Visalia, is linked by DNA to homicides in Goleta in 1981 and is also believed to be responsible for two other murders and two attempted murders in 1979 in Goleta, according to the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 72-year-old suspect was living in Citrus Heights, California at the time of his arrest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, DeAngelo is tied to 51 rapes and 12 murders, according to Bruce Harrington, a brother and brother-in-law of two of the victims from Orange County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the 51 rapes and 12 murders, DeAngelo is also potentially linked to hundreds of burglaries that occurred between the late ‘70s to the mid ‘80s, according to SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeAngelo is suspected to have attacked a Goleta couple in 1979 while they were asleep at home. While both victims were able to escape, DeAngelo “evaded capture,” according to SBSO. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Dec. 30, 1979, two people were murdered in their residence near Goleta, according to a SBSO press release. Two people were also found murdered in a home that they had been housesitting near Goleta on July 27, 1981, the press release stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we commence the charging and prosecution of DeAngelo, this too, will be a team effort involving many jurisdictions working collaboratively and collectively together,” Ventura County District Attorney Gregory Totten said at a press conference held by the Sacramento District Attorney’s office on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After his brother’s death, Harrington struggled to “bring DNA in California to the forefront of forensic crime scene investigation tools.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early 2000s, he appeared before the Assembly, the Senate and Public Safety Committees in Sacramento, working to appeal to them about using DNA in their investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To the entire reservoir of victims out there, my sadness is with you.

Across the previous two years, Campus United (CU) had won seven of the eight available partisan executive seats.</p>\n<p>Campus United remains dominant in the A.S. Senate, after students elected 14 Campus United candidates and 10 from IVP.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Election Board, 8,233 undergraduate students, or 39.7 percent, voted in the election. This is the highest voter turnout since 2014.</p>\n<p>Students voted against the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/newcen-to-create-innovation-lab-pedestrian-path/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NewCen renovation project</a> with an 81.69 percent no vote. The project had drawn widespread controversy across A.S. and on social media, largely due to the project’s costs.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited and thrilled that the students had the opportunity to voice their opinion on this issue,” said Hieu Le, current A.S. president and one of the project’s primary supporters. “We need to listen to what the students have to say in terms of supporting a different funding model for it, and that’s something that I stand by.”</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel was elected as the next A.S president and is the lone executive candidate elected from CU.</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, the Isla Vista Party’s candidate for president, said he is undeterred by the loss.</p>\n<p>“It’s not as tough a loss as I think a lot of people think it was,” he said. “People really showed up for us. We had a lot of votes in every category; I’m super proud of all the effort everyone’s put in. It was never about me, and it never will be about me.”</p>\n<p>Dumlao also said he will continue to make change on campus and said he believes the election has encouraged more students from all backgrounds to get involved at the university.</p>\n<p>“For all the unrepresented students out there, for all the queer students, for all the brown students, for all the Pacific Islanders, there’s a spot for you out there,” he said. “Last quarter, the quarter before that, every quarter I’ve been here, I always think I don’t belong here at UCSB. And this race has really shown me that we do belong here.”</p>\n<p>Steven Ho with IVP won the internal vice president position against CU’s Anthony Pimentel by 636 raw votes. Ho is currently an on-campus senator in A.S. senate. Ho and Pimentel declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico of CU and off-campus senator lost to IVP’s Jeike Meijer by nearly 600 raw votes for external vice president of local affairs. Meijer has said she will be the first Native American to serve as a UCSB A.S. executive. Dycaico and Meijer declined to comment.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Mayela Morales won the external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) position against Madeline Loudon of CU. Both candidates declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Rose Ettleson lost the vote for student advocate general (S.A.G.) against Grecia Martinez. Ettleson told the Nexus she was not “afraid of any candidate winning” because she believes everyone is competent and qualified.</p>\n<p>“I’m ecstatic about the whole executive slate because every single one is going to do such amazing things. I’m obviously disappointed; I think Grecia will be a great student advocate general,” Ettleson said.</p>\n<p>“I am relieved, ecstatic — it’s been a very long two weeks,” Martinez said after the win. She said she was excited to work with the current S.A.G., Jack Tannenbaum, to analyze statistics behind the election results to see where the students fall on campus issues.</p>\n<p>At a somber post-election meeting, CU party leaders urged those who fell short of elected seats to remain hopeful and active.</p>\n<p>“When I look at all of you here, as a fourth-year exec, you know what I see? I see the future of this fucking campus!” Kristin Hsu, the current EVPSA, told the party. “This is not Associated Students United, this is Campus United!”</p>\n<p>“Whatever happened in there — fuck that!” she added.</p>\n<p>Kopel thanked the CU staffers for their help in her victory and echoed Hsu in telling the party to not give up their fight.</p>\n<p>“Campus United needs to stay united,” she said. “No matter what happens in there, we are the people who are best for this campus … We will come back again, and we will sweep again and again and again, no matter how long it takes.”</p>\n<p>A photo story from the night can be seen <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/in-photos-a-s-elections-2018/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence, Sanya Kamidi and Jose Ochoa contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Hsu said “Associated Students United,” not “Soviet Students Union” as previously reported.

district member” on the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which oversees special districts in the county. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Conflict-of-interest rules state that a public official has a “disqualifying conflict of interest” in a government decision if it is “foreseeable” that the official could be financially impacted by the decision.</p>\n<p>If a public official might be financially affected by a decision, they must recuse themselves from the vote in order to avoid bias, according to the rules, which come from the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC).</p>\n<p>There are exemptions, but none of them appear to apply to Tuesday’s vote, which took place at the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The position Bertrand is running for is the “alternate special district member” on the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which oversees special districts in the county.</p>\n<p>As people move into cities, the LAFCO makes sure spaces remain open and resources are protected. An alternate member takes part in LAFCO affairs when the regular members cannot be present or need to recuse themselves. For each meeting attended, the member makes $150 without benefits.</p>\n<p>Bertrand secured the nomination with four “yes” votes, one “no” vote and two abstentions.</p>\n<p>If Bertrand had not voted for himself and instead abstained, he would not have received the nomination.</p>\n<p>The FPPC didn’t offer a direct opinion on the matter since “only an investigation determines whether violations have occurred.”</p>\n<p>“Generally speaking, the responsibility is on public officials to avoid conflicts,” Jay Wierenga, the FPPC communications director, said in an email. He went on to say officials are recommended by law to avoid “even the appearance” of conflicts.</p>\n<p>David Seymour, another nominee for the LAFCO position, did recuse himself when his special district, the Santa Ynez CSD, voted to nominate him. Seymour, a 14-year veteran of the Santa Ynez CSD, left the room while the vote took place.</p>\n<p>“I had to leave, I left, I recused myself,” Seymour told the <em>Nexus.</em> “I can’t vote for myself. By going to LAFCO, there’s financial conditions and so you can’t do that. That’s against the law.”</p>\n<p>At Tuesday’s CSD meeting, Bertrand introduced his intent to run for the vacant position on the Santa Barbara LAFCO. While fellow directors Robert Geis and George Thurlow immediately mentioned and seconded a motion to place him in the position, Bertrand faced hesitation from director Jay Freeman.</p>\n<p>Freeman told the board it should throw its support behind Seymour, citing Seymour’s experience in and around LAFCO through the years.</p>\n<p>To that end, Freeman noted LAFCO’s emphasis on nitty gritty aspects of the larger county and said it would look bad if the I.V. CSD nominated someone who hadn’t attended enough LAFCO meetings.</p>\n<p>Going for this position would spread Bertrand too thin, Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“I like that you’re excited to do this, but it seems like a stretch given all you’re doing here,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand defended his qualifications, saying the LAFCO needs more younger folks and people of color in the way of diversity.</p>\n<p>He later told the <em>Nexus</em> that he has attended “quite a few” LAFCO meetings “over the past couple of years.”</p>\n<p>Thurlow stepped in, telling Bertrand to step down from facilitating the discussion since he had a direct interest in the outcome.</p>\n<p>Particularly, Thurlow said Bertrand should recuse himself from running the meeting, but “not necessarily from voting.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Bertrand stood by his decision to vote on the matter.</p>\n<p>“I still believe that what I did was within my rights and responsibilities,” he told the <em>Nexus</em>. “I’m still comfortable with it.”</p>\n<p>He directed the<em> Nexus</em> to the CSD’s legal counsel for further questions.

This would result in the loss of four to five one-way trips per weekday. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>At an Isla Vista Community Services District (IVCSD) meeting on Tuesday, Hillary Blackerby, MTD marketing and community relations manager, presented the changes to the CSD, the first time the MTD has presented to the I.V. governance board.</p>\n<p>Before the creation of the CSD, the MTD held community meetings in various locations in Isla Vista, Goleta and Santa Barbara to propose service changes.</p>\n<p>Line 15x, the SBCC/UCSB Express, runs between SBCC, UCSB and Isla Vista. The suggested changes would improve time performance, simplify the bus route and create more access to SBCC.</p>\n<p>The line will no longer switch directions midday which has previously caused confusion and delay, according to Blackerby. Bus service on Friday between 4:30 and 6:30 p.m. will also be eliminated as there are very few classes at that time.</p>\n<p>Lines 7, 10 and 27 will see “minor” changes that would overall improve time performance, Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>The changes on line 27, the Isla Vista Shuttle, include adding more time to each trip in order to decrease the delays. This would result in the loss of four to five one-way trips per weekday.</p>\n<p>“It takes a while to get through I.V. in a bus because of all the congestion on the street and obviously to get through safely we need to go slow […] When you do something like that [adding time to each trip] it’s not very noticeable,” Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>The MTD will also temporarily discontinue line 21x, Carpinteria Express, until the Highway 101 HOV lanes are opened.</p>\n<p>Every April, the MTD informs the communities they serve of the upcoming changes to the bus services, which are then officially put into effect in August of that same year.</p>\n<p>A year ago, the MTD p<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/\">roposed new fareboxes</a> that would allow UCSB students to tap their ID cards on the farebox instead of showing a sticker that is given out every quarter.</p>\n<p>This new technology has been implemented in a few buses and, according to Blackery, the MTD is “getting close” to fully integrating the new fareboxes.</p>\n<p>IVCSD Board Secretary Spencer Brandt brought up the possibility of creating or modifying a bus line that would allow students to access Calle Real/Fairview marketplaces, which includes stores like Trader Joe’s.</p>\n<p>According to Google Maps, students can take either the 11 or 24x bus lines toward Goleta and walk 20 to 30 minutes to get to the Calle Real Shopping Center, or take either of those buses and transfer to the number 7, Goleta Old Town, line and walk a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Since its start in August 2016, Line 28 has been a “rousing success” to the point where the MTD will eventually require more support from UCSB, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said that both of these issues are being discussed at MTD.</p>\n<p>Blackerby also said that because line 28 buses often get filled to capacity at the El Colegio and Camino Corto stop across Santa Catalina, people looking to get on at different stops along El Colegio are sometimes “out of luck.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print

id=\"caption-attachment-82740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">According to a press release from the union, 97 percent of workers within the union voted to “authorize a system-wide strike” in mid-April. <em>Courtesy of Roberto Young</em></p></div>\n<p>John de Los Angeles, communications director for the American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, said the union “exhausted” the bargaining process and the public employee relations board, which oversees labor disputes, declared the situation is “at a final impasse.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME’s 9,000 UC Service workers and 15,000 Patient Care Technical workers plan to strike from May 7 to May 9, according to a press release sent out Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>“It just doesn’t appear that we’re going to be reaching an agreement any time soon,” de Los Angeles said. “Strike is a measure of last resort.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME’s first local chapter within the UC system was created at UC Berkeley in 1948. Today, the union represents approximately 24,000 UC workers, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>The bargaining team, an elected body chosen to represent the workers, has the sole authority to call for a strike. The union’s bargaining team has met with the UC labor relations team nearly once every month for a year, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the union, 97 percent of workers within the union voted to “authorize a system-wide strike” in mid-April.</p>\n<p>The release also asked speakers invited to UC graduation events to support union workers by “boycotting university engagements until the labor dispute is solved.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME conducted the voting over two days at locations across the UC’s 10 campuses, five medical centers and research laboratories among others, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>A small group of UC Santa Barbara students held a protest in front of De La Guerra dining commons on April 16 in support of the workers. AFSCME and other union workers within the UC have also previously held several protests on the UCSB campus, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/court-case-could-bring-financial-strain-to-public-sector-unions/\">most recently</a> on Feb. 15.</p>\n<p>The protests and subsequent vote to strike come following a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/39pjpl3gf26b93t/A3299_PioneeringInequality_WhitePaperNEW_Web_lo-res.pdf?dl=0\">report</a> analyzing demographics of workers across the UC campuses written and released by AFSCME in early April.</p>\n<p>The report stated non-white employees, specifically those in African-American and Latinx communities, are “often hired into lower-paying titles,” while white people are “hired into higher-paying titles.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the report stated male workers were given a higher average hourly starting pay rate than female workers.</p>\n<p>The average hourly starting pay rate for a white male patient care worker was $32.53 while for the same job, an African-American female was giving an average starting hourly pay of $24.97, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The report also stated UC’s African-American workforce has shrunk by 37 percent since 1996.</p>\n<p>“A Black female patient care worker would need to work for 14 years to reach the starting pay of a white man,” the report states. “A Latina patient care worker would reach the starting wage of a white man after working for 13 years, and a Latina service worker would catch up to a white man’s starting wage after four years.”</p>\n<p>The report took data from UC employment records, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“They’re all coming in [for] starting positions, and women of color are just being paid less,” he said.</p>\n<p>The UC has not yet released a public statement in response to the vote or the report, but de Los Angeles said the UC placed conditions in its union contracts “which is why our workers are so upset today.”</p>\n<p>Those conditions include raising the retirement age, raising healthcare rates and holding wages constant.</p>\n<p>“We strongly disagreed with AFSCME’s decision to strike, which will negatively impact patients, students and the UC community,” said Claire Doan, UCOP director of media relations, in an email. “What the union demanded was a 6 percent annual wage increase, which we think is unfair to other UC employees – both represented and non-represented. This is twice what other UC employees have received.”</p>\n<p>Doan said that UCOP has decided to increase AFSCME employees’ wages by two percent for the upcoming fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“UC presented AFSCME leaders with what we believe to be a competitive final settlement proposal that included multi-year wage increases (3 percent annual for four years) along with excellent health and retirement benefits,” she said. “They chose to reject it without conducting vote among their members.”</p>\n<p>The workers’ healthcare premiums will be “brought in line” with the rest of UC’s represented and non-represented employees and the retirement benefits of current employees will remain unchanged while new workers will be offered a choice between a tradition pension or a 401(k)-style plan, according to Doan.</p>\n<p>The raises were stalled for more than a year due to “protracted negotiations,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Update: This article was updated to include information about the union’s upcoming strike. </i></p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from the UC labor relations team. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Idle Riot will be playing this Friday night, with Fencer opening for them at 9 p.m. The theme of the night is “Dilfs and Milfs,” so attendees are urged to dress up as their favorite “dilf/milf.” Both are rock bands; Idle Riot is based in Isla Vista, while Fencer will be coming up from L.A. to perform. The show will be held at 6610 Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>FIND MEANING IN GLEANING </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re like me, you’ve never heard the term gleaning before; gleaning is a term that means picking produce from harvest that would otherwise be unpicked and perish. Join Zero Waste Committee, FoodCycling and Environmental Affairs Board for their first gleaning event of the quarter this Saturday from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. They will be taking students to glean in the Montecito community. Carpooling will be arranged. Those interested can sign up at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/UCSBGleaning\">tinyurl.com/UCSBGleaning</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>HELP THE HOMELESS</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you need community service hours or just want to help out those around you, head to the El Dorado community lounge this Saturday morning at 9:30 a.m. The University Undergrad Apartments will be putting together care packages for houseless individuals. A light breakfast will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>HIKE TO THE SEVEN FALLS</strong></p>\n<p>Stretch your legs with Environmental Affairs Board on a hike to Seven Falls this Sunday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The trail is one of the easier hikes, spanning three miles and multiple waterfalls. Depending on conditions, there may even be a natural waterslide, WHAT????!!!! Organizers ask that those interested in participating fill out a short Google form that can be found on the event page. Go have fun!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>YA LIKE BRUNCH? YA LIKE YOGA?</strong></p>\n<p>Grab your yoga mat and head over to the Isla Vista Food Cooperative at 9:45 a.m. this Sunday for their monthly event, Beach Brunch Yoga. The event includes an hour-long yoga class on the bluffs overlooking the ocean followed by a light brunch. This month, the brunch will be set up as a “build a bowl” where participants can create an açai bowl with granola and superfood toppings. The brunch theme will vary each month of the year. Participants must pay a $5 fee at the Co-Op from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. any day before the event to sign up. Those who do not show up on time at 10 a.m. may lose their spot unless they call ahead of time.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily

Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises. <em>Irene Chen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Ramadan takes place during the ninth month of the Muslim year, in which some Muslims fast for 30 days from sunrise to sundown.</p>\n<p>The dining commons will give students the option of taking a maximum of two meals out of the dining commons per meal period. They will be given one three-compartment takeout box and one cup with a lid.</p>\n<p>Those who choose to take two meals will be given two boxes. “We wanted flexibility for people,” said Jill Horst, dining director of Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises.</p>\n<p>Horst said that setting the two-box limit took into consideration that many students may not have the space or resources to store large amounts of food.</p>\n<p>The program has been ongoing for several years, according to Horst.</p>\n<p>Since Ramadan begins at different times each year, the holiday had fallen on summer in some years, so the university did not always need to make any accommodations.</p>\n<p>Portola, De La Guerra and Carrillo dining commons will all offer the service.</p>\n<p>Horst said her staff chose those three dining commons because they are open seven days a week and span all geographical areas of campus.</p>\n<p>Ramadan is one of few holidays for which the university provides special accommodations.</p>\n<p>“During Passover we have a Passover table, but other than that I feel that we’re able to meet the needs of our student population through our regular service,” Horst said.</p>\n<p>Those fasting have been asked to provide their names prior to the start of the program.</p>\n<p>Horst said this is so they can prepare for the amount of students who will need the compartment boxes.</p>\n<p>The number of students using this program ranges from 10 to 20, Horst said.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday evening, she has received three requests for the accommodation, and she anticipates more students will contact her.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

members expressed skepticism about the program not having a permanent bike rack for students to park in. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The program, co-sponsored by the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), will allow individuals to borrow one of the 1,200 bicycles that will be available.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are approximately 20,000 registered bicycles within UCSB and I.V.’s two square miles, according to the Associated Students Bicycle Committee.</p>\n<p>Matt Dobberteen, alternative transport manager from the Santa Barbara Public Works department, presented the program to the I.V. CSD alongside Mo Lovegreen, UCSB director of campus sustainability, on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking at a potential launch date of June 25, 2018, for the first allocation of 600 bikes in the area,” Dobberteen said.</p>\n<p>Following the first launch date, an additional 600 bikes will arrive in August, he explained.</p>\n<p>Each bike has an individual GPS tracking unit and bike lock attached, according to Dobberteen. This eliminates the need for a bike rack and lowers the chances of theft.</p>\n<p>Currently, the I.V. CSD is trying to find parking spaces for the bicycles.</p>\n<p>Every CSD board member supported the program, but a few members expressed skepticism about the program not having a permanent bike rack for students to park in.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman questioned how students would be prevented from leaving the bikes piled up on the side of the street.</p>\n<p>Dobberteen said watching the flow of bikes and where they end up will be an important learning tool.</p>\n<p>“If there are heaps of bikes all over, we have failed,” he said.</p>\n<p>Dobberteen said potential solutions include giving students incentives to return bikes to a designated location in the evening or hiring a company that would park the bicycles in a designated location during the night.</p>\n<p>Lovegreen added that UCSB’s Department of Campus Sustainability also has plans to start a new outreach program for the bike sharing service starting next week. The program is directed at incoming freshmen in an attempt to persuade them to not bring their own bikes.</p>\n<p>The board of directors said the central problem with the program is finding the space for the bikes and persuading students to use the bikes in a respectful manner.</p>\n<p>“This is about us bringing high quality transportation to the community, and if we are respectful, it benefits everyone,” Dobberteen added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The student was running as an executive candidate in the spring A.S. election, according to the email.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> began to investigate the matter immediately but was unable to confirm which candidate the anonymous sender referred to.</p>\n<p>After the <em>Nexus</em> published its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/mayela-morales-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsement of Morales</a>, the editorial board began to receive other complaints about organizational conflicts during the student lobby visits. These complaints were from three anonymous sources that worked with Morales in preparation for these conferences.</p>\n<p>Morales was the internal director of Lobby Corps as well as a member of USSA, which organized both lobbying trips.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus</em> editorial board was aware of complaints against an executive candidate prior to writing the endorsement, we needed confirmation through evidence and documentation to retract our choice. Our endorsement of Morales was based on an extensive interview process and a discussion with the editorial board.</p>\n<p>Based on Morales’s interview and other involvement on campus, we do believe Morales is the right person for the position; however, our investigation into the lobbying trip conflicts has led us to retract our endorsement.</p>\n<p>According to documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>, Morales failed to communicate with a colleague about transportation to the Sacramento lobby visit. The failure to communicate with the colleague in a timely manner resulted in a failure to organize the transportation.</p>\n<p>Further documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em> on Tuesday, April 24, revealed Morales’s failure to complete the tasks she volunteered to do for a Washington, D.C. lobby visit, resulting in the untimely scheduling of flights and hotel accommodations.</p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the beginning of planning the conference, I informed the EVPSA that I was having problems with my phone because it had been in repairs for a minute. As I couldn’t afford to buy a new phone, I told everyone involved in planning the conference that I would be providing my support during my individual meetings with them, rather than over text,” </span>Morales told the <em>Nexus</em> in a statement.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since the beginning of 2018, due to some family financial issues, I haven’t had phone service which has made communication, at times, impossible. This is something every person I work with has been aware of since the beginning,” Morales added in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As colleagues and friends, the other people involved in the planning of the trips were aware of some of the mental health related issues I was personally going through at the time,” Morales also said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p>The editorial board believes it is best to formally retract the endorsement of Mayela Morales for the executive position. We apologize for our endorsement in light of this new information.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from Morales regarding her communication while organizing the lobby visits.  </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82722\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82722\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/","id":2281,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2280,2279,2278],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":59,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
