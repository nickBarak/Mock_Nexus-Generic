Ortega served two tours in Iraq, one tour in Afghanistan and is currently a helicopter crew chief stationed in Oahu, Hawaii. Ortega stepped into the national spotlight over the last year, advocating for transgender rights in the military.</p>\n<p>Ortega said the takeaway from the event should be to engage in more honest and difficult discussions about rights for marginalized groups.</p>\n<p>“Have tough conversations with people,” Ortega said. “That’s the most powerful thing you can do. They don’t have to be conversations where you attack or are in opposition, but you have to have tough, honest conversations with people.”</p>\n<p>Ortega said people have the responsibility to be involved in decision-making as conscientious voters.</p>\n<p>“We have to start the change with us,” Ortega said. “If you want there to be change … you need to get out there and vote.”</p>\n<p>According to Ortega, the Pentagon currently has a 12-person council led by Under Secretary of the Army Brad R. Carson to discuss transgender rights in the military. Ortega said the council’s decisions often correlate with the public’s opinion.</p>\n<p>“The decision about trans inclusion in the military is currently with a think tank led by Mr. Carson, the Under Secretary of the Department of the Army and 12 guys at the Pentagon with whom I correspond,” Ortega said.</p>\n<p>RCSGD director David Whitman said Ortega addressed important issues on which many students lack knowledge, such as the varying identities on a “gender spectrum.”</p>\n<p>“As a trans man and a trans masculine-presenting person, Ortega gave a lot of awareness to different identities within the gender spectrum,” Whitman said. “He talked about his journey as a trans person and what aspects of his life led to his ability to be himself and I think that was empowering.”</p>\n<p>Whitman said Ortega’s talk is also applicable to university students, though the talk focused on his experience in the military.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see UCSB students come together and prioritize diversity initiatives,” Whitman said. “There are endless communities and intersections in those communities that are very much at risk but are also very much deserving of our respect, love, attention … the more we lean into things we don’t know about … I think the healthier our communities will be.”</p>\n<p>Diversity Education Coordinator for RCSGD and third-year sociology major Khadeja Tran said the campus should increase the number of resources for transgender students.</p>\n<p>“There are also trans people on campus, a lot of them, who maybe aren’t out yet, who maybe are in between, who need the resources or help from faculty, staff and students to feel more included and for the campus environment to be more inclusive,” Tran said.</p>\n<p>Second-year music composition major Tino Jones said Ortega carried the conversation about transgender rights in the military into public focus.</p>\n<p>“Transgender appearance in the military is something that has been widely debated — whether or not [they] should be there,” Jones said. “Shane Ortega’s success is showing that you can do things even though someone may tell you that you can’t.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCPD works alongside IVFP to represent the university’s interest in matters of law and safety in I.V. while also patrolling the approximately 1,000 acres of UCSB’s campus, maintaining 24-hour uniformed patrol and police response.</p>\n<p>IVFP Sergeant Daniel Calderon said UCPD officers and IVFP deputies have similar duties and often rotate roles.</p>\n<p>“We all have the same peace officers powers of the state,” Calderon said. “It is just that those officers that are assigned to the campus only work on the campus during that time period. Isla Vista, this particular community, is an unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County, so [IVFP] handles all of the emergency calls for service.”</p>\n<p>There are currently seven officers from UCPD both patrolling campus and working in I.V. alongside IVFP, according to UCPD Sergeant Robert Romero.</p>\n<p>“That is on a rotational basis, so once every year and a half, two years, an officer will leave the campus patrol station and go work eight months to a year out at Isla Vista,” Romero said. “They are the ones that are really the heart and soul of the department.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP responds to crimes such as burglary, theft, battery and assault, but not traffic accidents, which fall under the California Highway Patrol’s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>“We don’t handle the traffic enforcement out here — that is still Highway Patrol — they’re still responsible for handling traffic accident investigations, things like that,” Calderon said. “But we can still pull people over — issue citations for speeding, stop signs we can still make arrests for drunk driving and things like that — it is just that that is not necessarily our primary duty.”</p>\n<p>UCPD’s campus jurisdiction includes lecture halls and university housing in I.V., according to Calderon.</p>\n<p>“All of the buildings that they own that surround Isla Vista, all of the student housing, the faculty housing and [family] student housing, all of the new construction projects that you see — that is all UC property,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD hosts safety presentations for students, especially those living in residence halls, and collaborates with them on solutions to solve public safety issues.</p>\n<p>“We go to different functions that residential life might be putting on,” Romero said. “These interactions we have with students is, basically, we talk to them about things on how to be safe and they talk to us about what they like, what they don’t like from their police department. So it is an exchange of ideas and how to come up with a better plan on how to keep the community safe.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said any student or I.V. resident can join IVFP deputies on a walk-along to experience a day in the life of an officer.</p>\n<p>“From a UCSB student’s perspective, there is just a bunch of cops walking around. Do you know what they are doing?” Calderon said. “That is why I encourage people to do walk-alongs so they can kind of see and point out the problems that we try to tell people about.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, IVFP deputies are trained to use “tactical communication” skills when dealing with “chaotic” scenarios.</p>\n<p>“Let’s say I’m working Del Playa on a Saturday night. It’s really busy and if I went into a party or I went into a fight and people are yelling and it’s a very chaotic, rapidly evolving scene, it is not going to benefit me and it’s not going to benefit my partners if I go in there and start yelling at people,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said newly hired UCPD officers undergo field training alongside an experienced officer.</p>\n<p>“When they get hired they are on a field training program,” Romero said. “Besides learning how to do a proper car stop, how to search somebody properly, how to place somebody into custody, we also teach them how to interact with our community, things to look for, how to be an active listener.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP intervenes when necessary to keep students and I.V. residents safe.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to make sure that everybody enjoys their time here out in Isla Vista and we know that they are away from home and a lot of people are away from home for the first time,” Calderon said. “It is not our greatest goal just to write people tickets for open containers of alcohol.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, deputies prosecute people for wrong-doings to prevent them from repeatedly acting out.</p>\n<p>“We try to prosecute that person because what we found is that when people do that to somebody — when they harm them physically, sexually assault them, that kind of thing — that almost empowers them to where they think that they can do it again and keep doing it in our community,” Calderon said. “That is why we have these people who are repeat offenders.”</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD looks to hire officers who are community oriented.</p>\n<p>“We try to hire people here at the police department that are customer service oriented, community oriented. And when we are doing the hiring process, even some of the interview questions for getting a job here at the police department, we ask them about how do you feel about community-organized policing, can you define it for us, what does it mean to you?” Romero said.</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP seeks to hire “mature” and experienced individuals as deputies.</p>\n<p>“I started this business when I was little bit older, I had already had another career completely. I started this in 2002; I came on board with the Sheriff’s office but I had already done some other things,” Calderon said. “Essentially we want to make sure that the officers and deputies assigned here are mature.”</p>\n<p>Romero said Community Service Organization (CSO) student officers also work alongside UCPD and help with campus security, patrolling campus buildings, sports games and entertainment events.</p>\n<p>“They do a fabulous job of going into the community, because their peers are the students,” Romero said. “They also are an extra pair of eyes and ears for any trouble that is going on in the university campus or Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Romero said the number of officers at the UCPD station, which includes an investigation unit and dispatch center, will likely soon increase.</p>\n<p>“Currently we have 36 sworn police officers, however, that number is going to grow probably another 10 here in the near future,” Romero said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Mable Truong said she did not know the difference between IVFP and UCPD, and previously was not aware of the CSO program.</p>\n<p>“I would be one of the people that are confused,” Truong said. “I think I have an idea of what they do — they are the people that bring you around at night … then I just saw them last night so I thought that was really cool, and they seem really friendly, too.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Elizabeth Del Rincon said she feels safer on campus and in I.V. with a visible police presence.</p>\n<p>“Just if something bad were to happen, I feel like they would be there to go and help,” Del Rincon said.</p>\n<p>Del Rincon said she believes it is important for officers to receive training on how to work with students.</p>\n<p>“They are around students all the time so I feel like if they were to receive training it would be better,” Del Rincon said. “I see them especially at night escorting people to their dorms and stuff and I think that is really good.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Jill Allen said the CSO escort program is helpful and allows students to feel safer.</p>\n<p>“It makes you feel safer trying to walk from one end, especially to walk from the Chem building to I.V. in the dark. It’s not so fun,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, UCPD and IVFP work together without overstepping boundaries.</p>\n<p>“It is two different jurisdictions, but in other words, we work very closely. We don’t step on each other’s toes,” Calderon said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

The demonstration was successful in gaining cooperation from UCSB administrators. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Five months after students gathered for a 13-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office to present 13 demands regarding campus sexual assault policy, administrators are continuing to collaborate with students on various improvements to support survivors and punish perpetrators.</p>\n<p>The May sit-in led by student group #NowUCSB, formerly “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You,” resulted in Yang agreeing to consider a list of 13 demands, including stricter punishments for offenders, improved sensitivity training for faculty and staff and greater diversity among on-campus aid groups and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP). The farthest-reaching policy change from the demands is a UC-wide requirement in June for all faculty and staff to undergo sexual violence and consent training. Other changes include increased sexual assault training for IVFP deputies and advertising for the Sexual Assault Survivor Fund on campus, which provides financial support to survivors to cover immediate expenses.</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB leader and third-year Chican@ studies major Alejandra Melgoza said while an estimated 95 percent of the demands are in progress, the bureaucracy involved with certain demands has caused delayed implementation.</p>\n<p>“So many survivors for so many years have been waiting for these changes to happen, and, right now, we have policy demands that we have to make happen,” Melgoza said. “Because of all the red tape we have to go through, it will take a long time.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said while the support of students and staff pressured the administration to make changes, ongoing education is still necessary to the movement’s success.</p>\n<p>“I have been very grateful for the support from Associated Students, faculty, staff, grad students and workers across the campus,” Melgoza said. “It has made an impact, and people are aware of it, but it’s very important to highlight to the new incoming class. They need to know what happened last year so that they can support it.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said with the start of the new academic year, more students will become involved in the campaign.</p>\n<p>“There has been progress on many of the thirteen demands, though we have been waiting for students to return to get their feedback and involvement in several of the demand areas,” Fleming said in an email. “I am hoping to see a diverse group of students established with whom staff and administrators can meet on a regular, perhaps monthly, basis to discuss issues of sexual and interpersonal violence.”</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB’s first three demands, which request students found guilty of sexual assault be immediately suspended for a minimum of four quarters and removed from campus, have to be approved by UC Office of the President. According to Fleming, the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault will soon release updated UC-wide policies.</p>\n<p>“There is a system-wide committee that is part of President Napolitano’s Taskforce on Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault that is about to issue new UC adjudication and sanctioning guidelines, so the Office of Judicial Affairs is waiting for these guidelines to inform any changes related to adjudication of sexual assault cases and disciplinary sanctions,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>UConsent coordinator, Take Back the Night co-chair and fourth-year global and feminist studies double-major Ashley Morgan said the University is “dragging their feet” in addressing students’ demands for improved sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think anyone is surprised that the university has delayed putting the demands into effect, given their history of handling cases of sexual assault and their initial resistance to these ideas,” Morgan said in an email.</p>\n<p>Morgan said she is hopeful the demands will soon be implemented.</p>\n<p>“I think [administrators] are beginning to realize that by helping this forward, they are paving the way for the UCs in terms of sexual assault reform,” Morgan said in an email. “I’m hoping that this notion, along with constant pressure from those involved, will get these demands implemented within this school year.”<br>\nAccording to Melgoza, there is still a long way to go before survivors of sexual assault receive sufficient support from the University.</p>\n<p>“These are the lives of students; their power was taken away,” Melgoza said. “It’s important to acknowledge that fact and make sure those survivors are given that power again.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clinic Tuesday night hosted by Assemblymember Das Williams’s office to discuss self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Attendees addressed the parking meeting held Monday night, hosted by Santa Barbara County in conjunction with Planning and Public Work staff. Stakeholders scheduled specific topics to be discussed at the following meeting through mid-February.</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident and business owner Jay Freeman said he did not like the presentation-oriented structure of the parking meeting. According to Freeman, attendees contested the results of a previous parking survey which found a 15 percent increase in parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was all a power-point presentation format and we all had only three minutes to say what we didn’t like about the parking study,” Freeman said. “Essentially everyone made the argument, ‘well we don’t have any parking spaces even though you found 15 percent parking.’”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdoc said she is concerned about UCSB’s involvement in the suggested parking permit program, and is suspicious the University will push students to pay for campus lots.</p>\n<p>“I feel they have another objective,” Murdoc said. “They want people to pay in their lots or want to make parking expensive enough in Isla Vista that people will use their lots. That concerns me.”</p>\n<p>Field Representative from Williams’ office and UCSB alumnus Cameron Schunk said the SB County Sheriff’s Department will not be responsible for enforcing parking permits in I.V.</p>\n<p>“In our most recent conversation, the Sheriff was not willing to be responsible for the enforcement of a parking permit program in Isla Vista,” Schunk said. “Basically saying we don’t have enough manpower to do it without paying them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65048\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65048\" data-attachment-id=\"65048\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-07/stakeholders-revisit-i-v-self-governance/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444157215\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"140\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65048\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-65048\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Community Organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said issues concerning parking services are complicated.</p>\n<p>“There’s so many different directions we could go with this,” Elliott said. “There’s so many parts of it. There’s permit ideas, parking structures, parking restrictions, coastal access. Everyone has their own vision of what a parking program will look like in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Elliott said she wants to create a subcommittee to tackle issues specific to parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It needs to be a diverse group of people with different representations of various demographics in I.V.,” Elliott said. “The parking program could affect everyone in different ways.”</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, the subcommittee would create a proposal for an I.V. parking program to present to the California Coastal Commission and the community for feedback.</p>\n<p>“They would then present it at a meeting with the Coastal Commission and the community,” Elliott said. “They will be there to give us feedback on the proposal.”</p>\n<p>Elliott also said some I.V. residents are disappointed the recently appointed Community Resource Deputy (CRD), James McKarrel, is monolingual.</p>\n<p>“They said he wouldn’t be able to reach out to Latino communities and that’s part of what the community resource deputy is supposed to do,” Elliott said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65047\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65047\" data-attachment-id=\"65047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-07/stakeholders-revisit-i-v-self-governance/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444156197\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"160\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Lorenzo Basilio-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65047\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-65047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Schunk said there are limited options when hiring a CRD, as the S.B.

F&amp;B) met Oct. 5th in the UCen State Street room to consider 14 funding requests from 12 campus organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee began its meeting with $57,198.05 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $8,665.26 in senate unallocated, $45,0000 in Student Initiated Outreach Program, $45,000 in culture weeks and graduations, $30,0000 for sports teams and $17,164 for academic teams. The committee fully granted six requests, partially granted six requests and tabled two requests.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi requested $656 for a campus event and $2,300 to send five members to the Leadership and Excellence Academies for Deltasigs in New Mexico.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi member Austin Kang said the group’s first request was for an Oct. 23 event to educate UCSB students about the nonprofit organization Liberty in North Korea, which helps North Koreans escape to other countries.</p>\n<p>“We are hopeful that [this event] will bring awareness about the condition and the situations that people in North Korea live in,” Kang said. “There is going to be at least one refugee that will speak.”</p>\n<p>The committee fully funded the group $656 but tabled its request for $2,300 to the Oct. 12 meeting.</p>\n<p>KCSB representative Matt Merritt requested $2,000 for Hello World!, a music festival on Oct. 10 in Anisq’Oyo’ Park that will feature Scientist, The Lions and Cornerstone.</p>\n<p>“We are bringing these groups, musical groups, from all around the world to come and perform,” Merritt said. “We are educating the community on these groups and their cultures. And then also educational in the sense that we are bringing members of our own community in one place to appreciate and discover each other’s culture.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund KCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB League of Legends (L.o.L.) treasurer Elaine Hu and public relations chair Albert Chen requested $80 for a gaming event Oct. 11at the Loma Pelona Center.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund UCSB L.o.L.</p>\n<p>Swing and Ballroom Dance Club co-treasurer Cecilia Gutierrez and president Steve Carlan requested $2,594 for a free swing dance event Oct. 24 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $1,460 for a band, refreshments and Community Service Officers (CSO’s) at the event.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club treasurer Alex Vera and vice president Samuel Anspach requested $2,921 for the club’s annual dance competition, Beach Ball.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $2,120 to hire professional dancers for the event.</p>\n<p>Transfer Student Alliance requested for $426 for their first general meeting on Oct. 14 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the group for its upcoming event.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year political science major José Magaña requested $2,474 from senate unallocated funds for condom dispensers to place in bathrooms around campus.</p>\n<p>CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major Dustin Larrazolo said the committee should fund Magaña’s project, because it fully granted KCSB’s request.</p>\n<p>“Safe sex is more important than a broadcasting radio station’s event,” Larrazolo said.</p>\n<p>Kevin Koo recommended Magaña request funds through a campus organization in order to access OSL funds as opposed to senate unallocated.</p>\n<p>“He is working with other student groups and OSL groups,” Koo said. “He could just come in next week.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to table Magaña’s request until its Oct. 12 meeting, suggesting he seek other funding options throughout the week.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B then voted to fund Lindy Circle $2,000 out of its first request of $2,743, as well as $520 of its second request of $580.</p>\n<p>Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) member Charles Jones requested $7,995 for its annual, three-day Greeks 4 Kids fundraising event, which includes a carnival, dodgeball tournament and dance-off.</p>\n<p>The committee funded ATO $6,595, including $3,200 to rent Campbell Hall for the dance-off.</p>\n<p>Professor of sociology John Foran requested $1,006 on behalf of System Change Not Climate Change for the group’s upcoming conference, 21st Century Ecosocialism: Practicing System Change, Making Connections, Building a Movement, which will take place Oct. 9 through Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>Foran said the conference is an opportunity to educate students who are not taking classes about environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“Certainly this is something that should be of great interest to our students in a number of other classes on campus,” Foran said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund System Change Not Climate Change.</p>\n<p>The committee then voted to grant UCSB Students for Bernie Sanders the $175 it requested for a Democratic presidential debate viewing event Oct. 13 in the Hub and to grant BSU the $590 it requested.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article did not include the entirety of Larrazolo’s quote and misnamed his majors.

Speakers shared their experiences coming out during the initial portion of the event, followed by an open mic for attendees to share their own stories.</p>\n<p>Third-year history major William Roberts said the event communicated the “diversity of experiences” people have when coming out.</p>\n<p>“Revealing [coming out] as not to be the one-time event … but as a complex, sometimes difficult, but ultimately beautiful and liberating experience felt differently by all queer and trans people,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major Jean Mack, whose name has been changed, said she has a “split lifestyle” because she has not come out as bisexual in her hometown in Northern California but is involved with many LGBTQ events at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s very freeing to be in a community where you can be your whole self,” Mack said. “I think for many people, especially coming in as freshmen, it’s their first experience where they can be around queer people.”</p>\n<p>Mack said she was comfortable speaking at the “Coming Out Monologues” because organizers reached out to a wide range of identities when advertising the event.</p>\n<p>“I think a very subtle thing … which I hope they continue doing, is putting all sorts of identities on the poster itself for the event,” Mack said. “[It] was a big deal for me because, as a bisexual woman, I often feel like I’m not straight enough for straight places and I’m not queer enough for gay spaces so it’s this weird in-between.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Shelley Alvarez, whose name and year have been changed, said being queer at UCSB is “a lot less alienating” than she expected, but finding spaces for everyday interactions is still difficult.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the settings in which people congregate to are very sexual in nature, or they involve a lot of drinking and hook-ups and sometimes you just want to find a group of people to hang out with and have fun with,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>According to RCGSD Graduate Assistant and Ph.D. candidate Alex Kulick, LGBTQ communities and resources on campus and in I.V. need to be made more apparent to students.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the big issues that I’ve noticed really is a lack of visibility,” Kulick said. “There’s certainly a lot of spaces, especially in Isla Vista, that are not necessarily visibly queer or don’t have any visible presence of queer-friendly spaces.”</p>\n<p>Kulick said it was his first time attending the “Coming Out Monologues.”</p>\n<p>“I was just really, really impressed by the courage of the students and the vulnerability that they were able to share, and also, I think the diversity of the experiences that were showcased along different lines of gender, race, ethnicity, class and, of course, all types of different other experiences that people come from.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Last October, law enforcement personnel assigned to work Halloween weekend in I.V. included UCPD officers from UCSB and other UC campuses, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office deputies, California Highway Patrol and Ventura County Sheriff’s Office, as well investigators from local law enforcement agencies and the Sheriff’s Mounted unit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa said a noise ordinance will be in effect beginning at 6 p.m. during Halloween weekend, largely due to the behavior of out of town visitors who come to I.V. to celebrate the holiday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s more reactionary to people who are from out of town walking in public making noise or resident’s blasting music towards the street than it is to private house parties,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said he hopes the number of people coming to I.V. for Halloween continues to decrease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween and Deltopia have certainly died down in the recent years,” said Signa. “We would like to keep it that way for the safety of our neighbors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD Officer Jon Reyes said I.V. residents should take normal precautions to protect their residencies and vehicles over Halloween weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lock your house and car doors,” Reyes said. “Secure your belongings. We deal with a lot of preventable burglaries.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College of Letters and Science Senator and third-year history of public policy major  Ashcon Minoiefar helped organize the event and said Pizza with Police has been very successful. UCPD and A.S. will be hosting the event every other week in October with a follow-up event after Halloween, according to Minoiefar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pizza with Police went very well,” Minoiefar said in an email. “Since Lt. Mark Signa and I started the event last Halloween, it has consistently brought in 100-200 attendees every time.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minoiefar said Pizza with Police “gets students interested” in public safety and could encourage them to volunteer for community policing programs such as UCIV which is active during Halloween and Deltopia weekends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Creating a culture of community policing and community involvement in public safety, is the first step to moving away from harsh enforcement and high rates of tickets,” Minoiefar said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year biology major Manu Chopra said his interactions with officers at the event caused him to see

three-floor residence for visiting scholar physicists located adjacent to the San Clemente Villages, scheduled to open late next year.</p>\n<p>American businessman and philanthropist Charlie Munger donated $65 million to be used for constructing the Visiting Scholars Residence, a 75,000-square-foot building located on El Colegio Road west of San Clemente apartments. The Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP includes meeting rooms, shared kitchens, dining rooms, a gym and 61 apartment style, fully-furnished private bedrooms with private bathrooms. The residence will also house a flag hall to display national flags of current visiting scholars. Construction began October 2014 and the Visiting Scholars Residence is planned to open late 2016. KITP is a research facility created in 1979 which hosts programs such as Deconstructing the Sense of Smell and Dynamics and Evolution of Earth-like Planets.</p>\n<p>KITP residence manager James Brill said he currently collaborates with visiting scholars to coordinate housing in Isla Vista and Santa Barbara. According to Brill, he contributed to the layout design of the Visiting Scholars Residence and attributes the success of the construction to Munger’s donation.</p>\n<p>“We had a very informal rental program … so as a result, years ago, they really thought about making some sort of residence,” Brill said. “Then, as we kept adding more and more scientists, it became a definite need, and then just last year Charlie Munger decided to give us a very, very generous grant to build the residence.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the residence will accommodate visiting scholars at UCSB as well as their families.</p>\n<p>“We’ve designed a lot of the rooms to be family friendly — we have like a child’s play room and we want to make sure nothing is stopping you from coming and being as productive as you can possibly be while you’re here,” Brill said.</p>\n<p>According to Brill, the meeting rooms allow visiting physicists to interact off-campus and to conduct their work in their living setting.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got everyone working on a program, you’re all together, which is something the physicists really wanted,” Brill said. “It’s really nice that you can do a lot of intensive work no matter where you are.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the exterior of the Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP is meant to resemble Santa Barbara architecture.</p>\n<p>“Because we have such a big international group, we tried to tie it into the construction that we have in Santa Barbara … we want it to fit into the aesthetic of the neighborhood,” Brill said. “The main goal of KITP is to get people from all parts of the world to get together.”</p>\n<p>Director of KITP and professor of astrophysics and cosmology Lars Bildsten said KITP hosts programs year round to “capture frontier topics” and provide a venue for open discussions.</p>\n<p>“The major thing that the KITP provides for the university is a huge flock of physicists that come for long periods and interact mostly with each other, but most of our activities are open to the campus,” Bildsten said. “So we get a lot of physics graduates students, mathematical graduate students, biology students who come and interact with the visitors.”</p>\n<p>UCSB professor of biophysics and KITP permanent member Boris Shraiman said KITP is a “fantastic” place physicists can visit to be inspired.</p>\n<p>“[The] new residence will allow our physicists to stay together and keep working and thinking about science 24/7,” Shraiman said. “It will become immediately an attraction and I expect to go there in the evening to hang out with the scientists.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It’s nice to have a new apartment and not have to share a shower with more than one person,” Tang said in an email. “I lived in Santa Ynez before and it definitely a lot nicer [here], especially the new appliances, also there’s a lot less ants.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Allie Lobos said she chose to live at Sierra Madre and though the new apartments are clean, she dislikes the 1.8 mile commute to campus.</p>\n<p>“Living here is great. It’s new, it’s clean, but I wish I did live in Isla Vista,” Lobos said. “My biggest complaint is the distance; I have three 8 a.m.s a week.”</p>\n<p>Tang said despite the distance, he would be willing to choose to live in Sierra Madre Village Apartments again.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of far and taking the bus can be annoying when I miss it and become late for class, but I like it a lot and would choose to live here again,” Tang said again, in an email.</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major and transfer student Vanessa Guevara said she likes living farther from campus and closer to the supermarkets, and she is looking forward to the completion of the convenience store and recreational building.</p>\n<p>“I like how far it is; it feels more secluded from the main campus and it’s close to groceries,” Guevara said in an email. “I hope the store and gym opens soon though. I bike so it’s not really a problem and the living space is nice especially since it was just built.”</p>\n<p>Project Executive Joe Linden said the administration and recreation building will be completed in two to three weeks’ time, and until then students will be surrounded in a loud environment. Linden also said the faculty building which burned down July 4, 2014 is nearing completion.</p>\n<p>“Everything is on schedule but some community buildings still have about two weeks left,” Linden said. “Building seven which is located by Whittier and Storke Road has two to three weeks left as well.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64949\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64949\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/","id":2705,"author":{"id":144,"name":"Jonathan Mendez"},"related":[2704,2703,2702],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double major Nawar Nemeh presented five bills written by himself and off-campus senator and third-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik regarding future A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa said the department is currently discussing events as alternatives to the I.V. party scene during Halloween and the option of assigning fewer law enforcement officers to the community than were present last year.</p>\n<p>“As we’ve done in the past year, there has been a good reduction of people during Halloween,” Signa said. “The general plan is focusing hard on putting together concerts on campus that draw students on campus to sober events. The goal is to start reducing the number of officers. We want to have Halloween known not as an outsider event but a local event for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh presented “A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a Single Transferable Vote System.” Nemeh said a single transferable vote system, which aims to establish proportional representation by allowing voters to rank candidates, could improve voter representation in A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“This process ensures that votes are not wasted,” Nemeh said. “We want to have a multi-party system.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh then presented and “A Bill to Update Article XIX Section 2 of the Associated Students Legal Code,” which outlines a new process by which new political parties register through the Office of Student Life (OSL).</p>\n<p>Nemeh said parties should register as campus political organizations through OSL because they are active year round.</p>\n<p>“The Elections Code assumes parties aren’t active outside of week four of winter through week six of spring quarters, which is certainly not true,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh also said political parties registered as campus organizations through OSL would receive an advisor to help them “organize politically” throughout the year.</p>\n<p>“Students who feel unsafe or stressed out or lost will have an advisor as a resource for this party,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh then presented “A Bill to Update Article XIX Section 4 of the Associated Students Legal Code,” which outlines A.S. campaign regulations such as procedures for candidate forums.</p>\n<p>Senate tabled the five bills until its following meeting

2015-2016 school year to facilitate conversations with anyone interested.</p>\n<p>Calvaletto began regularly talking with students, faculty and campus visitors last fall, standing at the booth from either 9 a.m. or noon until 3 p.m. He aims to connect with the younger generation through conversation and is willing to chat with anyone about any topic or question.</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said although the advice and conversations are free, he accepts donations to support mission trips.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about the money so I always have a sign that it’s free,” Calvaletto said. “My children were missionaries in Africa, they’ve now returned to the States, but I plan to use it to help some other types of missions somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said his main goal is to “make a difference” and encourage the younger generation to make smart decisions.</p>\n<p>“I see culture changing faster than I ever imagined,” Calvaletto said. “So my goal is to one by one encourage students to do what they feel is right.”</p>\n<p>According to Calvaletto, the most important advice he has to offer was given to him by an upperclassman when he attended California Maritime Academy.</p>\n<p>“After a week I wanted to quit,” Calvaletto said. “And an upperclassmen came alongside me and said, ‘You can quit if you want, but you’re not getting back any of your money.’ What I suggest is just stay for this semester and if at the end of this semester if you decide to quit you can quit then.”</p>\n<p>Office of Student Life Dean of Student Life &amp; Activities Katya Armistead said she approved his booth to be on campus and has received nothing but positive comments about Calvaletto.<br>\n“He’s a colorful fellow; I see students really enjoy talking with him,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>According to Calvaletto, his questions and conversations usually revolve around relationships.</p>\n<p>“What does that tell you about mankind? We were designed for relationships,” Calvaletto said. “People are hurting because of broken relationships — I can only tell them it takes time to heal some of these things.”</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said although he identifies as a conservative Catholic, he is not here to argue his beliefs, despite rumours on social media sites like Reddit.</p>\n<p>“I’m open and honest talking about a relationship with God,” Calvaletto said. “I’m not here to argue; I’m here to be a light and I do believe God loves all these students but it’s not about a religion, it’s about a relationship.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said she was fine with him conversing with students so long as he does not provide academic counseling.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern wasn’t in terms of what his opinion was; it was that he wasn’t trying to provide anything that was university business,” Armistead said.<br>\nThird-year economics major Christopher Wong said Calvaletto has a lot to offer students on campus.</p>\n<p>“He’s cool, just doing his thing, posting at the corner with his 5 cents sign, probably the most productive 5 cents you can give somebody,” Wong said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the

Food Bank and COSWB will provide services at the event.</p>\n<p>“A.S Food Bank’s table that will be hosting a food distribution, as well as UCSB’s COSWB will be there providing free yoga to carnival-goers,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>Hanna said IVCRC will reward game participants at the carnival with “Pardollas,” which they redeem at I.V. restaurants on the day of the event.</p>\n<p>“If people participate in any of the free games we have going on, they will receive Pardollas in which they can use in restaurants that are participating to score deals on free food,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>According to IVCRC publicity manager and third-year global studies major Lauren Lim, the carnival will feature free activities music from KCSB-FM.</p>\n<p>“We really want to emphasize that there will be tons of free giveaways and games to participate in,” Lim said. “I’m really excited about KCSB attending and providing cool DJ sets for people to listen to while they’re there as well.”</p>\n<p>Lim said IVCRC expects a large turnout at the carnival.</p>\n<p>“We have over 1,000 people that have RSVPed on the Facebook event, but we are anticipating way more than that to attend on the day of,” Lim said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/","id":2704,"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki"},"related":[2703,2702,2701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

F&amp;B) met for their first meeting of Fall Quarter on Monday in the UCen State Street Room.</p>\n<p>The Committee heard from six student organizations including Students for Life of America, Laughology, Mab Productions, UCSB Model United Nations (MUN), Sketch ‘N’ Sniff and the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC). A.S. F&amp;B fully funded Students for Life of America and partially funded the other five student groups.</p>\n<p>IFC Vice President of Communications Austin Hechler requested $15,000 to bring RL Grime to the Thunderdome on Nov. 10 for a benefit concert to raise funds to improve Greek Park.</p>\n<p>“If you have seen the park recently it is really run down with basketball courts that have cracks all over it, volleyball courts with weeds going everywhere,” Hechler said. “All fraternities and sororities will be represented in this park and this park is not just exclusively for Greeks; anyone who wants to host an event there can host an event there. We just want to make sure that it looks aesthetically good.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted IFC $10,000 for stage and lighting expenses and tabled the remaining $5,000, asking Hechler to return the following week to answer further questions.</p>\n<p>A representative of Students for Life of America said the group will use the $500 allocated for venue and security fees for a debate on abortion they plan to host on Oct. 21 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p>“We are hopefully going to have a philosophical debate about abortion,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>Board member Nawar Nemeh said he is concerned only one side of the debate is advertising for the event.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it will be a problem, but we should keep in mind that the advertising is being done by one side of the issue and it is a philosophical debate on a controversial issue,” Nemeh said. “I don’t know if we can fund, like, an independent entity and can advertise for them.”</p>\n<p>But A.S. F&amp;B Assistant Director for Finance and Budgets Cindy Lopez said, the Committee should not consider the content of the group’s event when deciding whether or not to fund it.</p>\n<p>“Any decision you make on funding for any event has to be content-neutral so we don’t make decisions on what the content is of any speaker that comes here,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Laughology President Matthew Ducket requested funding for this year’s performances including regular Saturday night shows, a possible live broadcast from Jake and Amir from College Humor and a show with comedian Moshe Kasher who appeared on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon”<em>, </em>“Conan” and “@midnight.”</p>\n<p>“We put on a free show every Saturday at 8 at Embarcadero Hall,” Ducket said. “We do that every Saturday with the exception of during Thanksgiving, dead week and finals week.”</p>\n<p>According to Ducket, A.S. has funded Laughology in previous years.</p>\n<p>“A.S. has kind of been the backbone for us, at least for the past four years that I have been part of this club,” Ducket said. “We typically get the majority of our funding from you guys and it really helps us to put on not just our shows in general but put on great shows.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted Laughology $1,120 of the requested $1,570.</p>\n<p>A Mab Productions representative requested $2,500 for its 25th Annual Monologue Festival, which will take place the first or second weekend of Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“The Monologue Festival comprises a series of monologues that are written by UCSB students, performed by UCSB students and are acted by UCSB students from majors all across campus,” the representative said. “I personally directed a monologue that was written by a thermodynamics student and acted by one of the Bachelor of Fine Arts students from the Department of Theater and Dance, being an English major myself.”</p>\n<p>The representative said Mab wants to expand its reach beyond campus and the requested money would fund advertising throughout Santa Barbara in publications such as the <em>Independent</em>.</p>\n<p>“We are asking for slightly more funding for advertising to explore some things like putting an ad in the newspaper or possibly on the radio,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>Chief Financial Officer Kevin Koo said he did not want the Committee to fund high advertising costs that do not target UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“I do a lot of work in advertising and I just think this number is not very feasible,” Koo said. “I would like to see that cost lower.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted Mab $1,500 of the requested $2,500 and advised the group to advertise in the <em>Daily Nexus</em> and <em>The Bottom Line. </em></p>\n<p>“I understand how you want to build a big audience group, but I kind of want to put students first in this opinion,” Koo said.</p>\n<p>UCSB MUN Under-Secretary-General of External Affairs Akshaya Natarajan requested $4,465 to take 12 delegates to the TrojanMUN Conference Oct. 29 through Nov. 1 at the University of Southern California.</p>\n<p>“We are an academic travel team and competitive team that goes to conferences and hosts our own conferences here on campus that simulates the United Nations,” Natarajan said. “We do a lot of this primarily around debate, research, public speaking, things like that.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted UCSB MUN $2,836 of the requested $4,469.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B also allocated the improvisation group Sketch ‘N’ Sniff $1,300 of the requested $1,900 for ads and facility fees.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64924\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64924\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/a-s-helps-to-fund-six-student-organizations/","id":2703,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2702,2701,2700],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Wage Increase Excludes Student Workers, Part-Time Employees","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Napolitano.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Napolitano.jpg?resize=605%2C328&ssl=1","description":"UC student workers and part-time employees are criticizing UC President Janet Napolitano’s recently announced plan to increase minimum wage for UC employees, claiming the plan is not inclusive of em...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC student workers and part-time employees are criticizing UC President Janet Napolitano’s recently announced plan to increase minimum wage for UC employees, claiming the plan is not inclusive of employees working less than 20 hours a week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Fair Wage/Fair Work Plan, which Napolitano announced at the July UC Board of Regents meeting, will raise the minimum wage by $1 per year for direct and service contract UC employees to $15 an hour over the next three years. Companies which provide services to the UC through contracting will also be required to comply with the new minimum wage policies. According to a UCOP press release, the cost of the wage increases will be covered by “non-core funds” such as bookstores and food services, which are separate from “core fund” revenue sources, which include tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fifth-year sociology major Alberto Perez said the plan benefits full-time UC and UC contract workers, but excludes student workers who typically only work 20 hours per week at most while attempting to provide for tuition and living costs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For student workers, the UC has had this kind of unspoken rule that suggests students don’t work over 20 hours because it might cut into their schoolwork and education, which makes sense in most cases,” Perez said. “However, you have … students that need to work at least 20 hours to be in school in the first place.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Perez, the limitations of the new minimum wage hike and exclusion of certain employees have been overlooked in favor of “positive press” for the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So their motivation is trying to be the beacon of light,” Perez said. “The one minor detail that nobody really covered is that many employees are left out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President of the UC Student-Workers Union (UAW 2865) and graduate student at UC Santa Cruz Robert Cavooris said the UC has good intentions with the minimum wage increase, but the exclusion of many part-time workers is questionable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC trying to encourage workers with this increase is laudable, but the way they are doing it doesn’t really seem to show that they care about all of their workers,” Cavooris said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cavooris, the limitations of the plan are difficult to amend because UC Office of the President (UCOP) is directly in charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know that there are any specific union actions planned, however, we know that when people are together and working together, workers are in a better position to have more power,” Cavooris said. “So this is the best thing we can do to ensure that people get a fair wage and we have power as workers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cavooris said unionization will be critical to ensuring worker benefits for all UC employees as the plan develops further. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a totally top-down initiative on one level … it also is related to a more general climate of work connectivity across the country which includes the fight for $15 an hour in many industries,” Cavooris said. “We’re organizing ourselves to make sure we can continue to push for things like this in the future, while making sure this doesn’t just apply to a few workers again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year electrical engineering major Himangshu Chowdhury said he thinks the announcement is a step in the right direction, and he hopes more wage increases will follow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just don’t think UC has the budget to universally increase wages for every worker at the moment,” Chowdhury said. “Hopefully, as they revise their budget, student workers will see more benefits follow in the near future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Perez, the UC would rather hire more workers with fewer hours than take on the costs of an increased minimum wage for part-time employees. Perez also said the wage increase affects him as a part-time employee at Portola dining commons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students never will see the $13 hours, and on top of that students will have less to work with, so that’s the concern that I have … a lot students like myself that have to work at least 20 hours to get by,” Perez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez said if the UC aims to cut costs and students lose the freedom to increase hours, productivity and morale will decrease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Things come up for students, and they will want to have the flexibility to work more … if they can’t, they might quit, causing management to hire more people which we have to train, and thus productivity goes down in general,” Perez said. “Ultimately, I just feel the UCOP put this policy out there without thinking what it means for certain people.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64879\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64879\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/","id":2700,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2699,2698,2697],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":113,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
