Some noted that they had not originally planned to speak but became convinced to after seeing others do the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many speakers urged for allyship from non-Black communities and emphasized the need for people in a position of privilege to self-educate about the Black community’s struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black people are everywhere and deserve to feel safe everywhere,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers expressed discontent with the Black student experience at UCSB, noting a lack of resources and a small population of Black students, </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently at 5%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the undergraduate student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walk in I.V. and see what it feels like to have everybody staring at you for no damn reason,” one speaker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers shared personal accounts of police violence and fears that their Black loved ones could wrongly face violence or death at the hands of law enforcement. One speaker recounted a conversation with her younger sister in which her sister said she was afraid to go for a walk, or for her father to leave the house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I tried to tell her that she is safe, but I know in the back of my mind that that was not true. Even if she does everything right, even if she gives them no cause to bother her, there is a chance that she might become the victim of police brutality in this country just because of who she is,” the speaker said. </span></p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-94721-2-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94743\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94744\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94768\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94747\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94742\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94741\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94746\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94745\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94748\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94766\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethan Bertrand, a member of the I.V. Community Services District Board of Directors, recalled a conversation he had with his own father before his father visited I.V. for graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to say, ‘Dad, you’re an older black man walking around our community and some people may see you as a threat. Some people may not think that you belong here, which you do, but some people don’t understand that, so please be careful,’” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so hard for us to find the strength to battle through our tears to say that once again, we’re going to stand together and stand up,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers also stressed the need for Black voices to be heard and acknowledged by non-Black communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pay attention to Black voices. Stop trying to speak over us. Stop trying to tell us what the answer is,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several UCSB administrators were in attendance at the demonstration, including Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life; Aaron Jones, director of the Educational Opportunity Program; and Diana Collins Puente, director of community affairs, student development and leadership at UCSB’s Associated Students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s absence and lack of communication prior to the start of the march was widely criticized by participants. About halfway through the speeches, Yang sent out a mass email to the student body that addressed Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for those affected by his death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His words mean very little to me at this point,” one speaker said after reading aloud Yang’s statement to the crowd.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 1:30 p.m., protestors marched through I.V. chanting and holding homemade signs, as employees at local businesses observed from behind windows or stood outdoors to cheer on protestors. Once it reached Del Playa Drive, the crowd drew Isla Vistans out onto their balconies and into their yards. Some observers held their own signs and clapped for protestors, while others silently stared as the crowd marched toward Sands Beach, gathering more marchers along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surfers on bikes and families with children stood off to the side while protestors made their way down the dirt trail to Sands Beach, eventually gathering in a circle in a small field, where the demonstration’s organizers thanked the crowd for its solidarity and called for 30 seconds of silence to remember Floyd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those 30 seconds, protesters held their fists high in the air, some closing their eyes, the sound of the breaking waves the only noise.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Courtesy of Katherine Price</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going away for college meant spending Ramadan away from home, but Muslim students made it a priority to foster their own sense of community in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, amidst the coronavirus pandemic, these students have been scattered back to their hometowns, some celebrating with their families for the first time in years, while others have stayed in Isla Vista, spending the month markedly more alone than usual.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salman Sadak, a third-year biology major and vice president of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), spent Ramadan in his hometown — his first Ramadan at home since coming to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s very nostalgic in that it gives me a feeling of the Ramadans of my childhood, like breaking the fast with my parents and family and waking up at 4 a.m. helping my mom cook,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadak said that many members of the MSA talked about how much they miss having Ramadan on campus because of how it brings them closer together. Despite the pandemic, the MSA has still been holding its weekly general meetings on Zoom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It isn’t just like a one-day event, it’s like an entire month, and you see these people every single day kind of out of necessity because you gotta eat.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At night, when they would have normally gone to the mosque for what Sadak describes as both a social and spiritual experience, they instead view a live telecast that the mosque provides.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m still getting that spiritual connection, and even though we’re all separate, we can still livestream the prayer, pray with the imam, still get that ritual in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being able to gather in-person is one of the cornerstones of celebrating Ramadan, and despite celebrating at home, physical distancing requirements have made this Ramadan different from many students’ childhood celebrations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huda Faiz, a third-year biology major and former MSA president, is currently at home, and said the connections with others were missing this year compared to normal years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Usually we go to the mosque at night for prayers and whatnot, and it’s kind of nice to connect with community and see all your family, friends and everyone in one place, but that’s kind of missing,” Faiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make up for it, Faiz said that some people have even decorated corners of their homes to resemble a mosque. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said she usually travelled back home for Eid al-Fitr to attend a celebration with her family at the Muslim Community Association, a large mosque and community center in Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll all dress up and we’ll go do our prayers there,” Faiz said, adding that most of her relatives live in Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll meet all of them and take part in the festivities,” she said. “Now, there’s nothing going on … visiting people is really big in Eid and you go and you visit all your family friends, so that’s definitely missing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tala Alawwad, a second-year biochemistry major, spent Ramadan in Isla Vista. For the most part, she would break fast alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes I did eat with friends, just as dinner for them but breaking my fast for me, and that was fine,” Alawwad said. “Home for me is in Abu Dhabi … [my family is] just home and together, and that’s usually how it is … and at least they have each other to be spiritual and engage with the traditions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Price, a first-year linguistics major and the secretary of the MSA, would have been celebrating her first Ramadan with other Muslim UCSB students this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were going to have all of these iftars, all of these dinners set up like four out of the five days of the week; we would have restaurants coming in and catering all of this really good food,” Price said. “It was going to be really exciting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as the pandemic began to shut down campus, Price said she had to start calling and cancelling all the orders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said the iftars would often draw close to 100 people, with not just undergraduate students in attendance but staff, faculty and graduate students as well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was super festive, super fun … and we really missed out on a lot of that,” Faiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the MSA has held interfaith iftars on campus, inviting other religious organizations to break fast with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Iftar is not just something for the Muslim community to take advantage of, but we also use it as a moment to get to know our fellow UCSB community and Isla Vista community, so it kind of makes me sad that we don’t really get that opportunity this year, but hopefully next year,” Sadak said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift to online classes also provided some Muslim students with more flexibility, as balancing their fasting with a full day of being on campus was often draining. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In past years, Sadak had trouble during evening classes and labs which did not allow students to eat, therefore preventing him from breaking fast during class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With online classes, it’s been more chill,” Sadak said. “Just being at home … it’s just been a lot more manageable, and I feel like professors are already really understanding about the whole COVID situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had an exam at a certain time right when I would have to break my fast, and I talked to my professor about it and he was understanding because, you know, it’s like everyone’s already dealing with so much.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz added that walking around campus all day usually left her in a “fasting fog,” in which she was more fatigued and was not able to concentrate on anything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With classes being recorded, now that they’re online, I can kind of shift my whole sleep schedule and rest a little bit during the day and watch more of the class videos at night,” Faiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Alawwad felt that online classes were actually more draining than in-person classes during Ramadan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last year, I would try to occupy myself, go to classes, see people, kill time … you’re not thinking about the hunger as much as you are sitting at home,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Faiz, being at home and indoors most of the day has made breaking fast easier compared to being at school, especially since she breaks fast with her family, a built-in community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s friends, I feel like we’d all have different schedules and sometimes it’s hard to find a time that matches for all of us to get together,” Faiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being stuck at home, Faiz, Sadak, Alawwad and Price all said they dressed up to celebrate Eid. Sadak celebrated with his family in his backyard, and Allawad called her family on Zoom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I bought my dress months in advance,” Price laughed. “I was so ready for it, I was gonna show off.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

For Morrison, the biggest losses were the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-22/university-sheriffs-office-discourage-deltopia-celebrations-in-light-of-coronavirus-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now-postponed Warm-Up</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Extravaganza concerts held annually during spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the Program Board knew these concerts couldn’t be facilitated during spring quarter, they looked for imaginative solutions, according to Morrison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, we have to really focus that our base mission is providing entertainment for students, and we can think creatively about how we can do that,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make up for spring quarter shows and events that had been pushed back or cancelled, Morrison said ASPB decided to invite high-profile speakers for Zoom events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process proved to be hectic, Morrison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We kind of just got thrown into this and started having to plan events really fast, versus [having] the previous quarter to plan these events,” Morrison said. “We were planning these events as they were happening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite having to move quickly, securing the talent was relatively straightforward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are all speakers that I would say that we couldn’t probably bring during the normal year,” Morrison said. But the virtual nature of the events sometimes made convincing the guests simpler — the usual costs and hassles associated with traveling, staffing and paying for a venue would not be necessary, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And because </span><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/features/hollywood-coronavirus-entertainment-industry-unemployment-jobs-1234592106/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">performers in a frozen entertainment industry</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> no longer have the assurance of steady pay, they have become more flexible with their schedules, according to Morrison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Their whole livelihood was basically doing events, so I think that now they’re honestly looking for these types of gigs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to Zoom, however, was not not completely smooth. For the first few gatherings, Morrison recounted one instance of Zoombombing and difficulties ensuring that event attendees were not from outside of UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the small issues aside, I think it’s been great and I think that people have really come together and worked hard to make these events flow,” Morrison said, adding that all ASPB members have begun to moderate events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison pointed to the Binging with Babish event as one instance of success this quarter, where the titular YouTube personality offered viewers a behind-the-scenes tour of his filming locations — a clandestine opportunity that students wouldn’t have received had the show taken place in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was our first time doing a big virtual event with an outside talent using this new webinar platform,” Morrison said. “And everyone was just so nice and wonderful and wholesome. It was really sweet.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that first event, the ASPB has hosted events ranging from a talk with comedian Eric Andre to a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/lil-paint-y-with-lil-yachty/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">night of painting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with rapper Lil Yachty, complete with a question-and-answer session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When UCSB eventually transitions back to on-campus instruction, the ASPB will likely dial back the frequency of high-profile visits, Morrison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s wanting to use students’ fees in the best way possible,” she said. “It would be harder to bring in the talent that we are bringing — we’re able to do this because of this kind of new situation and because the costs of it are a lot different.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when UCSB switches back to on-campus learning, Morrison said that the ASPB won’t forget the difficulties they overcame.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing I think [the pandemic] taught us: to be really appreciative of this opportunity that we have on board to book events for students,” Morrison said. “I don’t think we realized until it was gone just how much we love

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tonight’s agenda included a hefty 17 bills and resolutions, a high number in part because all bills and resolutions from last week were pushed after the </span><a

abrupt end due to Zoombombing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to pass the remaining bills — which had to have been tabled for a week before being voted on — the Senate must hold two more meetings before the end of the quarter. The Senate now plans to meet this Friday at 11 a.m. to vote on the agenda for tonight’s meeting, and again on May 3 at 6 p.m. to vote on tabled bills, pending the approval of Dean of Student Life and Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead to hold a meeting during Week 10. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a regular Senate term, Week 9 of spring quarter is the last meeting of the year before the summer break; due to Zoombombings, the 71st Senate has not been able to hold a full meeting or vote on any resolutions since the new senators were sworn in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tonight’s meeting began just after 6:30 p.m., but was stalled as White had difficulty navigating Zoom during the meeting. After Off-Campus Senator Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan motioned to approve all 2020-21 year appointments, with the exception of Attorney General Tyler Barth and those within the Internal Vice President’s (IVP) office, a debate broke out about when to discuss the appointments that had not been pushed through.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After running into problems with voting without the Zoom poll feature, White created a new Zoom link to include the feature. However, immediately after participants joined the new link, multiple Zoombombers disrupted the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Zoombomber loudly shouted, “Fuck you, fuck you dirty bitch.” Others displayed obscene media, including a video of someone appearing to masturbate on camera. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, White muted all participants’ microphones and created a separate Zoom breakout room for the senators to discuss how to handle the rest of the meeting. As senators discussed options, approximately 40 people remained in the main meeting room, where Zoombombers continued to show obscene photos as their images. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once senators realized the disturbances were ongoing, White told senators she would make a new link — the third of the night — to be shared only with the senators and Associated Students (A.S.) staff. A.S. Legislative Liaison Holly Mayes then ended the original meeting without warning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senators then met for over an hour in a private Zoom call to discuss when to hold future meetings and what precautions should be taken in light of the Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the last meeting, the senators had thrown around a handful of ideas about how to conduct secure, but public, Zoom meetings. Moving forward, meetings will now be held as Zoom webinars, where only panelists are visible and able to speak, as opposed to anyone in the meeting, according to White. For public forum, individuals will be enabled as panelists when it is their turn to talk, and then will be removed as panelists after speaking in order to prevent future Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To alleviate technical difficulties in executing the new webinar system at the next meeting, senators plan to meet 30 minutes before the meeting on Friday to run through the new format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During tonight’s private meeting, senators also began working on a public statement to address the Zoombombings and the abrupt ending to the regular meeting. White said the Senate plans to publish the statement tomorrow afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista’s average response rate is under 50%, below the national response rate of about 60% and Santa Barbara County’s overall self-response rate of about 64%, according to the United States Census 2020 website. I.V. is divided into three census tracts, which are subdivisions in each county used in the counting process; I.V.’s three tracts divide the unincorporated district into strips perpendicular to the ocean. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista has been designated a hard-to-count community. This was before the pandemic,” Spencer Brandt, president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V.

With the pandemic forcing social distancing regulations and</span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the retreat of Santa Barbara Community College and UC Santa Barbara students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, educating  I.V. residents and conducting typical census outreach has been complicated. If response rates remain low, the community risks losing crucial funding, Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether or not people are counted in our community will affect a ton of different government and education-related programs for funding and how much funding Isla Vista and the UCSB area receives,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of the census affect a decade’s worth of congressional representation and federal funding in communities, which could go toward projects ranging from infrastructure and highways to school lunches and special education, according to the </span><a href=\"https://2020census.gov/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Census website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normal deadlines and operations in the census project have been extended due to complications from the coronavirus pandemic, and the I.V. CSD is looking for volunteers to start calling households as part of the next phase of the census tracking, according to the I.V. CSD website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a similar point in the 2010 U.S. Census, I.V.’s response rate was about 60%, according to the I.V. CSD website. None of the three census tracts in Isla Vista have reached 50% as of May 26, and</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“undercount of this magnitude would severely negatively impact Isla Vista’s funding until the year 2030,” according to the I.V.

Both the decision to divest from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy were made under this policy, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the university and its stakeholders are much better served by investing in promising opportunities in the alternative energy field rather than gambling on oil and gas,” Richard Sherman, chair of the UC Board of Regents’ Investments Committee, said in the press release.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also noted in the press release that the journey to divestment took a significant step when the UC sold off its investments in coal and oil sands one year after the UC Investment Office adopted the ESG policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to concern from investors about the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on fossil fuel stock prices, Bachher said in the press release that the UC’s divestment represents an important turning point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we certainly could not have predicted the speed nor depth of the recent downturn in the traditional energy sector, signs point to a structural shift — not merely another cycle of boom or bust,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also said in the press release that the “lowered demand and oversupply” of fossil fuels “could portend an even longer price drought in oil and gas” as the world recovers from the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, the UC investments team is committed to growing its investments in sustainable practices such as renewable energy, waste conversion, sustainable agriculture and technology associated with these goals, the press release stated. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

The new mandate also does not apply to children under 13, as well as those who are unable to wear face coverings for medical reasons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The order </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will remain in place until at least June 30, barring earlier removal by the public health department. Failure to comply with the new mandate, which constitutes as a misdemeanor, could be punishable with a fine of up to $1,000, imprisonment or both, according to the order. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A face covering is defined as “a covering made of cloth, fabric or permeable materials, without holes, that covers only the nose and mouth and surrounding areas of the lower face,” according to the order, and includes scarves, bandanas, homemade coverings and masks, among other variations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents who do not own face coverings can receive one for free at the Santa Barbara Administration building lobby, the Santa Barbara Health Care Center or the Santa Maria Health Care Center, the order stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County first released its phase two reopening guidelines on May 21, allowing businesses like dine-in restaurants, schools and some offices to resume business, according </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to a press release issued by the county. Within Isla Vista, restaurants like Woodstock’s and Rockfire Grill have partially reopened for dine-in meals, although public spaces within restaurants, like bars and gaming areas, must remain closed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses that are allowed to reopen in this phase will be required to make modifications to decrease the risk of coronavirus spread, including new safety training for staff and enforcement of social distancing for patrons, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses must also “review state and local guidance, complete a COVID-19 Prevention Plan, and self-certify that they can open safely,” to receive a certificate from the county and reopen legally, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This next phase of our reopening process will help get more Santa Barbara County residents back to work, while ensuring that local businesses modify operations to keep their customers and workers safe,” according to a </span><a href=\"http://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedFiles/phd/PROGRAMS/Disease_Control/Corona/HOO2020-8-2Stage2.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new health order</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> issued by the County’s Public Health Department in response to the phase two approval.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The phase two reopening is part of a four-stage </span><a href=\"http://readysbc.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reopening In Safe Environment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (RISE) plan from California Gov.

The state approved the attestation on May 20, allowing an “exciting next step for our entire community,” Van Do-Reynoso, director of the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, said in the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Santa Barbara County is implementing a program to help businesses expand into “public right-of-way outdoor areas” in the county’s unincorporated regions to help advance social distancing protocols, the press release read. A second phase of the project is in development to help businesses expand onto private property, like parking lots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the evening of May 21 in Isla Vista, the Study Hall Bar and Grill was open for business in </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-22/study-hall-bar-open-thursday-night-in-violation-of-county-and-state-health-order/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">direct violation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the state and county stay-at-home orders — and the phase two guidelines — after it was seen serving at least 10 people without masks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Gov.

After rumors first began to spread about Beasley’s alleged inappropriate behavior, second-year communications and economics double major Izzy Mitchell created a Google Form petition to recall Beasley, which as of May 17, had over 600 unverified signatures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell needs 542 verified signatures for her petition to be valid. However, the board recently announced it will be requiring signatures to be collected through a newly created “secure university platform,” which means that any signatures that have already been collected through unofficial methods will not be considered valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under no circumstances will the AS Elections Board accept or verify any online ‘signatures’ collected through a third-party platform,” the board said in a </span><a href=\"https://ucsb.app.box.com/s/d79ga8w8p4k1n2dwm3u1rcll3srssknf?fbclid=IwAR17QBsfrUuB2Ydb9mvl3m_3W57roaQxV4NHdO8fNrrl5iKFdDVCW3VcgHc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> posted to its Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its statement, Elections Board said it was doing so to ensure that there was a “confidential” process in place through a university-affiliated website, and that the petition itself included “legal language from AS Election Code &amp; Legal Code for any fee/recall petitions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Elections Board said the verified platform includes a “secure digital signature field” like DocuSign, and requires students to log in with their UCSB NetID to prevent duplicate signatures and ensure all signatures are from UCSB students; the new collection method would also allow administrators to more quickly verify the signatures.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum at Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Mitchell criticized the board’s decision to require collection through a different platform, noting that the procedures were put in place nearly two weeks after she began circulating her petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to senators who asked Elections Board to consider compromising with Mitchell given the number of signatures she had already collected, the board told the Senate that they would work to help Mitchell convert already-collected signatures to the new platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, board members Davis Quan and Andrew Yan said the board was “scrambling” when they first learned that a recall petition had been created, which they said they only learned about after the Nexus reached out on May 4 asking for information regarding recall procedures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the board itself does not meet outside of election season, the board had considered election season over and had already begun to disperse by the time the petition was released, Quan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Legal Code does not specify how to conduct a recall election, only that 20% of the student body must vote and that two-thirds of those students must vote yes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For typical recall petitions, signatures are collected in-person and on clipboards; Quan said Elections Board tried to mimic in-person procedures when determining how a recall petition and election would work during remote instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Mitchell’s petition receives enough verified signatures, the 71st Senate must vote on the petition twice — once to ratify the petition results, which Elections Board referred to as a “procedural vote,” and then to call for a recall election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two-thirds of the 71st Senate must vote in favor in order for a recall election to be held in Fall Quarter 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the vote passes, the fall quarter election, which the board anticipates would be held in the first few weeks of the quarter, will only have one question on the ballot that will ask if students want to recall Beasley. If students vote in favor of recalling Beasley, Quan said a special election to elect a new president would likely take place in Winter Quarter 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that if Beasley is recalled, there is no language in Legal Code that would prevent him from running again in the special election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yan said they had looked to previous recall elections in the state of California as precedent to determine if they would hold one election both for the recall vote and Beasley’s replacement, or two separate elections; ultimately, they decided that despite potential voter fatigue, they didn’t want people campaigning for the presidency ahead of the recall vote itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the 2018-19 academic year, Elections Board held two special elections to fill the position of external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA), both of which </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/about-2-2-percent-of-student-body-has-voted-in-evpsa-special-election/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed to meet the voter threshold</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the election to be considered valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, there was no EVPSA for the 2018-19 academic year, although many of the job duties were </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-redistributing-honoraria-to-evpsa-office-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fulfilled by other individuals and organizations.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Beasley is recalled but the special election to fill the position of president does not meet the voter threshold, Yan said that the position would not go unfilled. Unlike the EVPSA position, there is a line of succession for A.S. President in Legal Code, which says that the Internal Vice President (IVP) will serve as acting president until a new one can be elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current IVP is third-year political science major Tianna White, who was sworn in on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has only been one previous recall movement in recent A.S. history. In 2014, students attempted to recall External Vice President for Local Affairs-elect Beatrice Contreras, who was accused at the time of sexual assault. The petition to recall Contreras did not receive enough signatures; however, Contreras </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/two-associated-students-politicians-abdicate-positions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">later resigned from office</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

A couple of salient memories of the time for me include having to tell the women of Tri Delta that they had lost two of their members due to a senseless act of violence. A happier memory is creating the I Heart UCSB Pledge with student leaders that is now read with all new UCSB students during orientation as they receive the I Heart UCSB pin. I will be remembering the students we lost this Saturday while I visit the benches created in their memory, located in the Love and Remembrance Garden that I helped envision and organize.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yasamin Salari — 2020-21 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista has been the first place I’ve felt at home since I moved to the U.S. The vibrant sense of community, the friends who have supported me through all my ups and downs in the past three years and the mere beauty of our campus are just a few reasons I’ve felt so welcomed here. Our beautiful town has also endured great hardships. I was only a freshman in high school when the May 23, 2014 tragedy occurred in I.V., but my brother was a student at UCSB at that time and I remember so distinctly the sense of grief that took over my family that night. Although it was the immense sense of grief that brought together our community at first, we have continued to commemorate this day by remembering and honoring the lives lost on May 23.</span></p>\n<p><b>Christian Ornelas — 2019-20 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the last four years, Isla Vista has been my home. It has sheltered me and given me the tools I needed to grow. In my role as the External Vice President for Local Affairs, I had the privilege of developing relationships with the many people that dedicate their lives to making this community a safe and inclusive home for all of us. This special little place by the sea has taught me the value of friends, neighbors and community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I was not in Isla Vista on May 23, 2014, I continue to feel the collective grief shared by our community. The aftermath of that day brought together a beloved community that continues to memorialize the lives lost. We remember George Chen, Katherine Breann Cooper, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, Weihan “David” Wang and Veronika Elizabeth Weiss. If you find yourself in I.V. on Saturday, I invite you to pick some flowers and leave them at the Isla Vista Love and Remembrance Garden adjacent to Embarcadero Hall in People’s Park.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To all the caretakers of Isla Vista — thank you. Let us never forget about the events that took place in 2014, and let us always remember to move forward with love and compassion in honor of those we lost.</span></p>\n<p><b>Jeike Meijer — 2018-19 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the painful circumstance of being physically separated this year, it is really difficult to come together and mourn in community. We are learning non-physical ways to show our remembrance. This year, I’ll be using virtual ways to send remembrance to the lives lost and the friends and families of the victims. I also will be giving energy and healing to the first responders and community members whose lives were so pivotally impacted on this day of tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will also be stopping by the Remembrance Garden on May 23 to mourn because that has become a place of gathering to honor the six lives lost. George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katherine Cooper, Christopher Michael-Martinez, Veronika Weiss: You will never be forgotten.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spencer Brandt — President of the Board of Directors of Isla Vista Community Services District</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My generation of students was the first to be fully removed from the May 23 tragedy. Unlike many of my friends that I would come to know and love, we were not in harm’s way when shots were fired. I was sitting at my parents house, watching the gruesome news unfold on Twitter. As I scrolled down the timeline, it became clear that the killer had left a manifesto of misogynistic ramblings that provided a clear motive for the violence. Soon, in a reaction to many users arguing that “not all men” held such misogynistic views, #YesAllWomen began trending, drawing attention to the harassment and discrimination that women experience every day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six years later, we can’t be physically together to memorialize the tragedy. But for me, the distance allows time to reflect on May 23 in ways that I haven’t in the past. This year, I’ve been thinking about how, as a straight white male, the tragedy reminds me of the responsibility I have to live out masculinity in a healthy way. Because toxic masculinity was an important factor in the misogynistic “incel” ideology that the May 23 killer professed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is no secret that toxic masculinity abounds in a college town like ours. As an elected official, I spend a lot of time focusing on worst manifestations of it: sexual assault, street harassment and interpersonal violence. And in 2014, mass murder. And while most in I.V. agree that these things are pervasive problems that we ought to solve, there is less discussion about how to promote and cultivate a positive vision of masculinity: one that means loving and respecting others, being honest with yourself about your emotions and desires and taking assertive action to stop unhealthy and harmful behaviors in other men. We owe it to George, James, David, Katherine, Veronika and Chris to have these difficult conversations, and constantly be doing what we can to make IV’s culture more inclusive.</span></p>\n<p><b>Margaret Klawunn — Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I arrived at UCSB in the fall of 2015.  I have been honored to participate in important commemorations of the loss this community suffered in 2014 each year that I have been here.  This year, I am on my way to the Love and Remembrance Garden to leave flowers there in honor of George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katie Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss. I recognize that others were wounded and many more deeply affected by the violence of May 23, 2014. This year, I am feeling deeply the impact of the coronavirus and the social inequities it has laid bare, and this grief and loss resounds with the misogyny and violence of 2014.  It is also evident to me that there has also been some incredible love and light that emerged as this community came together, and I continue to see that strength and power in Isla Vista among students, staff, faculty and residents. </span></p>\n<p><b>Batsheva Labowe-Stoll — 2017-18 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tragedy that occurred on May 23, 2014 in Isla Vista changed our community forever. The immense grief of students and community members sent shock waves that are still felt today. Yet through all the sadness and fear, Isla Vista came together to create incredible monuments in our community. Through hard work and advocacy, we now have a local government that listens and responds to the needs of its constituents. Today, I.V. is a safer, stronger, more resilient place than it was six years ago. We are more aware, more attentive and have no tolerance for hatred and violence. Our community will forever mourn the unnecessary and tragic deaths that occurred that day, but we will continue to be strong and move forward together.</span></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Abboud </b><b>— </b><b>General Manager, Isla Vista Community Services District</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still remember the days leading up, the day of and the days after so clearly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it always feels like yesterday. I knew someone who was murdered, some who were injured and countless people who were moments away from having been in the wrong place. I wasn’t in I.V. that night and had just completed my term as student body president, but rushed back as soon as possible the next day. I still hold some guilt over not being in town when it happened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That night changed me and many others, along with Isla Vista itself, forever. It was actually gut-wrenching at the time to see how Isla Vista was getting the attention it needed only after and because of six people being murdered. Ending the cycle of only supporting Isla Vista after major tragedies was a big reason why we created the Isla Vista Community Services District. I decided to stay in I.V. after graduating in the following weeks to work on this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, we can never forget those who were taken from us that night (George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katie Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss) and not give any attention to the person behind the tragedy. But it’s also important to remember how May 23 is connected to misogyny, white supremacy, toxic masculinity, gun violence, the incel ideology and in a way our broken mental health system. We need to always push against these things locally and beyond as they continue to drive other tragedies around the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, I’m staying home and getting in touch with the people who were also affected that night. I will also take a walk through the remembrance garden at the park.</span></p>\n<p><em>This article will be updated. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/","id":4061,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4060,4059,4058],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Regents Committee Drafts Plans To Reduce UC Food and Housing Insecurity by 2022","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-21-at-7.45.20-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-21-at-7.45.20-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UC has currently been allocated $260 million through the federal C.A.R.E.S. act, $130 million of which was allocated to campuses for the distribution of emergency grants for students.

financial aid at the federal, state and university levels.” </span><em>Courtesy of Regents Livestream</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Special Committee, which was created in 2018 to produce recommendations on basic needs for UC students, heard from UC Basic Needs Committee Co-Chairs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim Galarneau and Ruben Canedo, who presented about the coronavirus pandemic’s economic and social toll on the UC and its students before going on to review recommendations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can now visibly see how income levels, ethnicity, family structure, citizenship status and access to healthcare affect student’s access to education and their mental health,” a UC San Diego student observer said during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And those disparities have definitely been visible when it comes to basic needs resources,” the student observer continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yvette Gullatt, vice provost for Diversity and Engagement and chief outreach officer for the University of California, said the special committee is concerned with both “articulat[ing] our concerns while also moving forward” and has delayed discussion about its recommendations for the UC Regents September meeting, when the committee would be evaluating how pertinent their recommendations have proven to be. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One goal of the new recommendations is to “advocate for greater investment in financial aid at the federal, state and university levels.” Paired with the timing of the coronavirus pandemic, additional financial aid could serve to reduce the financial burden many UC students are currently experiencing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC has currently been allocated $260 million through the federal C.A.R.E.S. act, $130 million of which was allocated to campuses for the distribution of emergency grants for students, according to Director of Student Financial Support Shawn Brick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Student Regent Hayley Wheddle, the head of the Special Committee, spearheaded the basic needs report over her year-long term; Tuesday’s meeting was her last as a student regent. She commended the UC on “proactively looking to fill the gaps” in financial aid, as the committee aims to push federal funding going forward, according to the committee’s draft recommendations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the meeting, presenters and speakers emphasized the need to utilize CalFresh, which can now be used to purchase online groceries, and the possibility of waiving the 20-hour per-week work requirements that are usually necessary to qualify for the food assistance program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their drafted recommendations emphasized the importance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maximizing overall enrollment in CalFresh through “running large-scale onsite CalFresh enrollment clinics,” as well as “training county departments of social services workers to support UC students with CalFresh application and enrollment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the committee hopes to assist students who are not eligible for CalFresh with various on-campus programs and aims to close the 22% gap in food insecurity between first-generation and non-first-generation students, according to the report.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campuses have been made responsible for UC students who are now, due to moving back to their hometowns, closer to a different UC campus than the one that they are enrolled in. According to the committee Co-Chair Tim Galarneau,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> UC students can receive certain services on any given campus such as meal swipes, bagged grocery pickup, temporary housing and emergency grants regardless of which campus they’re enrolled at.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But because of the coronavirus pandemic, Galarneau said, many campuses are inherently under-equipped for “daily uncertainties and major changes to resources, policies, processes, and decision making” as a result of limited staffing and uncertainty surrounding future funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With basic needs providers on college campuses designated as first responders to the coronavirus pandemic, the Special Committee on Basic Needs hopes to address the challenges the UC is facing with help from local campuses and their basic needs providers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our basic needs movement is a nascent one, coinciding with natural disasters and a pandemic, coinciding when food security and a sense of community have been needed the most,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gullatt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is changing as the needs of students change.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by UC President Janet Napolitano, follows the path of a number of institutions across the country that have gone </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/10/18/record-number-colleges-drop-satact-admissions-requirement-amid-growing-disenchantment-with-standardized-tests/\"><span style=\"font-weight:

As the largest university system in the nation to eliminate the test, the UC’s decision will likely have a ripple effect across the country, according to the Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 2025 onward, California applicants will be judged by a new testing standard to assess knowledge that “better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC’s values,” Napolitano’s report read. No decision has been made yet for out-of-state and international students, who might continue using the SAT and ACT or be judged by the UC’s future standardized test assessment, the details of which have yet to be determined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a new test has not been implemented by 2025, the testing requirement for California students will be eliminated altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to move in a careful and studied way to the new future for the University … a better test should be what we aim for in California,” Napolitano told the Regents, saying one goal in the creation of a new test is to help strengthen college preparedness in California high schools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also want to work …  to analyze and drill down into factors that contribute to disproportionate representation, or rather underrepresentation, of students from underserved communities in our population. We are a public university after all,” Napolitano told the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/uc-relaxes-admission-requirements-due-to-coronavirus-related-challenges/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and 2022 application cycles, the SAT and ACT will be optional. This is partially due to the cancellation of tests due to the coronavirus but extends the optional period to two years instead of the original one-year extension as approved by the Regents in March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2023 and 2024 application cycles, admissions will be “test blind.” Students may submit an SAT or ACT score for reasons other than admissions, such as “course placement, certain scholarships, and eligibility for the statewide admissions guarantee,” where students across the state with top scores are guaranteed admission to a UC, according to Napolitano’s recommendation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano acknowledged that the new testing assessment might draw on other standardized tests. In her comments, she mentioned that the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC), an 11th grade standardized test already used in California and other states, could be fitted for college admission testing in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was debate among the regents over whether to continue use of the ACT and SAT while a new test was in the works, a similar line of reasoning to that of the Academic Senate’s Standardized Testing Task Force </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report to the Regents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February, where the task force recommended keeping the ACT and SAT in place until a replacement test is finalized.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/06/groups-demand-university-california-stop-using-satact-scores-admissions-alleging-tests-discriminate-against-underprivileged-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-20/is-sat-test-going-down-at-uc-several-uc-regents-express-deep-skepticism-over-use-in-admissions-process\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">critics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the years have shared the attitude that both income and race are indicators of success on standardized tests, with an industry developing around years-long preparation and some beginning as early as middle school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/california-groups-demand-uc-drop-the-sat-saying-they-illegally-discriminate-against-disadvantaged-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the UC to eliminate the test in admissions.

the business and walking out of the bar that were not wearing masks, including an individual behind the bar, around 11:30 p.m., when the bar was shutting down for the night. </span></p>\n<p><span

A sign at the door said “no mask, no entry.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bar was closed by approximately 11:40 p.m., according to a Nexus photographer on the scene. During normal business hours, Study Hall is open from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. </span></p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) received complaints about Study Hall last night, according to Public Information Officer Raquel Zick.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Study Hall did not answer multiple phone calls made late Thursday night while the business was still open. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Santa Barbara County </span><a href=\"http://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedFiles/phd/PROGRAMS/Disease_Control/Corona/HOO2020-8-2Stage2.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">public health order,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> violations can punished with a “fine of up to $1,000, imprisonment, or both.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This Order is issued because of the propensity of the virus to spread person to person,” the order read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The violation of any provision of this Order constitutes a threat to public health.”</span></p>\n<p>In a statement to the Nexus, Santa Barbara County Public Health Department said they had not heard any complaints about Study Hall.</p>\n<p>If a complaint comes to them, the statement said, county personnel would reach out to the “appropriate jurisdiction” to educate them about what is permissible under state and local guidelines. The statement said that the county “only resorts to punitive measures if the entity in question continually disregards the Health Officer Order.”</p>\n<p><em>Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updated [5/22/20]: This article has been updated to include statements from SBSO and Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
