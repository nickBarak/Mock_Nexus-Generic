are supported in the community,” said Andrew Gabriel Pragin, a UCSB alumnus who focuses on issues affecting I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pragin noted that although arrests and citations declined this year, the numbers increased as a percentage of those who attended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Adams, chair of the board and fourth district supervisor, said the people who attended Deltopia 2016 must have been the ones who were causing problems in past years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though you had less people attending, those are the people that were the problem in the first place,” Adams said, adding that those people will not learn to “conduct themselves in an adult fashion” until they “get arrested a few more times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe they’ll learn their lesson at some point, I know I did,” Adams said. “I just think that this number will go down if we keep chipping away at that culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay Freeman, an Isla Vista resident running for third district supervisor, was very critical of the report, and said I.V. Safe acts as if Isla Vista is “a dangerous infestation” and “a problem to be solved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman unfurled large posters of what he said were previous advertising campaigns by I.V. Safe. He said the committee “truly crossed a line” when it ran a picture of inside a medical tent with the caption, “Throwback Thursday to people having a blast at Deltopia last year.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The message of I.V. Safe is one of a totalitarian police state trying to scare people into compliance,” Freeman said, adding that the group’s “rebranding” commercial “comes off as a campaign advertisement for a handful of politicians.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69454\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69454\" data-attachment-id=\"69454\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/isla-vista-crime-down-25-over-two-years-da-reports/board-of-supervisors-meeting-4-5-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Board of Supervisors Meeting 4-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69454\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second District Supervisor Janet Wolf disagreed, saying the advertisement campaign might help others realize that there are consequences to drinking heavily in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pictures of the kids in the tent who were getting medical treatment, it was horrible to me,” Wolf said. “It just kind of struck home to me that this could happen.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board members were very supportive of the campaign, thanking the report’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributors extensively, and were hopeful for what they see as an improved I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First District Supervisor Salud Carbajal said I.V.

in recent years, resulting in a less devastating aftermath of pollution in the small, oceanside area. This year, an approximate 250 volunteers assembled at 11 a.m. to clean up I.V. — a considerably smaller group than the 349 volunteers in 2015 and 367 in 2014, but just as successful as in previous years.</p>\n<p>Most volunteers tend to be I.V. residents who want to keep their neighborhood clean, according to Adam Portè, Adopt-A-Block supervisor. “Unfortunately, a lot of the times the people that were partying here on Saturday night are gone by Sunday morning,” said Portè, who was pleased to see the work completed in two hours after posting pictures online of the 66 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69346\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69346\" data-attachment-id=\"69346\"

Rather than admiring the images, however, students were staring at the ground.</p>\n<p>“Trump build the wall 2016,” “Obama is a Muslim” and “Muhammad fucked children” were among the slogans etched in chalk throughout campus, concentrated around the North Hall mural and South Hall, which holds the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. On the sidewalk in front of the Asian Resource Center was the phrase, “Currency is devalued.”</p>\n<p>UCSB maintenance staff washed much of the chalk away by Thursday afternoon, leaving only blurred marks and puddles, but many students remained troubled by the aggressive messages.</p>\n<p>“Given the climate, given what [Donald] Trump’s name has come to mean — that it’s connected to white

Segev completed the surgery in early March, transplanting a liver and kidney from a deceased HIV-positive donor to two HIV-positive recipients. Although the procedure posed the risk of transplanting a different HIV strain, the surgery was successful for both patients.</p>\n<p>President Barack Obama signed the H.O.P.E. Act into law in November 2013, allowing the use of organs from HIV-positive donors for transplantations and laboratory studies. The initial ban was enacted in the 1980s as a solution to a climate of fear surrounding HIV/A.I.D.S., research has since found HIV-positive donations to be safe for transplant.</p>\n<p>CJ Young, representative from Lois Capps’s office, said Capps is “extremely excited” about the successful surgeries and that research resulting from the H.O.P.E. Act has removed the stigmas surrounding HIV-positive donors.</p>\n<p>“Eliminating the stigma around HIV is critically important; that stigma can be a barrier to gaining access to treatment,” Young said. LGBTQ communities were “drastically impacted” by the stigmatization of HIV donors, Young said, and former school nurse Capps used the legislation to help amend the problem.</p>\n<p>During a press conference on Wednesday, Dr. Christine Durand of Johns Hopkins said both transplant patients, who wished to have their identities kept private, are doing “extremely well.” The kidney patient has returned home, and the liver patient is expected to be discharged in a few days.</p>\n<p>“The patient would have remained on the waitlist for years,” said Dr. Durand, describing donor conditions prior to the H.O.P.E. Act.</p>\n<p>The use of HIV-positive organ donors can potentially add 300 to 500 donors to the current waitlists, serving nearly 1,000 recipients, said Dr. Segev. The success of the surgery combined with the legislation in the H.O.P.E. Act promises future life-saving transplants for HIV-positive patients and those with end-stage organ diseases.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69216\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69216\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/","id":3899,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3898,3897,3896],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Billionaire Donates $200M To Fix ‘Gross’ Dorms","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=501%2C370&ssl=1","description":"Billionaire Charles Munger donated a record-breaking $200 million to UCSB on Thursday, designating the funds for a state-of-the-art on campus residence hall.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Billionaire Charles Munger donated a record-breaking $200 million to UCSB on Thursday, designating the funds for a state-of-the-art on campus residence hall.</p>\n<p>Munger’s donation will be used as a seed fund for two development projects at UCSB, utilizing 28 acres of land where the Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and San Nicolas dorms currently exist.

The buildings will have kitchens to reduce meal plan costs, and the top floor of each design will be dedicated to six acres of common room space.</p>\n<p>“Every campus I know of in the world abuses its undergraduates … it finally gets pretty gross,” Munger said, emphasizing the importance of healthy living areas.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69147\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"93804457\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69145\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69147\" data-attachment-id=\"69147\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/billionaire-donates-200m-to-fix-gross-dorms/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-3-21-53-pm-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?fit=501%2C370&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"501,370\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-28 at 3.21.53 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?fit=501%2C370&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69147\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=350%2C258\" width=\"350\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?w=501&amp;ssl=1 501w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69147\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Munger’s dorms will replace Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and San Nicolas Hall.</p></div>\n<p>To accommodate for high student density, Munger plans to replace real windows in several rooms with artificial windows, inspired by artificial portholes on Disney cruise lines which feature “a starfish that comes by and winks at your kid,” said Munger.</p>\n<p>Matilda Mead, third-year psychology major and Residence Hall Association President, said although “overwhelmed by his generosity,” she was disappointed by the conditions of Munger’s donation.</p>\n<p>“By replacing the those views with his artificial windows, it seems to me as though we would be neglecting our residents from experiencing a large aspect of what they came to UCSB to see: the picturesque scenery,” Mead said. “Besides, I highly doubt any artificial windows would be able to replicate [or] replace our spectacular sunsets.”</p>\n<p>According to Mead, mental health and academic resources are “severely lacking” on campus, and the best use for Munger’s donation would be to build additional support spaces for students.</p>\n<p>“I just hope he can look at the whole picture and focus on the needs of our residents rather than the aesthetics of our university when determining where his donation will go,” Mead said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T.

If the UC does not continue to support him, Munger will go elsewhere with his plan, but he is enthusiastic about developing at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The UC System has the power of eminent domain,” Munger said. “If it really makes sense to revolutionize housing for the better on one campus, it can be done on other campuses.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An earlier version of this article did not include San Miguel and San Nicolas dorms in the list of residences that will be replaced.

resigned after a campus investigation found he had violated the university’s sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>“It was just time to say look, the sanctions need to match the seriousness of the behavior that’s substantiated,” Napolitano said in the radio interview. “We just don’t tolerate this kind of activity at the University of California, be it at Berkeley or be it at any other campus.”</p>\n<p>Under the new policy, sanctions imposed on administrators in these positions would need to be reviewed by the committee, which would then send its recommendation to the campus chancellor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As before the committee’s creation, Napolitano will have the final say as to how senior leaders are reprimanded.</span></p><div

Honoraria is a system of payment for students serving in BCUs, and College of Engineering Senator Sara Maroofi and Off-Campus Senator Louis Mariano penned a reform of honoraria to accommodate for</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the limited A.S. budget created by undergraduate fees. Among other bill items, Senate passed an honoraria cap which ensures that general appointed officials shall not receive honoraria higher than $200 per quarter, chairs or vice chairs shall not receive higher that $350 and senators shall not receive higher than $400. Claiming a lack of correspondence with all BCUs affected by the changes, 59 senators and BCU members signed a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ADemandforaSpecialSenateMeetingon3916RegardingABilltoReformHonoraria.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demand</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> calling for the 66th A.S. Senate to address student grievances in a special meeting and reassess the legislation to table it until Spring Quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers took issue with the senate’s method of correspondence, and said emailing BCUs the senate agenda was an inadequate form of relaying information. In the demand for a special Senate meeting, signees claimed that senate violated the A.S. 2015-16 Legal Code in passing the bill, because BCU chairs affected by the process were not directly contacted. According to the legal code, A.S. can legally amend honoraria policies every Winter Quarter of an even year after having “written or oral consultation with all parties involved.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68981\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68981\" data-attachment-id=\"68981\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/students-clash-over-honoraria-charges/senate-march-9_by-lorenzo-basilio-16/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate March 9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68981\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68981\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that you all think this is a communicative process boggles my mind,” Akshaya Natarajan, signee of the demand, off-campus senator and second-year political science and Asian-American studies double major, said.

If we want to foster effective communication, it doesn’t make sense that we’re passing this [bill] this quarter.” Natarajan said to the senate, drawing affirmative snapping and a standing ovation from the BCUs gathered at the meeting. “When we make mistakes, it is our responsibility to apologize, and that’s what we didn’t do last time.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Do not be confused, fellow senators.

light UCSB’s Eternal Flame — meant to be a symbol of peace between nations — but found the flame could not be lit.</p>\n<p>Williams, the initiator for the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Campaign, said he had asked Chancellor Henry T. Yang several weeks ago if he would fix the flame to remain lit through rain or wind, but arrived to find the flame already burning.</p>\n<p>“We came a little disappointed that we didn’t get to do the ceremony as we’d asked, but we were happy that it was lit,” Williams said. “I was confident it would stay lit.”</p>\n<p>However, as Williams honored the memorial on Wednesday, the flame continued to go out.</p>\n<p>Williams hopes students encourage the university to make “a mental shift” to prioritize the Eternal Flame.</p>\n<p>“Here’s the University of California, whose scientists have made all our nuclear weapons, and now the chancellor is even an electrical engineer, and I’m sure they can figure out how to keep a flame burning without the wind or the rain blowing it out,” Williams said. “But it’s just not important enough, and it won’t be important enough, I believe, until the students make it important enough.”</p>\n<p>Andrea Estrada, a spokesperson for UCSB, explained that in order for the flame to burn regularly, a new underground gas line and starter would need to be installed.</p>\n<p>“A number of fixes have been attempted in the past, but they haven’t addressed the main problems,” Estrada said, adding that it was important that the university find a “more permanent fix” before taking additional action.</p>\n<p>“It is being discussed and certainly we don’t want to have an eternal flame that’s not functioning,” Estrada said.</p>\n<p>Williams said although fixing the flame may be expensive, it is significant to community members and leaders who have worked to preserve the historic flame.</p>\n<p>If the flame is not fixed, “it’s going to be disappointing for a lot of people,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>If the flame is eventually lit, it will be carried in the Annual Global Peace Walk from Taos, N.M. to Santa Fe. It will then be carried in the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Peace March in summer where it will travel from New York City to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to The White House.</p>\n<p>Williams, who called himself a “peace movement activist and a spiritual practitioner” began the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Campaign in 1990 and has been passionate about keeping the Eternal Flame lit since the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The Eternal Flame monument was given as a gift to the university from the UCSB class of 1968.</p>\n<p>Williams stressed the importance of UCSB’s Eternal Flame and its extensive history, including its being lit in 1990 with the Hiroshima Peace Flame, a peace symbol after the end of World War II.</p>\n<p>“[That flame] was lit in the [1990s] as a prayer for peace that Hiroshima should never happen again anywhere in the world,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>“And then, they’ve kept that burning as an eternal flame ever since in Hiroshima,” he continued. “As far as I know, [UCSB] is the only place in the United States where a Hiroshima peace flame was installed on an outdoor public monument. That’s why it’s so important: it’s a symbol.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Photojournalist and author Steve Winter presented <em>On the Trail of Big Cats: Tigers, Cougars, and Snow Leopards,</em> a chronicle of his work photographing wildlife throughout the world, during a lecture Sunday at UCSB’s Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>During his lecture, Winter presented videos and audio recordings varying from jungles and mountains in Asia to mountain lions living in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“I did not choose big cats, big cats chose me,” Winter said, adding that he tries to tell the animals’ stories through his photographs.</p>\n<p>“If we save big cats, we can help save ourselves,” Winter said. “By saving the large plots of land that wide-ranging predators need to survive, we give them a home, a place to hunt, to mate and a place for the young to disperse. Conservation on such a grand scale radiates outward with global implications.”</p>\n<p>James Livingston, second-year communication major at Santa Barbara Community College, said Winter’s lecture taught him about the dangers of human involvement in natural environments, such as poachers.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know the effect that poachers really had on the environment and how they are tearing everything apart,” Livingston said. “I’m going to do more research on the places that Winter talked about because I’m interested in looking at these foreign places that don’t get much coverage.”</p>\n<p>Winter’s expedition into the wild world of cats highlighted his message that there is a global responsibility to conserve wildlife.</p>\n<p>“The forests are the lungs of the world,” Winter said. “These are the homes of the big cats, providing the air we breathe, pulling carbon from the atmosphere and slowing climate change.”</p>\n<p>“Forests protect the towns and cities around them from flooding, prevent erosion … and provide drinking water for billions of people because forests and grasslands act like sponges,” he continued. “Seventy-five percent of all water in the world comes from forests; 50 percent of the oxygen comes from forests.”</p>\n<p>First-year music and biology double major Maya Gorgas applauded Winter for linking humans and animals.</p>\n<p>“I loved Winter’s spiel on connecting animals and nature with humans and how we are both part of this network where we can both help each other,” Gorgas said.</p>\n<p>Chelsea Brandwein, third-year communication major, said Winter’s presentation of a mountain lion in front of the Hollywood sign projected an interesting contrast between urban and natural environments.</p>\n<p>“My favorite part of the lecture was when Winter presented the picture of the mountain lion with the Hollywood sign in the background because it was an incredibly moving picture that showed the juxtaposition of wildlife and the city,” Brandwein said. “It showed how close we live to wild animals and don’t realize it.”</p>\n<p>Winter urged attendees to understand the ways in which their environment is connected to those of the big cats.</p>\n<p>“I hope these stories and images help to inspire you because where there’s life, there’s hope that the time to act is now,” Winter said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
