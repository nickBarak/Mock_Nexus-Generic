Yang said.</p>\n<p>“With tragedy comes the time to stand strong against the fear and bigotry and stand up for kindness, compassion and open mindedness.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang represented one of the many organizations responsible for co-hosting the event alongside Santa Barbara Hillel. The event was officially titled, “Standing With Pittsburgh Against Hate.”</p>\n<p>Miri Klein, co-director of Chabad at UCSB, also spoke at the memorial and was one of the hosts of the “Mitzvah for Pittsburgh” event in the Arbor on Monday.</p>\n<p>“Love and kindness and goodness are like steel. Hate can try and destroy that, but like steel, goodness and kindness will never be able to be destroyed. And all of us coming here together is proof that love and kindness will always prevail,” she said at the vigil.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer, External Vice President of Local Affairs for Associated Students, closed the ceremony with a reading of the names of the 11 victims and a song in her native language.</p>\n<p>“I think that you can see how the UCSB community was impacted by how many people showed up today. How many people came, of different groups to show support and stand in solidarity. I think that shows the impact that it [the synagogue shooting] made,” Meijer said.</p>\n<p>For some students, this recent tragedy may influence how they choose to vote in the midterms next Tuesday, Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>”When public officials who are trying to fight discrimination, fight gun laws and try to create stricter regulations, it’s going to make things like this happen less often,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s going to eradicate it, but it’s gonna make it happen less.”</p>\n<p>At Chabad’s table in the Arbor on Monday, the organization encouraged students to write down good deeds and add them to a board that they plan on sending to the Jewish community in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Gershon Klein explained that mitzvot, or good deeds, are a way for Jewish people to bring light to the world during times of darkness.</p>\n<p>“A mitzvah can mean different things. One of the main things it means is to be connected… we bring light from the essence of our soul outwards into the revealed world, like right here in Isla Vista,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>One of the mitzvot Gershon performed was wrapping tefillin around the arms of male students. This particular mitzvah is specifically for men, Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“This is a mitzvah which represents being in the oneness of hashem, God, down into the world. We put it opposite the heart, on top of the head, because often, our heart and our head give us different messages. The whole idea of tefillin is to bring oneness, inside of ourselves and in the world,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“So in the place where the biggest friction happens, between our emotions and our mind, we want to bind it and bring oneness to it.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Caduri, an exchange student from Germany, mourned the loss of the United States as a sanctuary for Jewish people. In Europe, Caduri said, synagogues and other Jewish facilities typically have security guards.</p>\n<p>“In the U.S. it was actually quite opposite. When you go there, everything’s open, you can just enter the room because there was no fear of danger so far. So I don’t know how it will change now,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I hope that America will [still] remain a safe place.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-84666\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A 3-D model of Henley Hall shows one of the sides of the building. <em>Courtesy of Henley Hall Model YouTube video</em></p></div>\n<p>Henley Hall, named after its donors Jeff and Judy Henley, will be the new headquarters for the Institute for Energy Efficiency (IEE). It will serve as home to a lecture hall, 17 labs, faculty and administrative offices and a three-story open-air atrium.</p>\n<p>The IEE focuses on the creation of new technologies and methods of energy conservation and sustainability, according to the UCSB Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Enterprises website.</p>\n<p>Henley will be the largest hall at UCSB to date with an estimated at 49,000 gross square feet. It is now in the initial stages of development.</p>\n<p>It will be designed to reduce its water and energy usage, along with its emissions.</p>\n<p>“[Henley Hall] is an outgrowth of our high-priority need for lab and teaching space, and also a recognition of UC Santa Barbara’s leadership in cutting-edge research on energy efficiency,” Leslie Colasse, project manager for Henley Hall, said.</p>\n<p>Henley is designed to maximize space and minimize the carbon footprint the building creates, according to the UCSB Design, Facilities and Safety Services website.</p>\n<p>The building will be composed of mostly steel and concrete with terracotta roof paneling and spires to promote natural shade and cooling.</p>\n<p>Henley is entirely donor funded, with a $56 million budget provided by the Henleys and various other anonymous donors.</p>\n<p>The idea for the new hall came about due to growing class size, restrictive lecture hall capacity and the Institute’s growing impact on the UCSB campus, according to Associated Students (A.S.) President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>“I think it is pretty apparent on campus that there is a shortage of classroom space. The amount of resources UCSB is given, there is still students sitting on the floor… Students [are] taking midterms on floors and that just entirely unacceptable,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>News of Henley first reached the A.S. Main Office after complaints came in about blocked off bike paths around Campbell Hall, she added.</p>\n<p>Henley Hall and the IEE will be the Henleys’s largest gift to UCSB. The Henleys have been involved with the UCSB campus since the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>“Because I spent the majority of my career in the technology industry, my wife and I have been drawn to the terrific STEM programs… at UC Santa Barbara which have achieved national prominence over the decades,” Jeff Henley said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We realized that more and more laboratory space will be critical to attracting and retaining the best faculty as well as the best students for STEM, so this is primarily why we decided to support [Henley Hall].”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

id=\"caption-attachment-84595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AFSCME workers went on strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The October strikes saw thousands of participants statewide, according to a press release sent out by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 spokesperson, John de los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Protestors were joined by students, faculty and members of supporting unions.</p>\n<p>Several politicians, including California State Assembly Member Monique Limón, also came to speak in solidarity.</p>\n<p>“We’re here today because UC has not been able to negotiate a fair contract,” Babe Gonzalez, a medical assistant at UCSB Student Health, said.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez said workers have no protection against emergency layoffs in their contracts, which Gonzales believes is a bigger issue than wage increases.</p>\n<p>“What good is a raise today if they’re not going to guarantee that we would have no emergency layoffs, [that] they won’t be outsourcing our jobs and our job security? You can give us a raise today, and if that’s not in our contract, you can fire us tomorrow,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>The workers who went on strike also expressed concern for their wages in relation to the high cost of living in the Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p>Francisco Garcias, a facilities department worker who has been with UC for 22 years, said the cost of living is a huge issue UC workers face.</p>\n<p>“People have to drive an hour away from their jobs at the university to be able to make rent, to have a home … Our pay does not cover cost of living,” Garcias said.</p>\n<p>University of California Office of the President (UCOP) sent a statement to the Nexus on Wednesday that countered AFSCME demands for increased pay.</p>\n<p>“AFSCME patient care and service workers are already compensated at or above market rates, along with affordable health insurance and generous retirement benefits,” Danielle Smith, UCOP media communications specialist, said in an email.</p>\n<p>“An 8 percent pay increase for each of four years is not possible for taxpayer-supported institutions. The union wants more money – more than any other group at the university. This is why they are striking, plain and simple. AFSCME leaders have done little to truly help their union members.”</p>\n<p>The statement also said AFSCME leaders are hypocritical because AFSCME increased its membership fees in January, raising the monthly dues from $78 to $120.</p>\n<p>“AFSCME leadership has no qualms pointing a finger at UC while choosing to take a larger portion of their members’ paychecks.”</p>\n<p>A Supreme Court decision made in June of this year, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1466_2b3j.pdf\"><em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em></a><em>,</em> made membership dues for California public employee unions optional. The decision barred union collection of fair share fees, meaning that the union’s members are paying voluntarily.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCOP said AFSCME leaders are “spreading false information” about employee displacement.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, the number of patient care employees has increased by 18.9 percent and service workers by 14.4 percent, which is “consistent” with the growth of all union workers by 9.9 percent, Smith said in the UCOP statement.</p>\n<p>“UC hopes AFSCME leaders, given their wasted efforts, will now engage in productive, sensible negotiations, rather than blindly declare victory for a demonstration that moved them no closer to a better deal.”</p>\n<p>Students are also oftentimes confused about whether raising workers’ wages would affect tuition costs, according to Melissa Perez, an on-campus senator for Associated Students (A.S.)</p>\n<p>“I think one of the most common misconceptions about this strike, or why students oppose it, is that they believe that if the workers’ wages go up our tuition has to go up as well,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, the funding to pay for workers’ wages comes from the state’s budget, and our tuition is determined by the Board of Regents. They stand with us when we lobby and strike against tuition hikes, and so we have to stand with them when they’re trying to get a living wage.”</p>\n<p>While the strike did not result in resolved demands, it brought attention to the issues that UC workers face, lead groundskeeper Juan Donato said.</p>\n<p>“The purpose is to voice our concerns and that’s why we [strike],” Donato said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

There, an unprecedented audience of 7,143 green- and gold-clad fans waited not-so patiently to watch their beloved squad take down the reigning champions.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This game was the first time Cal Poly had beaten UCSB since 2000.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ fanbase responded eagerly upon their team’s return home that year, rallying a record-breaking 8,102 people into a packed Harder Stadium for the rematch between the two squads.</p>\n<p>At the time, only few recognized the historic shift in the oppositional dynamic of Cal Poly-Santa Barbara soccer. One of them was the 2006 NCAA Division I National Coach of the Year—a.k.a., UCSB’s very own head coach, Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg’s familiarity with Cal Poly dates back to 1985 when he began playing collegiate soccer for UCSB. Now into his 20th year at the helm of the soccer program, the seasoned coach is able to look back at 30+ years of match-ups and observe the evolution of the rivalrous nature between the programs.</p>\n<p>“We’ve always had kind of a natural rivalry against them because of the location and distance. Even back when I played, it was always a game that we used to always want to play,” Vom Steeg reflects.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s program, however, never quite matched the level of Santa Barbara’s. Before officially meeting UCSB in Big West Conference play in 1996, it made its way through Division II and did not enter Division I until 1994.</p>\n<p>Preoccupied with their in-conference battle with Cal State Northridge for top-seed, the Gauchos paid little attention to the Mustangs’ entering. Vom Steeg recalls, “When they joined Big West…we didn’t think much about Cal Poly.” He acknowledges that Santa Barbara’s “general success” over them fed into the maturing feud.</p>\n<p>Upon the series of events in 2007 as aforementioned, however, the rivalry escalated to a level beyond prediction.</p>\n<p>Over the years, it has materialized into packed stadiums and rowdy crowds, distasteful screaming of ironic slogans like “Cuck Fal Poly”, and an ungodly amount of tortillas thrown-to-waste.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg carefully makes an important distinction between how the UCSB-Cal Poly rivalry takes form at Alex. G. Spanos Stadium versus that at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“The fans up at Cal Poly…are there mainly to…have a big party. They turn it…a little bit more into just an event that you get a bunch of people together and scream and yell,” he states matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>For a number of reasons, traveling to Cal Poly is hardly an enjoyable experience for the team. The close quartered football-turned-soccer field subjects them to audible criticisms from thousands of hovering fans.</p>\n<p>Up in SLO, Vom Steeg continues, “The referees are usually more emotional. The last two years we’ve had water bottles thrown at us. If you happen to lose the game, [the fans] jump over the side…It’s really hard to play naturally [and]…easy to make it hard to play soccer.”</p>\n<p>Silencing the infamous crowd remains one of his most memorable moments at Spanos Stadium. In 2009, senior Chris Pontius scored seconds into double overtime to win the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“The whole place was just absolutely quiet. Chris ran around the whole stadium, we were chasing him as he was celebrating, and the whole place was dead quiet,” he gladly recounted.</p>\n<p>In the coach’s eyes, Harder Stadium harbors a much more authentic environment for the team. The professional-like layout opens up the field while separating the players from the overwhelming crowds.</p>\n<p>He mostly appreciates the fans’—comprised of both students and locals—knowledge of the actual game, noting, “It feels like a soccer game. The cheering is about good plays on the field,” as compared to screaming about the opponent’s mistakes.</p>\n<p>This aspect, among others, was one of the driving factors in Vom Steeg’s decision in 1999 to take control of a struggling program that had, in the season prior to his arrival, merely two wins and 17 losses to its name.</p>\n<p>Ironically, Vom Steeg’s first time coaching UCSB was against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>20 years later, the accomplished coach has deep-rooted ties to Santa Barbara and holds some of the biggest accolades in collegiate soccer.</p>\n<p>He is a two-time NCSAA National Coach of the Year and a five-time Big West Coach of the Year. Under the reigns of Vom Steeg, UCSB made it into the Sweet 16 of NCAA four times and even hosted and won an NCAA Championship along the way.</p>\n<p>Talking about the essential creation of and dedication to the soccer program, Vom Steeg notes,</p>\n<p>“The big key for me has been the amount of work, the energy we’ve put in, the relationships we developed. The idea of starting over again has kept me from looking [at other options]. I’d rather keep enjoying what we’ve built here, and I still think there’s room for us to get better.”</p>\n<p>More specifically, this hard work has contributed to the establishment of Santa Barbara’s winning record over Cal Poly; one that, as of recently however, has begun to deteriorate.</p>\n<p>Now awaiting the 41st matchup, Vom Steeg hopes to break the sense of complacency that has overwhelmed the Gauchos’ gameplay in the past years. Upon the hiring of former US National coach Steve Sampson, Cal Poly has strategically and effectively dulled the matchups against their blue and gold rival. The result? Four straight draws at Harder Stadium since 2014, the latest two finalizing with scores of 0-0.</p>\n<p>To rationalize SLO’s gameplay, Vom Steeg points out, “When you get caught in a situation where maybe you’re not sure your talent matches up, you do things on the field to make it really hard to play.”</p>\n<p>He continues, “It’s up to us this year to, more than ever, try to figure out how we can make it into a more exciting soccer game than what it’s been.”</p>\n<p>Coach Tim Vom Steeg hopes to disrupt this pattern of stagnancy with a sweet victory over the Mustangs. After all, the win could be the 258th of his career, 24th against their program, and the key to unleashing the prideful insanity that the community has so eagerly awaited to display.</p><div

Gessesse</em></p></div>\n<p>The North Hall Takeover of 1968 led to the creation of the Black Studies department, which now offers a diverse set of courses encompassing traditional subjects like the history of black Americans as well as more specialized courses detailing Caribbean studies, the black radical tradition and the history of jazz music.</p>\n<p>Professor Jeffrey Stewart, who works in the department and helped organize the North Hall Takeover: 50 Years After conference that took place at UC Santa Barbara earlier this month, is proud of the growth the department has seen since its creation.</p>\n<p>“We feel that our very existence here is due to their vision and their activism, so we try to honor that with these anniversary celebrations,” Stewart said.</p>\n<p>The creation of the Black Studies department also set the groundwork for other departments such as the Chicanx Studies department, the Feminist Studies department and the Asian American Studies department.</p>\n<p>“There’s a body of knowledge that’s come out of the black experience of America that all students can benefit from and there’s a body of knowledge that’s come out of the Chicano experience of America that can be useful for all students,” Stewart said.</p>\n<p>Stewart cites a “critical apparatus” and activism as the two leading tenets of the Black Studies department.</p>\n<p>Not only does the department teach its students to be critical consumers of the information presented to them, but it also emphasizes the need for activism and the role it’s played in creating the America we live in today, he said.</p>\n<p>“Activism sometimes is looked down on in the larger political landscape but I think if you look at change in America, much of it has come about because people have been activists,” he said.</p>\n<p>Despite its growth, the department is currently struggling with a shortage of professors.</p>\n<p>While Stewart said the problem is mostly temporary due to professors who have passed away or recently left, he said the larger problem is the lack of attention to the humanities as a whole.</p>\n<p>“The university is internationally known for its science and engineering, so that’s kind of what they’re always emphasizing,” said Stewart said.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to interdisciplinary departments like black studies, feminist studies… sometimes it’s a struggle to get administrators to see that part of the education here is not just getting technical education, it’s education to become a citizen, and to be a globally aware citizen.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has a long history of activism, particularly within the Black Student Union (BSU).</p>\n<p>BSU students are currently working to update the demands from 2012 and cite their two biggest concerns as the resources available for black educators and the “recruitment and retention of black students,” according to BSU Chair Mariyah Lewis.</p>\n<p>“Seeing how the office engages with the retention and recruitment of black students… is one of the indicative efforts of how strong and how serious the demands are, ranging from 1968 all the way to 2012,” said Alexandra Gessesse, whose position in the Office of Admissions as diversity intern was a direct result of previous BSU demands.</p>\n<p>Dalton Nezey, one of the original members of the North Hall Takeover, echoed similar sentiments in establishing strong, consistent professors in the Black Studies department.</p>\n<p>“I wanted [the professors] to be caretakers of the history of black studies and the history of blacks on this campus,” Nezey said.</p>\n<p>Samantha Sanchez, who is leading the seven-member BSU demands team, says most of the demands have received money allocated toward their completion.</p>\n<p>The team is now responsible for making sure the money is used correctly.</p>\n<p>The demands are constantly evolving, as the needs of black students at UCSB evolve, and Sanchez says the main goal of the demands team is to “assess the state of the black community on campus.”</p>\n<p>“What we have left right now is just to ensure the overall well-being of black students and black people on campus,” she added.</p>\n<p>The addition of two black psychologists in Counseling and Psychological Services and the creation of the diversity intern position in the Admissions Office are two of the demands from 2012 that have already been met.</p>\n<p>There are still many demands left incomplete, however, including one asking for a display in North Hall memorializing the North Hall Takeover and a database of contact information for black students to allow for faculty or BSU leaders to “extend resources to our community more systematically and rigorously,” according to the 2012 demands.</p>\n<p>“I think that the things that we’re implementing will allow for us to see change happen in a very institutional and lasting way,” Sanchez said. “I’m excited to see where it goes after I graduate.”</p>\n<p><i>A

Individuals from all ten UC campuses and their respective medical centers are marching in protest.</p>\n<p>Since AFSCME representatives are spread across the state, their presence at UCSB wasn’t as large as the previous workers’ strike this past May, according to Cierra Sorin, Graduate Student Association (GSA) president.</p>\n<p>“The purpose today is to send a clear message about consciousness and awareness, and to spread our voices about what we want the university to know,” said Juan Donato, head groundskeeper at UCSB and AFSCME strike organizer.</p>\n<p>Employees across UCSB showed their support for the strike throughout the week.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“We demand their labor and then demean them for that kind of labor. And it’s really hypocritical and really elitist.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jay Stemmle, Student Academic Skills Specialist for Campus Learning Assistant Services (CLAS), spoke during the rally on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“This is what my boss wrote to me yesterday: ‘Jay, not showing up for your scheduled shift is not protected speech… If you fail to report to work, it will be considered insubordination/serious misconduct, and your actions will be subject to discipline.’”</p>\n<p>Because of this, she decided to further research the rights of the employees who are on strike.</p>\n<p>She found that as long an an employee’s contract does not explicitly condemn participating in solidarity strikes, then striking is within their legal right, according to SCIU vs. Fresno In Home Supportive Services Authority from 2015.</p>\n<p>Stemmle told the crowd about this decision, hoping to educate UCSB employees who were unaware of their rights.</p>\n<p>“If [there are] other people in that situation, I want us to be able to find each other, strategize, talk to each other, get each other the help we need,” she said.</p>\n<p>Cathy Murillo, mayor of Santa Barbara, spoke at the rally on Wednesday afternoon in support of AFSCME’s action against UCSB.</p>\n<p>Murillo emphasized her personal connection to the strike as she spoke — her grandmother worked in the garment district in Los Angeles and was an organizer for the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union.</p>\n<p>“You deserve a salary that respects the hard work that you do. I’ll send some little fairy-vibes up to the Regents, for them to look at the good people here, and give you a good contract, the contract you deserve. I’m here for you today, folks,” she said.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"84533\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/afscme-protests-ucs-lack-of-action-during-second-day-of-strike-hundreds-show-up-in-support/screen-shot-2018-10-25-at-12-13-09-am-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?fit=1916%2C1267&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1916,1267\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-10-25 at 12.13.09 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?fit=888%2C587&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84533\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=888%2C587\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"587\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?w=1916&amp;ssl=1 1916w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=1024%2C677&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Numerous student groups showed up to support the workers during the strike.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen five or six teaching assistants in my department, including some who are holding sections right now. I’ve seen a couple of our professors bring their classes out,” Sorin said.</p>\n<p>One of these TAs was Amanda Rodriguez, a second-year graduate student studying sociology with an emphasis in feminist studies. She brought her students to the rally on Wednesday to observe the strikers and ask questions.</p>\n<p>“As a GSA member, the GSA executive board stands firmly behind AFSCME, and as a United Auto Workers (UAW) member I stand firmly behind them, and UC needs to know we’re watching, we care, and we’re willing to mobilize on [AFSCME’s] behalf,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>The issue of workers’ rights carries personal significance for many students who marched on Tuesday and Wednesday, including Frances Olague, a third-year psychology major.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coming to these ever since I was a little kid because my mom works for UC Berkeley. It’s really close to home since my mom is a UC worker, and I feel like with their petitions and everything, how it goes through affects my life as well,” Olague said.</p>\n<p>Despite the strong student support present throughout the strike, some students were still in opposition. Their criticism is often centered around the workers’ lack of higher education or seemingly self-chosen job choice.</p>\n<p>“There was definitely people that didn’t seem too happy with [the strike], but I was happy to be out here, and I was happy to see as many students as there was out here as well,” said June Mihalich, a sociology major in her last quarter.</p>\n<p>One post on UCSB’s Free &amp; For Sale group on Facebook mentioned a UCSB student telling the demonstrators to be quiet because she had midterms and yelling at them to “fuck off.”</p>\n<p>Dozens of commenters argued whether the girl’s reactions were valid.</p>\n<p>“We demand our McDonald’s so fast, but we shame those workers when they ask to at least be able to get a living wage. We demand their labor and then demean them for that kind of labor. And it’s really hypocritical and really elitist to say that,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Leaders of the strike emphasized that it takes the combined action of students, employees and workers to make an impact that UCSB administrators cannot ignore.</p>\n<p>“As union workers, let’s stick together. Together, we will make this work, together we will win,” Donato said.</p>\n<p>The AFSCME strike will continue on Thursday, Oct. 25 until 6 p.m. at Storke Tower.</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.1 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Quarter 2017 after Santa Barbara Judge Thomas P. Anderle ruled that the school violated the due process requirements of the federal and state constitutions by pre-determining John’s guilt, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>“Instead of making that decision based upon facts, the law, and in fairness, [UCSB] has decided to do it their own way,” Anderle wrote in court documents.</p>\n<p>A separate panel of UCSB administrators reviewed the case in May 2018 and ultimately cleared him of all charges. The court ruled on Oct. 23 that John would be awarded court costs of $4,714.91.</p>\n<p>In its decision, the panel found that, “had the University considered available evidence at the inception of the case… John Doe’s suspension and charges probably would not have occured.”</p>\n<p>The panel “chastised” UCSB for “its failure to conduct even a rudimentary investigation before charging,” said Bob Ottilie, John’s attorney.</p>\n<p>As of October 2018, John is attending a different university.</p>\n<p>This is the third case the Nexus has reported on in recent months <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\">involving</a> the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/sb-superior-court-reverses-ucsb-students-suspension-for-sexual-assault/\">reversal</a> of a Title IX case.</p>\n<p>John, a San Diego resident, was initially suspended after his former high school girlfriend, referred to as Jane Doe in court documents, posted a video online after an argument between the two.</p>\n<p>Both were 17 years of age and living in San Diego at the time of the alleged argument on Aug. 13, 2016. John was enrolled at UCSB at that time, but had not yet officially begun attending classes.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, John and Jane got into an argument over his private social media accounts. When John saw his girlfriend recording the argument, there was a “scuffle for the phone,” court documents stated.</p>\n<p>His girlfriend “left an impression” in the video that John hit her. John denied that he threatened or hit her.</p>\n<p>After an unaffiliated UCSB student saw the video on Jane’s public Twitter account and reported it to UCSB, University of California Police Department (UCPD) detectives from UCSB drove down to San Diego and arrested John. He was placed in a juvenile detention facility in San Diego.</p>\n<p>John was later released into the custody of his mother on Sep. 2 after a judge found that he was not a threat to anyone.</p>\n<p>UCPD did not inform the San Diego Police Department of John’s case, making this the first case in the country where an arrest was ordered by the Title IX office, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Ottilie called UCSB’s charges and behavior “outrageous” in a press release sent out Thursday.</p>\n<p>“The University suspended this poor kid in September 2016, and totally barred him from campus, and then failed to even initiate a meaningful Title IX investigation for months,” Ottilie said in a press release.</p>\n<p>“This was what so offended the court; his suspension was tied to an investigation that initially never went forward, and when it did, he was totally exonerated. Why did it take 19 months when the University never presented any evidence that it did not have 19 months earlier.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

uncertainty of move-in, we are removing those temporary spaces.”</p>\n<p>The higher enrollment in FSSP is consistent with a higher enrollment rate for freshmen overall. As more students accept offers to attend UCSB, the amount of students who need on-campus housing increases.</p>\n<p>Because of this, the number of triples offered in San Nicolas grows year by year, according to Hurd.</p>\n<p>Spaces in the rooms were also left open for international students and emergency room situations, according to Hurd. Now, three weeks into the quarter, those vacancies are being addressed.</p>\n<p>The Department of Residential and Community Living finished accommodating all the students on the waiting list last week, meaning that the remaining vacancies in San Nicolas Hall would not be filled.</p>\n<p>For some students, this meant that those who originally requested triples now find themselves in double rooms.</p>\n<p>Residents who requested triples for financial reasons and found themselves in doubles were left with few options when notified of the de-tripling.</p>\n<p>It is within the right of UCSB to change a resident’s rooming situation from a double to a triple, or vice versa, at any time, according to the University Residence Hall Contract.</p>\n<p>“When one student vacates due to reassignment or termination of contract, the room reverts to a double occupancy room and the rate for the two remaining students increases to the double occupancy rate,” the housing contract reads.</p>\n<p>The estimated cost difference between a double and triple room for these residents totals $1675: $375 for the remainder of fall quarter, and $650 per quarter for winter and spring.</p>\n<p>Since all empty beds in previously-tripled rooms were removed from San Nicolas, affected residents are left with two options if they need to remain in a triple: a roommate swap or a residence hall switch.</p>\n<p>A roommate swap is when students communicate with other residents in the building who have a double room preference and swap rooms with them, Assistant Resident Director of San Nicolas Residence Hall Ruth Quintanilla said in an email.</p>\n<p>“This would allow you to move into a triple and switch with resident who wants a double,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>Both of these residents would fill out roommate swap forms and the resident being detripled could avoid paying the cost of a double room.</p>\n<p>For William Cui, a first-year statistical science major, a roommate swap led to finally getting the triple room type he originally requested. Cui and his roommate intended on being in a double, but due to over-enrollment of FSSP, were placed in a triple.</p>\n<p>“[We] were all set with a double until a few days before we moved in they told us we were stuck with a random third roommate,” Cui said in an email.</p>\n<p>“They had only sent out the original email notifying us about the possibility of doubles being turned into triples a week or so before our move in date.”</p>\n<p>As other rooms were being de-tripled, Cui connected with the Resident Director to switch rooms with two students who needed a triple for financial reasons.</p>\n<p>“We successfully switched with them so we live in a double now and the two people we switched with live in our old room with the third roommate we got assigned to. Our FSSP experience would have just been a lot better in general if we had gotten our double as originally planned and trying to move out was really tedious and stressful,” he added.</p>\n<p>While Cui and his roommate agreed to switch rooms, others who originally requested doubles but were placed in triples may not be as eager to do a roommate swap.</p>\n<p>For residents being de-tripled who cannot find residents to swap with, there is a second option: a residence hall switch, where a resident in a de-tripled room has the option of moving out of the building and into a different residence hall altogether. This process is facilitated by the resident director of San Nicolas Hall.</p>\n<p>Quintanilla said that if the switch from paying for a triple to paying for a double posed a concern for students, then they could file a Cost of Attendance appeal to the Office of Financial Aid.</p>\n<p>An email from University and Community Housing Services clarified that this option is only “for students who have expenses that supersede the budget allocation for rent.”</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.5 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

student benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The defaulted payments have also caused students to be unable to register as academic student employees or graduate student researchers, according to Head Steward of the United Auto Worker (UAW) local 2865, Andrew Elrod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When class and tuition fees remain unpaid, students face being dropped from their classes and losing benefits such as parking and bus passes, said Avi McClelland, one of the UAW 2865 Head Stewards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW 2865 is the union responsible for representing student workers on the UCSB campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to being unable to register as academic student employees or graduate student researchers, graduate students have been unable to register as instructors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who were originally supposed to be teaching assistants have faced delays in changing their titles, leaving instructors unable to access course management platforms. Their students, in turn, are unable to access several tools, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elrod said there is a “variety of benefits” that employees get, but the lack of registration has resulted in them not receiving the benefits to which they are entitled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UAW 2865 and Graduate Student Association (GSA) have been working together in an attempt to help students avoid losing benefits and payment for their work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve written up a collective survey together that we’ve been circulating on our list serves, sending to our department reps in GSA on Facebook, trying to get as many graduate students as possible who are having issues to respond to it,” GSA President Cierra Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Student workers] should also recognize that the only way to speak to the university as an equal would be through… [a] collective response,” Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCPath malfunction has also affected undergraduate students who work within the school as tutors or readers, according to Daniel Lazar, one of the UAW 2865 Head Stewards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union stated that they are working closely with the GSA to make sure students do not feel as though they are isolated and to make sure the university upholds their end of the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The larger issue is whether students will band together to bring attention to the issue, Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lazar also expressed frustration over the university’s lack of quick and detailed responses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’ve just been stonewalling and haven’t responded. I’ve actually gotten contradictory information about the causes of the error… It’s clearly a university-wide problem, and there hasn’t been a university-wide response to it,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Union objected to the transition to UCPath from the start because these issues had already occurred at other universities last year. Despite this, the university proceeded with the transition, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the issues are not resolved soon, UCPath members will not receive their October paychecks, leaving students unsure of their ability to pay rent, according to McClelland.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.6 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84532\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84532\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/","id":2196,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2195,2194,2193],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Decedent Found on Camino Del Sur Beach Identified as UCSB Student","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2018-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"There are no obvious signs of foul play.

id=\"caption-attachment-84481\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AFSCME workers and supporters marched around the UCSB campus several times. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 represents more than 24,000 employees across California.</p>\n<p>AFSCME initially <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-12/afscme-votes-to-strike-uslac-ucsb-plans-in-solidarity/\">announced</a> its intention to strike on Oct. 12 following a vote in which 96 percent of AFSCME workers authorized a strike, according to a press release sent out by the union.</p>\n<p>“UC is trying to force workers to get by with much less than what’s necessary to provide for our families while lining the pockets of its top brass with excessive salaries, lavish perks and secret slush funds,” Kathryn Lybarger, AFSCME Local 3299 president, said in a press release.</p>\n<p>“By shortchanging workers, UC is also shortchanging the students, patients and communities who depend on us. The university is demanding less security and more inequality for tens of thousands of its workers, and that is completely at odds with its promise to ‘pioneer a better future’ for California.”</p>\n<p>Today’s protests at UCSB were part of a much bigger UC-wide demonstration that encompasses all 10 campuses.</p>\n<p>Protestors will strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. They will hold rallies from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. each day under Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>Nothing has improved for AFSCME workers since the last demonstration, according to Bill Fitzpatrick, campus representative of University Professional &amp; Technical Employees (UPTE).</p>\n<p>UPTE workers are striking this week in solidarity with AFSCME.</p>\n<p>“The university has now forced [the workers] to accept the terms of the university’s offers without the benefit of any more negotiations,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>Fitzpatrick, who represents 1,040 people in UPTE and voices their concerns to UC administration, has spent the past year and a half traveling to various UC campuses to bargain for workers’ conditions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“Students usually think of custodian staff or groundskeepers as ‘ghost people.’ They don’t want to see them, they just want to see the product of their work.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UCSB workers are among the lowest paid in the system, despite the high cost of living associated with the Santa Barbara area, Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>“Nobody is asking for an outrageous paycheck. We have a couple of titles here where the potential pay is 52 percent lower than the UC Davis campus for the same job titles. We are demanding an explanation of why that would be fair to us, why we are among the lowest paid campuses.”</p>\n<p>For Esther Ramirez, a senior custodian in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall for the past 15 years, the future of UC workers’ conditions remains unclear.</p>\n<p>“It’s the second strike; I don’t know what is next,” Ramirez said. “It’s hard because I’m a single mom, and my family of three needs to take other jobs to support the family.”</p>\n<p>According to a UC worker who asked to remain anonymous, UC employees are often considered invisible.</p>\n<p>“Students usually think of custodian staff or groundskeepers as ‘ghost people.’ They don’t want to see them, they just want to see the product of their work.”</p>\n<p>Dozens of UC Santa Barbara students, as well as several professors, were among the workers on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Shelsea Sanchez, a second-year political science major and student worker in the dining commons, said she felt the need to support her coworkers in the demonstration.</p>\n<p>“I see and interact with these workers on a daily basis and see how the UC is super exploitative when it comes to working conditions,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I have to use my voice as a student to come out and represent those people who can’t talk for themselves.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez is hopeful more students will gather for the protests on Wednesday and Thursday, adamant that students have a unique platform to advocate for reform.</p>\n<p>”Everybody here loves working at their jobs and would love to stay here. But if the UC can’t make it affordable to where we can’t afford to work at a UC and live in the Santa Barbara area, a lot of people aren’t able to stay with us,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>“We would love to come to terms with a fair contract and get back to work without this distraction.”</p>\n<p>Further <em>Nexus</em> coverage for the strike can be viewed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1054710350061301763\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

He was officially suspended for eight quarters following a hearing from the Sexual/Interpersonal Violence Conduct Committee.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, the SB Superior Court court found that Doe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>was denied access to critical evidence – a copy of a report that described Roe’s alleged injuries following the assault – during the hearing;</li>\n<li>was denied the opportunity to “adequately cross-examine witnesses,” including Roe herself and Doe’s mother, among others;</li>\n<li>and was denied the opportunity to present evidence, such as information regarding Roe’s antidepressant medication, in his defense.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“It is ironic that an institution of higher learning, where American history and government are taught, should stray so far from the principles that underlie our democracy,” court documents read.</p>\n<p>Doe will be rewarded some form of compensation, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\">second reversal</a> of a UCSB Title IX case the <em>Nexus</em> has reported on in recent months.</p>\n<p><strong>JANE ROE</strong></p>\n<p>Roe said Doe sexually assaulted her that night at Doe’s girlfriend’s apartment. Doe’s girlfriend is referred to in court documents as Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p>Roe had consumed wine, beer and mango margaritas that night and said she had felt “pretty drunk” and decided to sleep on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed in the apartment’s living room.</p>\n<p>She stated she woke at an unknown time, “completely disoriented,” to an “intense, throbbing pain.”</p>\n<p>Roe said she pretended to be asleep because she did not want a confrontation while her assaulter allegedly “unhooked [her] bra”; “suck[ed] and bit” her for several minutes; “[took] photos of her naked breasts” and repeatedly “penetrated [her] vagina and anus” with his fingers and/or penis.</p>\n<p>She said she realized it was Doe when her assaulter stopped and got up from the bed, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Roe was medically examined by the Santa Barbara County Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) two days after the alleged assault.</p>\n<p>The SART report said there was “bruising and laceration noted in the anal area,” according to University of California Police Department (UCPD) Detective Dawn Arviso.</p>\n<p>However, neither Roe nor the detective provided a full copy of the SART report with this information attached during the trial.</p>\n<p>“The SART report was critical evidence,” court documents state. “At a minimum UCSB should have required the detective to provide a complete copy of the SART report.”</p>\n<p>Roe’s story that night also conflicted with Eyewitness One’s report.</p>\n<p>Following the alleged assault, Roe said Eyewitness One approached the bed and screamed when she saw that Roe’s “bottom half” was completely bare.</p>\n<p>Eyewitness One testified over Skype that Roe was wearing a short-sleeve shirt and underwear when she got up from the bed, contradicting Roe’s claim. She also denied screaming.</p>\n<p>The mattress was also absent of “any visible signs or smells of bodily fluids” consistent with anal or vaginal penetration, according to Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p><strong>JOHN DOE</strong></p>\n<p>Doe denied all of Roe’s accusations.</p>\n<p>He said he arrived at the apartment at approximately 12:30 a.m. that night and was “very intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>By Eyewitness One’s recommendation, he lay down, fully dressed, on the bottom bunk next to Roe because the top bunk was covered in luggage. He reportedly first heard about Doe’s allegations when she “woke [him] up by basically yelling about someone hurting her.”</p>\n<p>He argued three main points in his defense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The distance between the couch and the bunk bed in the living room was too close for him to have done anything without being noticed by Eyewitness One and Eyewitness Two.</li>\n<li>He could not have unhooked Roe’s bra because his neurological disorder, a “form of palsy,” affects his motor skills when he is tired or drunk.</li>\n<li>Roe’s antidepressant medication, Viibryd, has side effects including hallucinations, sleep paralysis and night terrors, which can become severe when mixed with alcohol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doe was not allowed to include the antidepressant medication evidence in his defense because he did not have an expert present, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>The SB Superior Court stated he was not given enough time to find an expert, again showing a lack of due process.</p>\n<p>The full court documents can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/B283229.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
