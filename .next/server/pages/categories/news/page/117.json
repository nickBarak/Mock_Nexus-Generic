Staff Assistance Program (ASAP) Senior Consultant and Psychologist Beth Cohen will hold a discussion on psychological healing titled “The Impact of the Isla Vista Tragedy: One Year Later” Wednesday and Thursday at noon in the University Center in preparation for the upcoming anniversary of the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>In these discussions, Cohen will explore the lasting impacts of trauma on the I.V. and UCSB communities and different types of healing processes individuals may experience.</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, the discussion will focus on the community-wide and individual reactions to traumatic events.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to do a lot of education about post-traumatic stress disorder, about how trauma can affect people and they don’t even know it, some of the research around trauma and then ways of healing,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Cohen said she encourages I.V. and UCSB community members to recognize the long-lasting effects of trauma.</p>\n<p>“To give you an idea, there are a number of cases right now that I am working where actual people, faculty and staff specifically, are having trouble working and didn’t know why,” Cohen said. “Truth was that they were traumatized and they didn’t know it. The important thing is that education around trauma is vital … trauma is very treatable.”</p>\n<p>Cohen aims to help those affected by the events of May 23 last year understand their emotions are normal, ASAP Coordinator John Berberet said.</p>\n<p>“It’s our way of helping people come to terms with it or help people find some meaning and moving on, not in the spirit of forgetting or disregarding, but to find some meaning and understanding,” Cohen said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The important thing is that education around trauma is vital … trauma is very treatable. – Psychologist Beth Cohen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Berberet said one goal of the discussion is to help the individuals understand repressed emotions that may surface during the week of May 23.</p>\n<p>“People that experience and examine trauma in the past in another part of their life — some of that stuff can get stirred up again when another traumatic event happens,” Berberet said.</p>\n<p>Berberet said he anticipates that the first anniversary of the events of May 23 last year will be difficult for I.V. and UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Especially with the first anniversary, there’s something about our human nature we sort of reassess and reexamine what is going on in our lives that we to have memorialize to help us heal,” Berberet said.</p>\n<p>Berberet said I.V. residents and UCSB students, staff and faculty have found unique ways of healing since May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“Wonderful people are finding … ways of dealing or finding memorials or rituals that are moving forward for the community,” Berberet said.</p>\n<p><em>ASAP encourages faculty and staff to attend one of the two sessions and also welcomes students to the discussion, in addition to the services Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) will continue to offer throughout the week.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Richard Martinez, father of victim Christopher Michaels-Martinez, and Bob Weiss, father of victim Veronika Weiss, both spoke and held a Q&amp;A session at the event to share their experiences since the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>Martinez said, as a member of pro-gun control organization Everytown for Gun Safety, he does not wish to ban guns, but rather to reduce gun-related violence and crime.</p>\n<p>“I grew up with guns … Everytown and me personally, we’re not anti-guns, we’re anti-gun violence,” Martinez said. “I’m not out to ban guns from people who are responsible citizens. I want to make sure as much as possible that dangerous people don’t have guns.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said he wants to ensure criminal background checks are carried out, and improve existing background checks to prevent dangerous individuals from acquiring guns.</p>\n<p>“The most effective thing we can do to end gun violence in this country is to have criminal background checks on all gun sales,” Martinez said. “We have criminal checks on gun sales in California, but we need to do better. We need to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers and people who are seriously mentally ill.”</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, states that require criminal background checks before gun purchases see less gun-related crimes.</p>\n<p>“In states that have criminal checks for gun sales, fewer women are killed with guns, fewer law enforcement officers are killed on duty and fewer people commit suicide,” Martinez said. “The I.V. shooter had a long history of serious mental illness. We need to improve our background check system to make sure that the information gets into the background check.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said studies show while 1,171,177 Americans in total have died from the nation’s past wars, an even greater number of Americans have died due to gunfire, with 1,384,171 recorded between the years 1968 and 2012.</p>\n<p>“PBS commentator Mark Shields made the following statement, ‘More Americans have been killed by gunfire since 1968 than in all the wars in the nation’s history,’ and he made the statement on December 2012,” Martinez said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63567\" style=\"width: 351px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63567\" data-attachment-id=\"63567\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/richard-martinez-shares-his-story-about-how-gun-violence-has-affected-his-life/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431915085\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-63567\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=341%2C227\" alt=\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life.

How has that become acceptable?”</p>\n<p>Weiss said he will attend the UC Board of Regents meeting on May 20 at UC San Francisco to advocate for UC divestment from businesses that produce guns.</p>\n<p>“On Thursday I will be at the Board of Regents meeting at UCSF presenting petitions from students about divestiture,” Weiss said. “University of California is invested in weapons manufacturing. They’re actually taking your money and investing it in companies that make guns. And when I heard about that, I had to get involved.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said since the events of May 23 last year, he has helped pass “red flag legislation” which allows individuals to report cases if they feel threatened by someone near to them and potentially confiscate guns and other weapons from suspects if a judge agrees there may be danger.</p>\n<p>“Red Flag Legislation allows immediate family members or law enforcement, if they believe that a loved one is a danger to themselves or others, they can go take that evidence before a judge and if the judge agrees, the judge can order that the person return any weapons they have and prohibit that person from buying more weapons,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>Martinez said he hopes to add a checklist in police reports to be completed by officers and deputies in the case of domestic violence or mental stability investigations, and to ensure officials inform those involved of the Red Flag Legislation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we took the second amendment literally, it’s the right to keep and bear arms, each one of us would have the right to keep a tank in our backyard and nobody understands it in that way. – Richard Martinez</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The domestic violence addendum to police reports is a checklist for officers to make sure they did everything in a domestic violence situation,” Martinez said. “I’ve talked to Sheriff Brown about doing a checklist about somebody’s mental stability, and one thing I’d like to have on the checklist is the red flag legislation.”</p>\n<p>Weiss said Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department (SBCSD) should have performed a more thorough welfare check on the shooter on April 30, questioning whether he was in possession of guns.</p>\n<p>“There’s a question in a threat assessment that should be on [Richard Martinez’s] checklist, and according to the FBI they are preventing mass shootings right now by always asking this question,” Weiss said. “This wasn’t asked of the Isla Vista monster; no one asked him if he had a gun. One thing police officers are trained in is having a sense of when someone’s lying to them.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said some gun lobbyists believe a higher power and the second amendment under the Constitution, the right to keep and bear arms, warrant their desire to have a gun anywhere at any time.</p>\n<p>“They feel the second amendment guarantees them the absolute right to carry a gun at any time and any place,” Martinez said. “Some say we have a God-given right. Although I’m not a biblical scholar but … I’m puzzled by that one.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the second amendment and other rights under the Constitution are not absolute, and there are certain exceptions to the right of possessing weapons.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have absolute right of free speech, you can’t go onto a crowded movie theater and yell ‘fire,’ you can’t threaten to kill somebody,” Martinez said. “You don’t have the absolute right to practice religion — you can’t engage in human sacrifice. If we took the second amendment literally, it’s the right to keep and bear arms, each one of us would have the right to keep a tank in our backyard and nobody understands it in that way.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63568\" style=\"width: 351px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63568\" data-attachment-id=\"63568\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/bob-weiss-talks-about-his-professional-relationship-with-richard-martinez/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431916025\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"128\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-63568\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?resize=341%2C227\" alt=\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Weiss said he disagrees with gun lobbyists, and the second amendment is not necessarily applicable in modern-day as it was written at a time when newly independent American civilians required a way to defend themselves against the English.</p>\n<p>“The gun lobbyist’s arguments are all bullshit,” Weiss said. “The second amendment — it was written to protect us from the British who were apt to invade our shores anytime because we didn’t have a proper army to take them on. It didn’t have anything to do with protecting yourself from robbers.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said another stance taken by gun lobbyists is to solve gun violence by increasing the number of guns, which according to Martinez is an outdated resolution.</p>\n<p>“The second argument that you hear is that the solution to gun violence in our country is more guns,” Martinez said. “That suggestion is a 1800’s solution to a 21st century problem. We can do better. What the heck are you supposed to do with a gun during Deltopia? It just doesn’t make sense.”</p>\n<p>Weiss said while I.V. is seen as an “idyllic place,” there are several problems, including high crime, in the college town that must be addressed.</p>\n<p>“It’s a beautiful place … everyone’s pretending, ‘Oh, it’s by the ocean and the sun shines and everybody’s happy,’” Weiss said. “Deltopia draws in thousands of high school and college kids. You can’t do that in most cities; you would get shut down a long time ago. This town is a big damn mess, it needs to be cleaned up.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Adriana Marquez-Gallegos attended the talk and said she is in favor of gun safety laws and hopes to look into more legislations against gun violence.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was really informative and it opened up my eyes to gun violence,” Marquez-Gallegos said. “It could have been any one of my friends or myself, and you just never know. I think I would look into gun laws we can pass and more voting.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Scotty O’Brien said he is concerned more gun safety laws will remove the weapons from the possession of responsible entities and contribute to a black market for guns to be accessed by dangerous individuals.</p>\n<p>“While I believe that so-called common sense safety laws can make us less safe, I do recognize that the increased prevalence of firearms in the community results in more shootings,” O’Brien said. “More safety laws mean less people are able to purchase firearms through the legal market. The black market for guns is just like with drugs, just expands and expands and turns into a whole messy organized crime situation.”</p>\n<p>O’Brien said, while decreasing the amount of guns could decrease gun-related issues, it may not contribute to lower violence overall because other types of weapons are available.</p>\n<p>“More guns, same amount of violence, the violence won’t go away — it’s just a matter of how one chooses to defend or not defend themselves,” O’Brien said.</p>\n<p>Martinez said UCSB students and the youth population in general should take a stance on gun violence and promote safety measures that will inevitably affect them.</p>\n<p>“Don’t ever kid yourself that it can’t happen to you. When the I.V. shooter left his apartment, he went out to kill. He had over 600 rounds left,” Martinez said. “So, you have a choice, you can forget about it and go on and continue to enjoy your lives here and pretend it won’t happen again, or you can do something about it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-63496\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rally participants protested underneath Storke Tower in response to UC President Janet Napolitano’s plans to raise tuition over the next five years. <em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Office of the External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) held a rally in front of Storke Tower on Friday to conclude the week-long “We’re fUCked” campaign to protest the proposed UC system tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>​Speakers voiced frustration regarding UC President Janet Napolitano’s proposed Long-Term Stability Plan for Tuition and Financial Aid, which plans to raise tuition by five percent annually for the next five years. Students also criticized Napolitano’s proposed state budget revisal to freeze tuition until the 2017–2018 school year. At the conclusion of the event, attendees wrote individual petitions to Governor Jerry Brown and the UC Board of Regents voicing their frustration on tuition increases.</p>\n<p>EVPSA Office Fellow and first-year Asian American studies and political science double major Akshaya Natarajan said the event aimed to “rally voices” and communicate that the suggested tuition freezes are not a sufficient solution to the increasing cost of tuition.</p>\n<p>​”The message for this event says that we are still fucked because there are a lot of problems, such as the eight percent increase of out of state tuition and increases for graduate school tuition as well,” Natarajan said. “Tuition freeze is not enough because it will fuck us over in the future if it is not taken care of.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and art double major Joseline Garcia said We’re fUCked informs students of how tuition hikes affect them.</p>\n<p>“This will get students angry because you need an education no matter where you go,” Garcia said. “Your skin color, background, lifestyle, culture, ideals and majors do not matter because this tuition hike will definitely affect you in some way.”</p>\n<p>​Natarajan said tuition hikes should receive more “pressing exposure” from the media.</p>\n<p>“This is why we invited plenty of news sources to report on this specific event today,” Natarajan said. “As long as we have more momentum and more media, then I deeply believe this will influence more change for the betterment of all students. It is not enough to simply oppose the tuition hikes.”</p>\n<p>​Natarajan said students should be angered by the tuition hikes and continue protesting in order to affect change.</p>\n<p>“Defunding of the UC is something that anyone should be angered about because, realistically, we are paying more and more for our public education, even though the state should be funding us,” Natarajan said. “We have angered students all across the state.”</p>\n<p>​Tuition increases contribute to financial challenges for students now and will continue to do so in their futures, according to EVPSA and fourth-year political science and film &amp; media studies double major Melvin Singh.</p>\n<p>“I am starting to believe that school is only preparing me to deal with a bad economy which is full of debts such as the tuition hikes which are fucking us all,” Singh said. “This is why we are still fucked and angry.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza said temporary tuition freezes are comparable to open wounds.</p>\n<p>“If you take a knife and stick it six inches deep into a man’s body and pull it out, it is not progress,” Mirza said. “Progress is healing that wound completely. The same thing is happening now because the UC system is pulling the knife out instead of healing the students’ wounds.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said Brown and Napolitano do not consider students’ perspectives when raising tuition.</p>\n<p>“I think Governor Brown and President Napolitano think it is a good idea to raise tuition because they are not students,” Mirza said. “This is not their university. This is our university.”</p>\n<p>A.S. off-campus senator and second-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said unaffordable tuition restricts her housing situation.</p>\n<p>“I live in a one bedroom apartment in Isla Vista,” Dela Cruz said. “I have five roommates who live with me, not because they want to, but because the tuition costs leave them with no other viable option.”</p>\n<p>Community affairs student engagement and advocacy advisor and graduate student Aaron Jones said the UC system is “undermining” the students’ efforts.</p>\n<p>“I am utterly displeased with conversations about the tuition hikes,” Jones said. “I am utterly displeased because there are thousands of students who are trying their damn best to be the best students they can be.”</p>\n<p>Jones said while graduate students work long hours, they still face student debt following graduating.</p>\n<p>“As graduate students and TA’s, we put in hours of hard work by grading hundreds of papers and studying for our own classes,” Jones said. “In turn, we receive debt as a reward which only causes sorrow and leads people to have less confidence in the education system.”</p>\n<p>According to Garcia, tuition hikes have a greater impact on students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“I think it is ridiculous to raise tuition because this will only cause people to be less educated in society,” Garcia said. “It puts people of color at risk of not receiving an education and makes society unreliable as a whole. We need more educated people to make life more efficient.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63510\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63510\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/","id":2755,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2754,2753,2752],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Groups Dedicate Memorial Garden","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-3-e1431986874217.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-3-e1431986874217.jpg?resize=600%2C401&ssl=1","description":"On Saturday, the Isla Vista Recreation & Park District and Project I.V.

Love held the I.V. Love and Remembrance Garden dedication ceremony for the six victims of the events of May 23 last year at a ceremony in the newly planted garden at People’s Park.</p>\n<p>UCSB administrators, students and Associated Students, county officials and representatives from participating organizations, such as Woodstock’s Pizza, Santa Barbara Forge + Iron and Seaborn Designs spoke at the event, officially opening the newly renovated park. The previous weekend, volunteers planted saplings and constructed a walking path through People’s Park around six benches with unique patterns representing the interests of each victim of the May 23 tragedy. Project I.V. Love founder and UCSB alumnus Jordan Killebrew, fourth-year art major Caila Baltas and fourth-year art major Jonathan Holcomb designed the benches and were present at the dedication.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said the garden is a “healing” place for the community to reflect on their memories of the victims.</p>\n<p>“This is a place where I think all of us can … sit here and connect with those precious lives, our friends, our fellow students who left us way too soon in their lives,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Killebrew said while the idea for the garden initially stemmed from his feelings of hopelessness following the tragedy, he appreciates the ability to honor the victims through the project.</p>\n<p>“It was way too close to home for me,” Killebrew said. “A year ago I would never have imagined this would happen and I’m just so happy that I have the opportunity to do something for the victims that we lost.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the circular design of the benches represents unity and “togetherness.”</p>\n<p>“The curves on the benches, if we were to put them in a circle, they form a perfect circle and the unity of those six students and imagining that for me is very, very comforting and very healing,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Sam Spinner said he believes the memorial garden will have a lasting, positive impact on the community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great,” Spinner said. “I think we really needed something memorable for the next students to come here and realize how big of an impact this event made on us. It’s beautiful and all the benches are amazing.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year theater and film &amp; media studies double major Kirsten Nygaard said the garden is an important step towards the regrowth of I.V. after the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really wonderful that they were able to create something for the community to heal and to grow and to remember life and love,” Nygaard said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said I.V. is stronger and more united than she has ever seen it in her time as supervisor.</p>\n<p>“I am always proud to represent Isla Vista,” Farr said. “But in the seven years I have represented this community I have never been prouder of Isla Vista than I am at this moment.”</p><div

senior to Facebook and Buzzfeed celebrity as a result of the enormous following his senior flute recital has gathered.</p>\n<p>His Facebook event page, “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/874090079303714/\" target=\"_blank\">Azeem’s Senior Flute Recital</a>,” has over 41,000 people listed as “going,” and that number is continually on the rise. Following this incredible and almost instantaneous explosion in popularity, an article posted by Buzzfeed helped to rocket Azeem to the forefront of, strangely enough, British media.</p>\n<p>Azeem said this whole ordeal started when he made his Facebook event public instead of private.</p>\n<p>“I guess when you make public events, they go viral now or something. If you read the description it just says ‘please come out and support,’” Azeem said. “I invited like 600 friends, but in the beginning, it was just like 70 people going, and at the end of the day, it was 120 people going and this guy from England, the UK — Damon Poole — was one of the first people to repost and then repost again.”</p>\n<p>Azeem said he doesn’t know Poole and has not been able to reach him either. According to Azeem, the event page “took off” following Poole’s repost.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know him and, at that point, random people started commenting ‘Yea Azeem!’ ‘You’re gonna kill it!’ ‘It’s gonna go off,’” Azeem said. “And then I started seeing the memes, you know, like me on the moon with girls and stuff.”</p>\n<p>All this popularity, though, came from out of the blue, Azeem said.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t do anything,” Azeem said. “One night it was 150 [people attending the event], last night 12k and now it’s like 40k … Just out of nowhere.”</p>\n<p>Azeem said, despite the newfound internet fame that he has found, the recital is really about the music for him.</p>\n<p>“I’m just here trying to do my thing, you know, play the flute,” Azeem said. “It’s a standard flute recital, you know? I’m not gonna do anything crazy.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63464\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63464\" data-attachment-id=\"63464\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-15/azeem-ward-overnight-flute-sensation/azeem_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431606146\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Azeem_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63464\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63464\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With all the buzz following him, Azeem said he has gotten offers from papers and radio stations all over the UK to talk about the experience, and even received an offer to perform another recital at Bristol, which he said he is dubious about accepting.</p>\n<p>“People from the UK newspapers wanna interview me and stuff, and a guy at Bristol, the event manager there, wants me to come and do a recital,” Azeem said. “I wanna see how people react to it first, ’cause I’m not sure they understand what I’m about to do.”</p>\n<p>As a result of this unpredicted popularity, Azeem said he is concerned that his friends and family won’t even find seats at the recital.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna have to reserve the front row for my friends, family and roommates, ’cause I gotta have those people there, you know? Those people mean a lot to me,” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year CCS music major Robert Johnson, who will be performing with Azeem at the recital, said people are traveling from across the globe to see Azeem’s recital.</p>\n<p>“Someone is actually flying in from Britain,” Johnson said. “My friend is picking him up at the airport in the morning.”</p>\n<p>Johnson also said he is trying to change the location of the concert to a bigger venue to accommodate more people.</p>\n<p>Despite his Facebook popularity, Azeem said he is uncertain as to what his future in the music business will bring.</p>\n<p>“They haven’t even really heard me yet, you know what I mean? If people are still interested in me going over to the UK and actually want me to go and do the recital for whatever reason, then I’ll do that — I’d be down,” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>Azeem said he is currently working on composing music for film in addition to preparing for the suddenly-big recital this Sunday.</p>\n<p>“I’m working on a composition for a silent film by Alex Payne that’s gonna premier at the Reel Loud Film Festival next week,” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>According to Azeem, even though he appreciates the newfound fame, he doesn’t quite understand it.</p>\n<p>“My page is getting more likes than the guy who won the biggest flute competition in the world, and people are like, ‘Why?’” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>Azeem’s recital is set to be held tomorrow, May 16, at 3:00 p.m. in Karl Geiringer Hall.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

and question and answer session in the MultiCultural Center on Thursday as part of the week-long “We’re fUCked” campaign to protest the proposed UC system tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, UC President Janet Napolitano announced that Governor Jerry Brown and the UC agreed on a revised state budget proposal titled “May Revise,” which will freeze UC tuition for the next two years. Graduate and undergraduate students, Office of Financial Aid representatives, professors, KCSB staff members and Associated Students (A.S.) attended the We’re fUCked discussion, addressing issues regarding tuition hikes and how the May Revise will affect students.</p>\n<p>Though tuition is now frozen for in-state students over the next two years, tuition for out-of-state residents will increase by eight percent per year, according to UCSB Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships Michael Miller.</p>\n<p>“Every student pays the mandatory UC tuition, which is $12,192,” Miller said. “Non-residents supplemental tuition is an additional $24,000 on top of that. Eight percent is definitely not good news for out-of-state students, and we can’t give out-of-state students any more financial aid than we do our California students.”</p>\n<p>According Miller, UCSB has the highest campus-based fees of all the UC campuses with a total cost of $25,836 for a student living on campus, $12,192 of which is for tuition.</p>\n<p>“Our campus-based fees are $1,673 — that is certainly concerning,” Miller said. “One of the other fees that’s really concerning is the Gaucho Health Insurance, which is over $2,700. Just a few years ago, it was $1,375, so that’s been a massive, massive increase.”</p>\n<p>Miller said while about 70 percent of UCSB students receive some form of financial aid, UCSB should allocate more money for scholarships.</p>\n<p>“One area we really need a lot of work on is scholarships,” Miller said. “We only administer about $13.2 million worth of scholarships and, of that, $4.1 come from outside agencies.”</p>\n<p>Gevirtz School graduate student of education and co-host of KCSB’s “Radio Occupy” Kathy Swift said the 2008 market crash created a “tuition crisis” of trillions of dollars in student debt, the highest of any single consumer debt within the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Basically, we have a situation in which we have austerity across the United States, and it’s finally starting to trickle down to the university system,” Swift said. “Student debt and student loans have become the most pressing area of consumer debt in the United States. It surpassed every other area of consumer debt.”</p>\n<p>Swift said the debt students are accumulating while obtaining higher education is negatively affecting their daily lifestyles, which goes against the “American Dream.”</p>\n<p>“Students are so desperate that we have to provide food banks for them, and some students are living out of their cars and in less-than-good housing situations,” Swift said. “This is madness.”</p>\n<p>According to Swift, the tuition crisis the millennial generation is facing stifles upward mobility because many cannot afford to pursue a higher education.</p>\n<p>“The mission statement of California says we should all be guaranteed higher education,” Swift said. “That’s not really the case anymore. That social contract is gone now.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63457\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63457\" data-attachment-id=\"63457\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/mcc-may-14th-2015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431618847\",\"copyright\":\"Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"110\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63457\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Chair and professor of black studies Jeffrey Stewart said the education policy has been changed to outsourcing universities while increasing funding for prisons.</p>\n<p>“The idea of neoliberalism has taken over to where everyone is now looked at as a private corporation,” Stewart said. “The larger dynamic is taxpayers in the state of California no longer think your education is worth their tax dollars. They feel more comfortable paying for prisons to lock up people.”</p>\n<p>Stewart also said the decision to stagnate tuition for two years is only a temporary solution to satisfy student concerns, and problems will still be present at the end of the freeze.</p>\n<p>“Freezing the tuition for two years only allows for the activists to graduate,” Stewart said. “It also leads you to believe that the current situation is acceptable, but it’s not. Where can we begin to organize to put political pressure on those who make those decisions?”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jared Daniels said the UC creating a three-party system, under which funding methods are different for UC campuses, California State campuses and City College campuses, created a hierarchal system rather than facilitating collaboration between students.</p>\n<p>“Before this tri-party system, universities were a free-for-all, competing against one another for the funds the state could give them,” Daniels said. “So in 1960, the UC President and state government came together and passed what was known as the ‘master plan’ which established the three-party system based on accessibility and quality.”</p>\n<p>According to Daniels, the master plan did not provide long-term sustainable resources for revenue, and President Regan’s economic policies required students to pay for education as opposed to the government providing public education.</p>\n<p>“We were just always hoping that California taxpayers would be willing to pay higher taxes for the system and we always figured the politicians would find the money,” Daniels said. “But obviously that’s not quite the case.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA policy analyst and fourth-year political science major Brett Carpenter said the UC is admitting a greater percentage of students from out-of-state to increase funding.</p>\n<p>“We’re admitting more and more of them into our schools each year,” Carpenter said. “That’s because we get a lot of money from them and the out-of-state tuition goes straight to the campus. There is a very identifiable incentive to take more of those people.”</p>\n<p>According to Carpenter, privatization of universities devalues a Bachelor’s degree, making it difficult to get a job after graduation, which incentivizes students to pursue post-undergraduate education.</p>\n<p>“The UC really has no interest in getting you a job after graduation,” Carpenter said. “Why? Because you can come back and pay them for a Master’s degree. They want to provide us with the lowest cost education they can while extracting from us the most money.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63467\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63467\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/","id":2748,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2747,2746,2745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vigil Honors Lives Lost to Suicide","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) hosted a candlelight vigil in Storke Plaza Wednesday evening to provide a space for students, staff and residents of Isla Vista to honor lives los...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_63406\" style=\"width: 313px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63406\" data-attachment-id=\"63406\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/vigil-honors-lives-lost-to-suicide/vigil_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=401%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"401,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431509778\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0666666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Vigil_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=401%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-63406\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=303%2C453\" alt=\"C.A.P.S. members lit up Storke Plaza with paper bag lanterns in memory of suicide victims.

The vigil provided a space to “leave feelings behind.” <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) hosted a candlelight vigil in Storke Plaza Wednesday evening to provide a space for students, staff and residents of Isla Vista to honor lives lost to suicide.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. members placed over fifty white paper bags containing tea lights along the steps leading into Storke Plaza for the vigil, upon which volunteers and attendees wrote words of remembrance. Students and I.V. community members paid their respects at the event and released floating lanterns into the Storke Plaza pond.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. psychology intern Shannon Hackett said she was inspired to host the event by students at UC Irvine who held a similar candlelight vigil to honor victims of suicide. According to Hackett, students need spaces to discuss their losses and to share tragedy preventative measures.</p>\n<p>“I think that this is something that really just meets a need at UCSB,” Hackett said. “We lose students pretty much every year either to accidental death or to suicide and it’s a way to just give people a space to honor people.”</p>\n<p>Hackett also said she hopes the vigil was a place for survivors to “leave feelings behind” and participate in healing interactions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the times we’re talking more about prevention or intervention and there’s not a lot of time to talk about those that we have lost,” Hackett said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and C.A.P.S. student health peer Melina Mossberg said the candlelight vigil was meant to welcome a variety of students, not just those who have lost someone to suicide. Mossberg also said she hopes to continue hosting events that will adapt to meet the needs of the UCSB community in the future.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time and we’re trying it out and, hopefully, this will be something that we’ll continue doing in the future,” Mossberg said. “People will always have this space and they’ll have an opportunity to come and even just be allies if they haven’t lost somebody.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it’s important for survivors, for the people who are here, to be able to honor the person that they’ve lost and also to just raise awareness about suicide, just so they know people care. – C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford</p></blockquote>\n<p>C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford said C.A.P.S. hopes to host similar events during Suicide Prevention Month in the fall to continue providing an outlet for people to support each other and share their experiences.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for survivors, for the people who are here, to be able to honor the person that they’ve lost and also to just raise awareness about suicide, just so they know people care,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and psychology double major Nelson Moreno said the vigil was another step towards the removal of the stigma surrounding mental health issues, and served to bring students together, especially given the May 11 Sabado Tarde incident.</p>\n<p>“It’s been done in other UCs and I think having it here in Santa Barbara will promote an understanding and compassion toward people that have completed suicide,” Moreno said. “I think this month can be very triggering to students especially with the tragedy.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Janice Ong said students need opportunities to discuss sensitive issues such as suicide at events like the candlelight vigil.</p>\n<p>“It helps students understand and gives them a safe space to talk,” Ong said. “I feel like suicide is not talked about a lot; it’s really sensitive and … this gives a safe and healing space for students who have maybe experienced any of that in their life.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It also includes $436 million over the next three years to reduce UC’s pension liability. A tuition freeze would be contingent on the UC Board of Regents lowing its pension ceiling and establishing benefit plans for certain employees in accordance with the 2013 Public Employees Pension Reform Act.</p>\n<p>UC plans to further increase revenue by raising the Student Service Fee by five percent annually and, if approved at the May 21 meeting of the UC Board of Regents, increase out-of-state tuition by eight percent annually. The budget will go to the state legislature for consideration.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said Brown has acknowledged the importance of UC education by agreeing to the budget revisions.</p>\n<p>“With this agreement, the Governor has recognized the need to reinvest in UC as well as the imperative to provide students, their families and the University with a reliable way to budget for the cost of a UC education,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Communications Director for the A.S. Lobby Corps and first-year art history major Lacy Wright said she supports the proposed increase to the Student Services Fee, because UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is in need of better funding.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. works so incredibly hard to help all the students seeking counseling, but just doesn’t have the funds,” Wright said. “Students often have to wait weeks to see a counselor, and this wait could be drastically shortened with the increase in funds.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major Mohsin Mirza said while Student Service Fee provides important services, students should not have to bear so much of the financial burden.</p>\n<p>“The services fee will go to programs that are very helpful and necessary, like increased funding for mental health services so C.A.P.S. can hire more practitioners,” Mirza said. “It’s incredibly important, but unfortunate that, once again, it’ll be students who, across the state, already are struggling financially, who will have to be picking up the tab rather than the state.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63462\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63462\" data-attachment-id=\"63462\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/budgetproposal-to-freeze-in-state-tuition-provide-more-program-funds/brown_budget-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416399737\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brown_Budget-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63462\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Daily Nexus File Photo\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Mirza said the proposed increase to out-of-state tuition is “unfortunate” because it will exclude many people of lower economic classes from attending a UC.</p>\n<p>“Out-of-state students are already extremely financially burdened, and I worry that this latest increase will mean that only the wealthiest out-of-state students will continue to afford to be here.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, Prop 13 reform and UC budget transparency can help eliminate future “tuition battles.”</p>\n<p>“These are the big changes we need, and the only way I can foresee that happening is if we can build a stronger student movement over the next two years,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said the budget revision will not accommodate UC’s desired increase in enrollment.</p>\n<p>“It does not fund California student enrollment growth — so our work is not done,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to a statement from the UC Students Association (UCSA), UCSA President Jefferson Kuoch-Seng said while May Revise is an important step, students should continue pushing for lower tuition.</p>\n<p>“Today’s announcement contains promising news for California UC undergraduates,” Kuoch-Seng said. “However, students will continue our direct advocacy in Sacramento and build broad support across California within and beyond our campuses.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he is “cautiously optimistic” UC will use new state funding efficiently.</p>\n<p>“The UC has a history of mismanaging funds, it was a key reason as to why Prop 30 failed to have the impact we had hoped it would,” Mirza said. “I know students will be doing their best to hold them accountable.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Melgoza, Weyrick and Vasquez will meet with Yang again on Monday to present a budget and discuss details and execution of the agreements.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Melgoza said Yang and administrators met the demands with only a few changes to the wording.</p>\n<p>“All the demands are going to be in print … and the whole school’s going to see them,” Melgoza said. “We made a few adjustments, but just on the wording and on the jargon of everything. They were pretty concrete demands, and they met them.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she looks forward to attending UCSB as an ordinary student knowing there will now be policies to sanction sexual assault offenders and provide support to victims.</p>\n<p>“It’s been such a part of my life throughout my college experience that I don’t remember what it’s like to be a normal college student,” Melgoza said. “I’m excited to see what that will look like, where I will be fighting for other students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s been such a part of my life throughout my college experience that I don’t remember what it’s like to be a normal college student. I’m excited to see what that will look like.           – Alejandra Melgoza</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gaucho Consent Co-Chair and second-year sociology major Weyrick said the group will continue to organize and push their demands to the UC level to ensure system-wide sanctions for perpetrators of sexual misconduct.</p>\n<p>“This is clearly the beginning — not the end — for us,” Weyrick said. “We have a meeting on Monday set up and the Regents-wide meeting will be big for some of these [demands] that we can implement on a UC-wide basis outside of just UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Weyrick said the group communicated with various organizations to accomplish their goals, initiating conversations about gender representative safety programs with Isla Vista Foot Patrol and establishing a survivor fund for sexual assault victims.</p>\n<p>According to Weyrick, one of the most important accomplishments of the sit-in was a mandate ensuring the removal of students from residence halls if they are found guilty of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest victory was understanding the power of student activism, there’s so much here that we accomplished.” Weyrick said. “If we were just three students sitting in an office … they wouldn’t have [been] taken as seriously, so I feel like the credit needs to go to the bodies that came here and chose to work with us and help us.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Melissa Vasquez said the administrators met the initial demands the group had when they began the sit-in.</p>\n<p>“We came here with something in mind and administration wasn’t trying to hear us out and stuff,” Vasquez said. “We were able to put our foot down and be able to get our demands met, and we had something in mind when we got here and we left with it, too, so it’s kind of really exciting.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63397\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1154692763\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63423\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63397\" data-attachment-id=\"63397\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/students-demand-change/rape-protest/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Rape Protest\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431518175\",\"copyright\":\"John Clow\\/DN\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"Rape Protest\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Rape Protest\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63397 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"John Clow/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Yang said he was grateful students and administrators were ultimately able to work together.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate the opportunity to hear the survivors speak and also that students have come up with proposals for solutions,” Yang said. “We will continue to refine these solutions.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students President and fourth-year sociology major Ali Guthy said in addition to the approved demands, the university should develop a sexual assault policy specific to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“UCSB doesn’t have our own sexual assault policies.

External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), he will ensure the office continues to work on long-term sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>“Next year, we will be working on making sure that these demands and more changes to make these policies much better will be put in place,” Mirza said. “But many of the changes should be coming very quickly.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[Correction: This article

<em>Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>­­­</p>\n<p>Residence halls Multicultural Awareness Chairs held a discussion Wednesday titled “Where Are We Now?” to explore students’ healing processes following the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>The Multicultural Awareness Chairs chose the theme “You Can Sit with Us” to foster inclusive discussion. Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) Training Director Juan Riker led a discussion in which students shared feelings on the upcoming May 23 anniversary and the May 11 Sabado Tarde Road incident. Students signed chalkboards as a symbol of solidarity.</p>\n<p>San Rafael Hall Multicultural Awareness Chair and second-year sociology major Curnishia Woodbury said freshman students are often alienated from the rest of the UCSB community because they did not experience the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“There is this empathy gap between us and the freshmen who are new here,” Woodbury said.</p>\n<p>According to Woodbury, open discussions are important because they expose how past events continue to affect people’s lives.</p>\n<p>“Problems are still here,” Woodbury said. “Spring Quarter last year, it was like everybody said ‘how are you?’ but Fall Quarter rolls around and everybody is back to like ‘Hey, I.V., let’s go party.’ They are still perpetuating the same problems that existed before.”</p>\n<p>Woodbury said the group also addressed why society tends to shame men who express their feelings, discussing what it means to be masculine and how society is “perpetuating” a male-dominated society.</p>\n<p>“I hoped that people would keep the dialogue going, keep talking about what masculinity means — what does femininity mean?” Woodbury said. “What are we doing here in this I.V. community? Why do we still perpetuate these same norms when we could change it after what happened?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Women tend to be diagnosed with depression, whereas men tend to externalize versus internalize their feelings. – C.A.P.S. Training Director Juan Riker</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Riker, attendees discussed how women share emotions more frequently and are more likely to be diagnosed with depression.</p>\n<p>“Women tend to be diagnosed with depression, whereas men tend to externalize versus internalize their feelings,” Riker said.</p>\n<p>Riker said C.A.P.S. encourages students to seek out counseling services during the week of May 23.</p>\n<p>“It is important to stress support and not being alone,” Woodbury said.</p>\n<p>Riker said his repressed emotions from the events of May 23 last year may have been triggered by the May 11 Sabado Tarde Road incident.</p>\n<p>“Clearly, that shook all of us — just wrapping our minds around that happening again,” Riker said.</p>\n<p>Second-year black studies and sociology double major Chika Anyiw said the chalkboards students signed will be displayed at San Rafael and Manzanita Residence Halls.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the chalkboards is to distribute them, have one be in San Rafael somewhere and the other one be in Manzanita by the central front desk it and if not give it to OSL [Office of Student Life] and then OSL would choose to place it somewhere on campus,” Anyiw said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clinic building are currently underway, and new tenants providing mental health reseources for I.V. residents are set to move in in July. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors approved a renovation budget of approximately $335,000 for the Isla Vista Clinic building on Tuesday to refurbish and lease currently vacant office spaces.</p>\n<p>The planned renovations will allow for additional tenants to lease office spaces in the building, one-third of which is currently used by I.V. Clinic. Of the nine organizations who applied for a lease, Santa Barbara County general services staff chose the Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, Regents of the University of California and Isla Vista Youth Projects Inc. for the clinic. All three are slated to sign five-year leases and to agree to a three percent annual rent increase.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Assistant Director for General Services Greg Chanis said the county assumed ownership of the building last summer and chose these three specific nonprofit organizations to best serve community needs.</p>\n<p>­“There was a lot of community support for the county to retain ownership of the building,” Chanis said. “Based on that, the county is really working on having the building be a community asset.”</p>\n<p>According to the Board of Supervisors’ proposal for the clinic renovations, the Regents will lease space to set up offices for a variety of campus mental health services available to students and I.V. residents. Resources will include Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.), Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and Student Mental Health Coordination Services (SMHCS).</p>\n<p>Third-year literature and sociology major and former C.A.R.E. student staff member Emily Potter said expanding C.A.R.E.’s services in I.V. will be beneficial to non-students seeking support.</p>\n<p>“I think it will be excellent for the community to have a space like CARE in Isla Vista,” Potter said in an email. “CARE’s services are not just limited to UCSB students so I’m really excited at the possibility that the additional location will let students from SBCC and other community members with a need for advocacy resources to feel they have better access to them.”</p>\n<p>Potter said the community will benefit greatly from the renovation of these spaces, as this means there will be room for the expansion of mental health services in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It will allow services like CARE to expand because of the additional space and I think there is a great need for that, so the opportunity for the growth of the program is great too,” Potter said in email.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Youth Projects Inc. Fiscal Manager and Board Member Arthur Kennedy said the leased office space will be used for the organization’s administrative needs, though they are also considering incorporating other services such as a weekly family resource center.</p>\n<p>“We need the space, because we only have about four office workers in our Goleta office,” Kennedy said. “But we are considering having a weekly family resource center availability within these offices as well as other services.”</p>\n<p>According to Chanis, renovations are underway and tenants are expected to move into the office spaces in July.</p>\n<p>“We’re finishing up the exterior stairwell, and are nearly completed with the roof,” Chanis said. “So the interior and exterior are undergoing renovations that should open up the space for the tenants.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said while the I.V. Clinic renovations will provide necessary services, she plans to develop a community center in the building adjacent to the clinic that formerly housed the Saint Athanasius church.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the space that we want as a community center — we are still looking for the moment to do that at the rehabilitation of a former church building,” Farr said. “The tenants should be meeting this summer at the new fiscal year and then I’m turning my attention to rehabilitating the church to turn into a community center.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of teh Thursday May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The highly selective SHCD certificate allows the city access to state funds for planned affordable housing developments, according to Greene.</p>\n<p>Greene said Goleta received $3.6 million in “active transportation grants,” that will fund bicycle path and walkway improvements.</p>\n<p>According to Greene, retail and industrial vacancies are both low at less than three percent vacancy, and hotel occupancy increased 13.8 percent over the last year.</p>\n<p>Greene also said an increase in revenue from taxes such as the Transient Occupancy Tax and Sales Tax indicate Goleta’s financial future is bright.</p>\n<p>“Goleta is an excellent place to start and run a business,” Greene said. “Goleta’s overall position is solid and our future is promising.”</p>\n<p>Miller also said there are plans to revamp Goleta’s Old Town and capitalize on the uniquely authentic quality that it offers Goleta residents.</p>\n<p>“We have so many great neighborhoods in Goleta that are already flourishing,” Miller said. “But there’s something that feels like our soul and our purpose when we visit Old Town.”</p>\n<p>President and CEO of Montecito Bank and Trust Janet Garufis said the Goleta business community has played a crucial role in the immense progress the city has made over the past years.</p>\n<p>“The businesses in Goleta are so connected to each other, it is just extraordinary,” Garufis said. “There are so many great things happening in this community and that could not happen without the support of local businesses.”</p>\n<p>According to Bacara Resort &amp; Spa General Manager Kathleen Cochran, supporting local business in Goleta is crucial to the development of the city.</p>\n<p>“I live here, I do all of my business here,” Cochran said. “Community partnership and hospitality go hand in hand.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus \" width=\"500\" height=\"750\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63408\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Das Williams.<em> Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The California State Assembly Committee on Local Government voted 6-1 with two abstentions on Wednesday to re-refer Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) to the Joint Committee on Fairs, Allocation and Classification.</p>\n<p>The bill establishes Isla Vista self-governance through a Community Services District (CSD) funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), if approved by voters within the district’s proposed boundaries. Williams wrote AB 3 as an alternative to establishing a CSD through the Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) in order to address the need for improved infrastructure and services in the I.V. community. Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud organized a group of UCSB students and I.V. residents to speak in favor of the bill during public comment.</p>\n<p>Assemblymember Williams said the bill is going straight to the committee because previous attempts to establish I.V. self-governance over the last 45 years have been stifled by LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“When a local LAFCO cannot take care of a very important, complicated but ever-present problem for 45 years, do we have the authority to take that back and act ourselves?” Williams said. “I think we do.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill has been thoroughly evaluated by the community since first being introduced to the Assembly in December.</p>\n<p>“While the CSD is not going through the traditional LAFCO process, this bill has undergone extensive community outreach, including 42 public meetings and four public town halls,” Williams said. “It truly reflects the majority opinion from the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the current conditions in I.V. are at a “breaking point” and require improved services such as additional police, a parking district and a tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>“Critical infrastructure and services are not being provided and the safety and wellbeing of I.V.’s residents are not being adequately protected,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year political science and psychology double major Cameron Schunk said AB 3 is an opportunity to redefine I.V. through the establishment of CSD.</p>\n<p>“We have consistently had a lack of opportunity to prove ourselves,” Schunk said. “We are consistently at the behest of media sources and every time something happens in Isla Vista, we are painted colors that we have no choice or say in.”</p>\n<p>Chair of the Local Governance Committee Assemblymember and UCSB alumnus Brian Maienschein said, while he chose to abstain from voting on the motion because of his connection to USCB, he plans to continue working with Williams on AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is unique,” Maienschein said. “I have been persuaded by the testimony today and just kind of my life experience there, so I won’t quite get to ‘yes,’ but I want to keep working with you and your office on this.”</p>\n<p>Maienschein said that AB 3 resonates with him on a personal level because of his experience living in Isla Vista for three years.</p>\n<p>“I think Isla Vista sits in a unique position,” Maienschein said, “because of all the issues that have traditionally been there back since my time up through the current time. In fact, the latest incident was in literally one of the exact blocks I lived on. So this hits close to home for me.”</p>\n<p>Thirty-three year I.V. resident and homeowner Pegeen Souter said she opposes the bill and favors the LAFCO process because she feels AB 3 does not clarify funding and the role of UC Santa Barbara in a CSD.</p>\n<p>“It takes time and information to craft a solid and lasting form of government,” Souter said. “If this bill is to move forward, then it should go through the LAFCO process.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara LAFCO Executive Officer Paul L. Hood said the commission is taking an “oppose unless amended position” on AB 3, and the commission should be included in the formation process to ensure a financially feasible CSD.</p>\n<p>“We strongly believe the Santa Barbara LAFCO should be involved in the formation process,” Hood said. “We also believe that the LAFCO process would afford a feasibility study to be prepared, which would determine the viability, the sustainability of revenues that would be available to the new CSD.”</p>\n<p>California Association of Local Agency Formation Commissions (CALAFCO) Executive Director Pamela Miller said the commission does not oppose the CSD itself, but believes LAFCO should be included in its establishment.</p>\n<p>“CALAFCO is not arguing whether or not a CSD is the appropriate mechanism, our concerns lie in the bypassing of the LAFCO process,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Miller said, while there are certain components in AB 3 that LAFCO cannot grant, excluding the commission may lead to greater risks.</p>\n<p>“It is true, as the assemblyman said that LAFCO cannot approve the proposed governance structure or the proposed services to be provided,” Miller said. “But bypassing the comprehensive analysis is very dangerous … all of our concerns would be addressed if a comprehensive review by the LAFCO were done.”</p>\n<p>Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs board member and second-year communications and film and media studies double major Arielle Kronovet said one the biggest issues facing I.V. is inadequate parking.</p>\n<p>“I’m lucky I have parkway so I don’t have to deal with parking,” Kronovet said. “But last year I was searching sometimes for hours trying to find parking, and I couldn’t afford parking on campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Kronovet, students need the government to protect students from property management companies that abuse their power and take advantage of students.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the year, my house was robbed,” Kronovet said. “There was no evidence of forced entry so the property management wouldn’t change the locks and they had a key. I called the property management, and they told me it wasn’t a high priority issue.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said a CSD in I.V. will require components LAFCO cannot establish, such as a UUT and a hybrid board with elected and hybrid board with elected and appointed members representing entities such as UCSB, SBCC and Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“What I wanted to convey to the legislature was the uniqueness of Isla Vista, and the fact that we had demanded a unique solution, requiring some elements that [neither] LAFCO nor the board of supervisors could grant,” Farr said. “Only the legislature could.”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO members should offer alternative ways to help I.V. rather than criticize AB 3.</p>\n<p>“I can understand [LAFCO] having concerns, but they did not express more concern and care for the future of the community,” Farr said. “You can have questions and you can have concerns, but also, show us that you really do want to be helpful. I have to say I haven’t gotten that sense at the meetings.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, Isla Vista does not have a high source of income from sales or property taxes.</p>\n<p>“[I.V.] doesn’t have a lot of commercial development or other kinds of sales tax or transient occupancy tax generators, hotels and such and the community,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>“Properties in the community don’t change hands very often, so the property tax that has been being paid is probably much lower than if the property was sold and then reassessed.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator-elect and second-year political science major Louis Mariano said he appreciates Farr’s supporting AB 3 regardless of her position in the county.</p>\n<p>“She’s always been there for Isla Vista and been working hard for the county to focus on it,” Mariano said. “She’s in a tight squeeze, but I am very grateful she was for the bill, because she knows Isla Vista needs help.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said Maienschein’s support of AB 3 shows the importance of I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“It shows Isla Vista has faced the same issues over and over without a way to correct them permanently,” Abboud said. “The root of the issue has been no local control and no local self-determination. I think him being moved by his own personal experiences is indicative of why we need to pass this bill.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, students have shown they can efficiently hold leadership positions regardless of how long they live and stay in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Students are regularly elected and do a wonderful job,” Abboud said. “Just because students with a little ‘S’ are transient, students with a big ‘S’ aren’t.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article was titled “Contested Bill Addresses Isla Vista Self-Governance”.

Senate met Wednesday night in the UCen’s Flying “A” Room for their weekly senate meeting.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate discussed budget reallocations, A.S. Commission on Student Well-Being (COSWB) funding, Monday’s domestic disturbance and the search for a new Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>A.S. Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said due to lack of time left this quarter, he would like to override the legal code and pass a bill that would allow the transfer of $10,000 earmarked for “Professional Development” from the A.S. budget to senate unallocated funds.</p>\n<p>“The process is usually [as follows:] I would have to present the idea two weeks out from the time it needs to be done, and that would have to be ratified by Business and Finance by 50 percent plus one,” Theus said. “Because it’s Week Seven that’s not really going to work so I will need you all to essentially override the legal code and approve that.”</p>\n<p>Theus said Professional Development money went untouched by A.S. this year because it was not needed and could be put to better use by the senate to fund events and groups.</p>\n<p>“I think if there was a need for it, it would have been used, but I don’t think there is a need for it in Associated Students,” Theus said. “I know groups that it could help out a lot internally at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate passed the bill authorizing the transfer of the funds that Senate allocated.</p>\n<p>A.S. President said she was pleased with the student government’s prompt communication with the student body following the May 11 Sabado Tarde incident in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We had a remarkably fast and thorough response because your executive officers were actually meeting at the time of the incident, so we were able to pull together a very quick response,” Guthy said. “I’m very proud of how we handled it. I actually got a lot of administrators and community members thanking students for their involvement, not just executive officers.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said the search committee for a new Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs is currently deliberating over two final candidates.</p>\n<p>“We have two finalist candidates for the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs position,” Guthy said. “As you all know, this is a very important position because, obviously, they interact the most with students and deal with student life and a lot of the issues that are pertinent to us.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs candidate Monroe Gordon will meet with student representatives on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“One of the candidates will be on campus tomorrow and he will be having a conversation with students starting at 2:30 in the Mosher Alumni House,” Guthy said. “I think a select group of students were invited to that, but, to my knowledge, it’s not a closed meeting.”</p>\n<p>According to Theus, students are not well enough informed about the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs search committee.</p>\n<p>“Students were not consulted ahead of time in designing the interaction that the candidate will have with students,” Theus said. “The current student meeting is private and invite-only.”</p>\n<p>Theus said students should have the opportunity to interact with candidates because the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs is meant to represent students.</p>\n<p>“There should be an open space where students can meet this person or persons,” Theus said. “This is a very important position for students and we’re sidelined. At least the students on the search committee should be able to observe the candidate while they meet with deans and admin to see how they are as an ally behind closed doors.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Mental Health Coordinator Alex Hill said he is concerned regarding inappropriate spending by COSWB beginning in 2013.</p>\n<p>“Essentially there is a history of inappropriate spending with student fees,” Hill said. “I think there’s some serious misuse of funds. They may not be intentional, but it’s occurring, and you can see it started in 2013.”</p>\n<p>Hill said, despite a $2,500 allocation to advertising, the money is not being used efficiently and COSWB has not been responsive to his inquires about inefficient funding. According to a document Hill shared with the senate, COSWB paid $6,000 for T-shirts and $295 for a tablecloth in the past year.</p>\n<p>“They’re essentially spending vast amounts of money on advertising without any actual function,” Hill said. “They are not providing the services they should be in comparison to the funds they have.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate then moved on to debate the legitimacy of the Bill to Outline a Procedure for the Review of the Executive Branch Expenditures, and whether the bill overstepped certain powers.</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said she supports the bill because it requires the executive branch to follow the same rules as other A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t overstep [of authority] because we’re not actually approving or disapproving … we’re just having [expenditures] reviewed,” Mancini said. “They would have to submit their minutes to us and their expenditures before they spend the money, like any other A.S. agency.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh said the bill is problematic because excessive control of the executive office would result in inefficient financial delegations.</p>\n<p>“From what I understand, I still see it as an overstep. They would have to wait for a whole week for us to approve their spending,” Moreh said. “As we know, things move really fast within the association. If the executive officer needs to move those funds in the time frame of that week and he can’t do it within decent time, that causes problems.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate ultimately passed the Bill to Outline a Procedure for the Review of the Executive Branch Expenditures by a 17-2-0 vote.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/as-senate-talks-coswb-funds-monday-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/as-senate-talks-coswb-funds-monday-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/as-senate-talks-coswb-funds-monday-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/as-senate-talks-coswb-funds-monday-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/as-senate-talks-coswb-funds-monday-night/","id":2746,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2745,2744,2743],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"route":"/categories/news","page":117,"highestPage":277}},"__N_SSG":true}
