Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Pimentel’s platform is focused on the accountability of A.S. senators with an emphasis on ensuring that senators are active and effective liaisons to their BCUs.</p>\n<p>While Pimentel has experience in A.S., the resolutions he has authored have been mostly positional and not directional, which means they represent symbolic measures and not direct actions. Pimentel helped author a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and hate speech, along with a resolution condemning cyber-bullying.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus </em>acknowledges the importance of positional resolutions, Pimentel’s resolutions do not involve concrete action.</p>\n<p>Pimentel’s opponent, current On-Campus Senator Steven Ho, has accomplished more directional work during his time on Senate, such as authoring a resolution to demand the resignation of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity director and helping with the demands of undocumented students on campus through the organization Improving Dreams Equality Access And Success (I.D.E.A.S.).</p>\n<p>Ho explained the work he has done on Senate but lacked a tangible plan on how he would organize the Senate itself.</p>\n<p>Pimentel expressed plans to hold “one-on-ones” with senators to hear about their goals and plans and offer them help.</p>\n<p>He also wants to create a written contract that states the exact responsibilities of each senator and how much honoraria a senator will be docked if a responsibility is not completed as a way to hold officials accountable.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> is impressed with Pimentel’s plan to “revitalize public forums” during Senate meetings. Often, public forum can create a hostile environment for discussion of controversial topics, so a new approach might be beneficial.</p>\n<p>Pimentel hopes to expand the roles and duties of the campus visibility director to bridge the gap between A.S. and the student body.</p>\n<p>If Pimentel can successfully incorporate new accountability measures for senators and support more tangible and directional bills, we believe he will be an effective and diplomatic internal vice president.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily

class=\"wp-caption-text\">As previously <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/historic-el-centro-building-set-to-reopen/\">reported</a> in Jan. 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day eviction notice for the demolition of the building due to structural issues, including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.<em> Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Last Saturday — after nearly a year of fighting against the demolition of the building — students, community members and UCSB staff and faculty came together for the reopening of the renovated El Centro Arnulfo Casillas building.</p>\n<p>The open house celebration started with a ceremonial song and blessing by Chumash elder Marcus Lopez.</p>\n<p>“This center is to celebrate the new vision of the world that we are going to live in,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>He said the reopening shows that “tradition can break the master narrative” of historical colonial power over people of color and that the students, community and everyone involved in El Centro will redefine what the new narrative is.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy to see and to be here and to give you that message through these ancient songs,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>In commemorating the students for their work in saving El Centro, Lopez said “this is your strong hold, make it wise, make your connections with what you need to connect.”</p>\n<p>As previously <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/historic-el-centro-building-set-to-reopen/\">reported</a> in Jan. 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day eviction notice for the demolition of the building due to structural issues, including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>After the eviction notice, students and alumni voiced their frustration toward the administration and continually fought for the permanency and improvement of the building, according to Shahryar Mooraj, a member of the El Centro committee and fourth-year mathematical science and physics double major.</p>\n<p>“As students, we came together to stop that and to fight for the history and the culture that has been built in that space over time and to ensure that El Centro has a permanent physical space on campus,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>“Keeping the doors open for those yet to come,” is written on the sign hanging over the front door entrance.</p>\n<p>The reopening ceremony commemorated past and present students and faculty that have fought for the fruition and continuation of El Centro through decades of social justice work, community resistance and grassroots organizing so future students of color can feel they have a space at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I was one of the students who lead the negotiation for the rebuilding process in the El Centro committee,” UCSB alumna Damaris Adame said.</p>\n<p>Adame said the day they were served the eviction which “essentially condemned” and made “immediate evacuation” necessary on Jan. 9, 2017, feels like “decades ago [rather] than just last year.” But it was last year when we as students were told that the temporary building 406 was essentially condemned and our immediate evacuation was necessary,” Adame said.</p>\n<p>According to Adame, they were asked to “remove the art, the decades of posters, murals and designs” that mark student protests and struggles that were born and grew out of El Centro, but they were also asked to abandon “the safety [they] had created within these four walls.”</p>\n<p>Adame said that the students El Centro carry with them, the Chicanx movement of MEChA, the hunger strikes of 1988 and 1994, and more movements uplifted them.</p>\n<p>Congressman and UCSB alumnus Salud Carbajal and Chancellor Henry T. Yang were present at the ceremony along with Ozzie Vargas, director of the Educational Opportunity Program and representatives from Counseling and Psychological Services. Many Chicano/a studies department faculty and Associated Students (A.S.) officials were also present.</p>\n<p>Event organizer, Yaneli Gutierrez, distinguished A.S. executive director, Marisela Marquez as a staff member that has been a supporter of El Centro since her time as a graduate student on campus.</p>\n<p>Marquez told the story of the day she first visited El Centro in 1988. She said “it was the first time I had exhaled in three years.”</p>\n<p>“In the early years, I watched [students] negotiate and sell M&amp;M’s to actually create the first La Raza college day,” Marquez said, referring to when El Congreso, one of El Centro’s organizations, brings high school and middle school students of color to campus to introduce them to how higher education works.</p>\n<p>Marquez said the Chicanx and Latinx student population has gone from approximately 12 percent to over 25 percent and credited El Centro as a main reason for UCSB’s effectiveness as a Hispanic Serving Institution.</p>\n<p>Marquez emphasized that past and present generations of students have created a space where future students will retain what El Centro has to offer.</p>\n<p>“Without [the students’ work] we wouldn’t be standing here. Its known that the next generation of students are right behind you and they’re taking it to heart,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 19 print edition

His plan for a fiscal accountability task force would reallocate unused student funds for projects within A.S. and, if Dumlao follows through, could help ensure students’ money is not wasted. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With experience working with different groups on campus and a firm set of goals for his time as president of the association, Justice Dumlao demonstrates the leadership qualities that could improve A.S. from the top down.</p>\n<p>Dumlao has served as the co-chair of the A.S. Queer Commission, diversity education coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), a board member of the Student Affairs Student Council and a director for the Coalition for a Better UC.</p>\n<p>The candidate’s experience working in all corners of campus demonstrates his ability to communicate with both students and administration.</p>\n<p>Dumlao, a third-year global studies major, has a dedication to making A.S. more accessible to all students in a tangible way; he proposes hiring presidential liaisons from various communities on campus to work directly with his office.</p>\n<p>Dumlao also understands the importance of putting student money to good use. His plan for a fiscal accountability task force would reallocate unused student funds for projects within A.S. and, if Dumlao follows through, could help ensure students’ money is not wasted.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> is also interested in Dumlao’s idea to reform UCSB students’ healthcare.</p>\n<p>Dumlao wants Student Health to accept all major insurance providers, as he said the service currently only accepts Gaucho Health Insurance. Through Dumlao’s plan to incorporate UCSB into the UC Health system, more students will have access to Student Health services, regardless of their insurance plan.</p>\n<p>While Dumlao is an advocate for empowering student voices within the association and has long-term goals like healthcare reform, the candidate also understands the day-to-day lives of students on campus.</p>\n<p>Dumlao’s proposal to create community study spaces in the library would provide a location for students of shared majors to study and communicate, which he said will facilitate more dialogue among the student body.</p>\n<p>While vague in its implementation, Dumlao’s eagerness to create small- and large-scale change on campus is admirable in a presidential candidate, especially with a term limited to a school year.</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel, Dumlao’s opponent running with Campus United, is qualified for the job of president with her experience as an L&amp;S senator and an apparent dedication to equality for students.</p>\n<p>Yet Kopel’s primary concrete plan for a natural disaster relief program, while well-intentioned in its structure, does not compare with Dumlao’s presentation of multiple feasible ideas and projects.</p>\n<p>Dumlao should also remember to carry himself with the dignity of his position, as his conduct in opposing ideas he disagrees with has a strong possibility of causing rifts within the organization.</p>\n<p>Dumlao has ambitious goals and a series of plans for tangible projects, but the <em>Nexus</em> would like to remind the candidate to remain inclusive of all perspectives as the leader of the student body.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

the trips, like her opponent Madeline Loudon.</p>\n<p>According to the Associated Students legal code, the purpose of the external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) is to “serve as the

then-external vice president of local affairs, taking an active role campaigning for local self-governance efforts and being a serviceable helping hand to campus organizations as a student senator.</p>\n<p>If Dycaico can focus her organizing efforts on finding real-world solutions to the numerous problems affecting I.V., including safety and police presence, then her experience and knowledge of the community’s history will make her an effective EVPLA next year.</p>\n<p>The EVPLA is the executive A.S. representative for all things Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>As a first-year history of public policy major, Dycaico helped Third District Supervisor candidate Joan Hartmann register voters in the community. In the spring, she worked as the Community Services District (CSD) coordinator for the EVPLA office, months before the CSD became a reality.</p>\n<p>Dycaico spent that fall going door to door, asking people to vote on measures that would create both the district and a tax to fund it. She helped host a forum, held by the EVPLA office, featuring CSD Board of Directors candidates. Many of those candidates ended up on the board, but the CSD didn’t get its funding. This June, it will have another chance, and Dycaico is again campaigning for it.</p>\n<p>Since then, Dycaico has hunkered down on campus efforts. She was elected off-campus senator last spring. During her term, she is most proud of having been an effective liaison between the Senate and organizations like Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) and UCSB Lobby Corps.</p>\n<p>Rena Bahl, EAB co-chair, agreed Dycaico was a viable liaison who attended 75 percent of the org’s meetings — more than she was required to by A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>“She did a lot more than she was supposed to and put in way more effort than previous liaisons,” said Bahl, a third-year environmental studies and global studies major.</p>\n<p>During her <em>Nexus</em> endorsement interview, Dycaico proved she has a solid level of background knowledge of I.V.’s workings. She’s aware of current CSD projects and other I.V. fixtures like the Beloved Community conference and the I.V. Recreation and Parks District. Dycaico has formed opinions on tenant-landlord mediation and making Halloween safer.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Dycaico’s ideas for improving I.V. could use further work. Combatting I.V.’s burglary rates, she said, starts with giving its residents more replacement keys for their houses because too many are leaving their homes unlocked.</p>\n<p>Dycaico’s plan fails to consider that The Home Depot is only a 13-minute bicycle ride away from the southernmost block of I.V.</p>\n<p>Dycaico also introduced nothing new when it comes to engaging I.V.’s non-student population, including families and residents who do not speak English as a first language.</p>\n<p>Still, when it comes to understanding the projects already underway in I.V. and the bureaucratic tangles that may slow them down, Dycaico is the right candidate for the job. If she can get to know more of the folks in the community this summer and commit herself to understanding how they would like to be helped, Dycaico would do a fair job of representing the student population in I.V.</p>\n<p>Students can vote for Dycaico in the A.S. Elections by logging on to G.O.L.D. from April 23-26.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-72474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The memorandum of understanding will guarantee admission for all qualified transfer students from California Community Colleges, increasing the number of students at all nine UC campuses. Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>University of California President Janet Napolitano signed a joint agreement with California Community College Chancellor Eloy Ortiz Oakley to put forth a “comprehensive effort” to guarantee admission for qualified transfer students to all nine UC campuses.</p>\n<p>The memorandum of understanding (MOU), signed on April 11, will increase the number of Californians who pursue higher education, Oakley said in a press release.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said this collaboration with the community college system will allow for a “streamlined” transfer process for qualified students as well as prepare them for transitioning to the UC System.</p>\n<p>According to Napolitano, the UC system hopes to implement these changes and see the “tangible, positive” effects by Fall 2019.</p>\n<p>The agreement would guarantee a place in the UC system for transfer students who complete one of the UC pathways and earn the necessary grade point average (GPA). The UC transfer pathway is a roadmap that outlines courses that community college students should take to establish themselves as competitive candidates for transferring.</p>\n<p>Transfer Admission Guarantees (T.A.G.s) that already exist between students and each university will still be in place, according to the memorandum.</p>\n<p>UCSB already has a “campus-specific guarantee” in place to accommodate community college transfer students, but will “continue to work closely with transfer students to explain their options for enrolling into our guaranteed program,” said UCSB Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop.</p>\n<p>The MOU states the UC Academic Senate — in conjunction with the California Community Colleges Senate — agreed to accept students who earn an associate degree at a community college where their degree “meets or exceeds the major requirements in a UC transfer pathway for the same major.”</p>\n<p>Julie Bruno, president of the Academic Senate for CCC, emphasized the importance of students earning their associate’s degree in addition to successfully transferring to a UC.</p>\n<p>The MOU sets forth several partnerships and programs to help community college students —particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds — meet the academic standards necessary for UC admission.</p>\n<p>Partnerships to enhance transfer students’ preparation for enrollment in the UC system include a UC campus summer program for prospective transfers and summer bridge programs for admitted students.</p>\n<p>The agreement highlights the importance of prioritizing transfer students and argues that this is a responsibility shared among all institutions of higher education.</p>\n<p>One of the actions outlined in the MOU calls for increased training for faculty to help them better serve transfer students and understand their specific needs.</p>\n<p>The most recent MOU builds upon previous MOUs, particularly one from 1996 that led to an increase in enrollment of CCC students by over 50 percent. In the last four admission cycles alone, the UC increased its transfer enrollment by 20 percent, reaching an all-time high of 20,000 transfer students in Fall 2017, according to the MOU.</p>\n<p>The agreement says the UC Academic Senate will be responsible for reporting annual data regarding the admissions guarantees to the UC Board of Regents in order to better ensure accountability.

They are the only candidates on this year’s ballot who are running independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both currently work within A.S. Ettleson is currently the chief of staff within the OSA, while Martinez is a letters and science senator within the A.S. Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the issues addressed during Monday’s S.A.G. debate:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>TRANSPARENCY</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said she would be as transparent as she can be with case work due to the confidential nature of the information within the office, but will be “as transparent as possible with [her] own work” and what students’ needs are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez was not present to answer the first question as she arrived late.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>ROLE</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez described the S.A.G. as someone who is “willing to speak out for communities who have historically been silenced on campus” and is focused on making A.S. more accessible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said the role of S.A.G. is complex and focuses on helping students with issues such as housing policy and violations of student code of conduct, as well as helping students navigate issues with the administration. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>EXPERIENCE</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson explained her role as the OSA’s chief of staff, working “with the operations of the office, advocating for students’ needs in the association and throughout the community [and] working with the current Student Advocate General.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said that, as a senator, she has served on the housing committee, created the first international student BCU, the first public and mental health commission and was the only senator to serve on the housing and textbook affordability committee.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>PRESSING ISSUES STUDENTS FACE</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Martinez, the biggest issue students face is making higher education more accessible due to the problems under the current Trump administration, specifically for students who come from marginalized and disadvantaged communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said the most pressing problem students have faced this past year is “how many issues are being [dealt with],” including food insecurity, housing problems, increasing tuition and various legal issues. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>PARTISANSHIP</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about partisanship within the UCSB community, Ettleson said this position requires “putting the job first and yourself second” in order to remove personal interests from the matters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez referenced Ettleson’s point, emphasizing that the job is number one and that regardless of political affiliations, the “ability to make a difference in somebody’s life and the ability to change and make or break somebody’s career” comes above all.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>IMPROVING S.A.G.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said she wants to make sure the office is operating at maximum effectiveness with “increased sufficiency.” She explained that she would like office hours to be held in other spaces on campus to increase accessibility and implement programs that would reduce the number of housing and student code of conduct violations, specifically aiming to make OSA a household name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said she would like to expand on the current S.A.G.’s polling project by implementing community organizers who would then specifically work to target first-year students. “[I want to] tailor our resources, our programs and our outreach to make sure that the services the office offers [are beneficial],” she said.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>INVOLVEMENT IN A.S. IF NOT ELECTED</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If not elected, Ettleson said she would “try and be involved in Associated Students in any way that would help me continue some of the work that needs to be done” and help bridge the gap between Associated Students and the rest of the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said she would focus her energy on making sure that the BCUs she created are up and running and would continue to make sure that her work as a senator would “continue regardless of the position that [she holds.]”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 52 A.S. candidates will be up shortly.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Martinez said she was the only senator to serve on the housing and textbook affordability committee, not the textbook affordability community. She created the first public and mental health committee, not the first mental health committee, as previously stated. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

multipurpose room to discuss current and future UC Santa Barbara mascots. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 20 students gathered at the Student Resource Building’s multipurpose room to discuss their issues with UCSB’s current mascot, the gaucho, or an Argentinian cowboy. Students expressed concern that UCSB negatively represents Argentinian people by using caricaturesque features like a mask and grimacing face on “Olé,” the mascot that appears at UCSB sports matches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ani Vahalia, second-year biology major, said during the town hall that explaining the university’s current mascot to other people is “really awkward” because it appears to be representing a “racial trope.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vahalia said that, considering a significant part of the student population is Hispanic, the problems with Olé and UCSB’s tradition of throwing tortillas at soccer games are “kind of obvious.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why is that our mascot? Is it any better than… the Redskins?… A lot of our student population are people of color who have dealt with slurs and awkward representation,” Vahalia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hailey Phelan, a fourth-year global studies major and one of the event’s organizers, said that many people have recommended replacing the gaucho with a raccoon, but said the word “raccoon” itself can contain a slur which could also become problematic in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"http://www.ucsbgauchos.com/fan_zone/Locos/nickname\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">university’s athletics website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the university settled on the gaucho as its nickname in 1936 after the female student population voted to change the mascot from the roadrunner because of the 1927 film “The Gaucho.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1980s, “Gaucho Joe” became an iconic figure in cheering on the team at basketball games, and in the 1990s basketball fans became famous for throwing tortillas on the court during games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the athletics website, the tortillas “often stopped </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">play and resulted in technical foul calls against the Gauchos.” In 1997, UCSB’s basketball coach was ejected from a game against the University of the Pacific after failing to control the tortilla-throwing crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student showed support for the current mascot and said he does not see the gaucho as an offensive figure, but rather a symbol of values from a distinct set of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cristian Zapata, a third-year biopsychology major, said that as someone of Argentinian heritage, he does not believe the gaucho is “racist.” Zapata said gauchos are a group of people “represent[ing] freedom and virility” and should be seen as a unique subculture — a group of people who chose not to adapt to modern lifestyles and live in the rural countryside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said that the name Olé is fitting for UCSB because the commonly-used phrase is a part of the prominent soccer culture in both Argentina and the university. Zapata said that gauchos eat a form of bread similar to the tortilla, making UCSB’s sports tradition very fitting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leanne Friedrich, a graduate student studying materials in the engineering department, said regardless of whether the mascot is verifiably “racist,” students’ interpretation of the mascot as such is “completely distracting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phelan suggested the possibility of keeping the gaucho as a mascot but rebranding its imagery to be historically accurate by dressing the mascot in appropriate clothing, perhaps portraying them on horseback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the main difficulties in changing UCSB’s mascot rest on the financial impact a rebranding could have on the university, specifically on its intercollegiate athletics departments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Phelan, the athletics department has said the university’s mascot needs to be intimidating to other sports teams, explaining Olé’s aggressive appearance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Samantha Stopol, a fourth-year economics major, said she believes the gaucho is a folk hero in South America and a proud figure but said she believes Olé should be redesigned because the mask he wears makes him look like a criminal and provides a negative image. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phelan also said many of the university’s online domains such as GauchoSpace would also need to be renamed and relicensed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the athletic and financial repercussions that a mascot change could have, Phelan noted that alumni feel an attachment to the Gaucho name, which should be considered when proposing a change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, Dean of Student ife, also spoke about student’s perception of the mascot and suggested students tie values they respect to the mascot, regardless of whether it is changed in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event’s organizers Phelan, Mario Infante, a fourth-year computer science major, and James Ferraro, a first-year history major, said they held Friday evening’s town hall in order to facilitate the discussion around the current mascot but were not advocating for a specific change.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ferraro is a first-year history major, not a history of public policy major. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Elections Board chair, said Le was likely referring to the A.S. Elections Board and that the board cannot release any information until after elections because it is confidential. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Le had previously refused to comment on whether he asked intoxicated students to sign a petition at a party after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">obtained a video of him allegedly doing so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall featured a panel of individuals involved with the project, including architect Jean Gaff from Pfeiffer Architects and Mark Nocciolo, director of capital development at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel discussed what the building would look like and ended with a question and answer session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel also presented a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K__5LUTYlqo&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three-dimensional model</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of what the new building </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/newcen-to-create-innovation-lab-pedestrian-path/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would look like</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “NewCen,” as Le has dubbed the project, would include an expansion into Corwin Pavilion and several “student-focused social spaces” that would make “it feel much more connected to the outdoors,” Gaff said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The whole idea is to activate this area so it’s all about the students [to] give it more of a feeling of this is where you want to be as a student,” she told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in an interview before the town hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the town hall, Gaff explained that the concept is still in very early planning stages and that there has been no “formal report” on the environmental impacts the project would have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is all high level to show you the types of spaces that could be accommodated, the breadth of what you could do in terms of renovations and expansions,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If students vote yes on the project, student fees will rise an additional $20.40 per quarter from Fall 2018 to Fall 2022.

would fund the fledgling government’s operations by imposing an eight percent tax on electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services. The ballot measure will be on Isla Vistans’ June 5, 2018, primary election ballot.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD was created on Nov. 9, 2016, after the passage of Measure E with an overwhelming 87 percent of the vote, but the new government was deprived of financial stability when Measure F failed to garner the necessary 66.67 percent of the vote, falling short by about six percent.</p>\n<p>Measure R is essentially a second attempt to pass a user utility tax (UUT), the same goal Measure F sought to accomplish in 2016. The ballot language for the measure has changed since the UUT’s first appearance at the polls, though only slightly.</p>\n<p>While on the 2016 ballot, Measure F included the contingency that the UUT would go into effect with the creation of a then-nebulous CSD. Measure R now lists the particular services the tax would fund.</p>\n<p>According to the ballot language registered with the county’s clerk-recorder, the UUT would explicitly fund any of the following services: improvements to parking, public safety, lighting and sidewalks.</p>\n<p>The tax could also be used to provide tenant mediation services, create a municipal advisory council and operate facilities like the Community Room the CSD currently meets at for its twice-monthly board meetings and the burgeoning Community Center.</p>\n<p>In order to place Measure R on the June primary ballot, the CSD Board of Directors first voted on the language citizens would see on their voting slips and then submitted the proposed question to the County of Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors, which later approved the phrasing at a board meeting.</p>\n<p>Since its creation, the CSD has found its organizational framework, hired legal counsel, expanded the Community Service Organization’s escort services, piloted a tenant mediation program with the Santa Barbara Legal Aid Foundation and hired an interim General Manager, all while operating mainly on a $200,000 donation from UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus </em>on Wednesday, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand said the key difference between the 2016 vote and this year’s is that the CSD has found its footing, proving it can do a lot with a little.</p>\n<p>Support for Measure R is mounting within student activist networks and some government circles. UC Santa Barbara’s Campus Democrats began campaigning for the measure last Monday, while the “Yes on Measure R” campaign has been active since mid-March.</p>\n<p>While the I.V. Recreation and Parks District has not made an official statement supporting the measure, Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann issued a statement on Wednesday “strongly in support” of Measure R. Hartmann has personally contributed $6,000 toward the campaign and will actively fundraise and canvass for its passage, she said.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said the measure’s passage would allow for the CSD to thrive and provide effective services to its unique demographic.</p>\n<p>“Due to its great density, diversity, poverty level, and demographics dominated by a young student population … Isla Vista has an even greater need for services and infrastructure than other unincorporated areas in the County,” Hartmann said in her statement.</p>\n<p>While proponents of the tax have sought to spread their message through door-to-door canvassing and tabling, opponents have voiced their displeasure toward the tax<sub>,</sub> primarily through flyers.</p>\n<p>Chuck Eckert, treasurer of anti-UUT group Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes, told the <em>Nexus</em> on Wednesday that the group has been distributing flyers advocating for a “no” vote on the measure.</p>\n<p>The flyers claim that I.V. residents’ taxes are far too high and calls on them to voice their dissent. The exact cost of the UUT for individual residents is still undetermined, according to CSD Secretary and Director Spencer Brandt. The CSD plans to present a revenue estimate at their next board meeting, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Eckert said he is against the measure’s passage because he believes the I.V. government does not need additional funding “to do what they have already done.” He also said services like tenant mediation duplicate already available services like the Community Housing Office and other resources offered by UCSB and the County of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The building was deemed unstable in 2017 due to various structural problems, promting students and alumni to call for its repair and the preservation of its history. <em>Kaitlyn Ngyuen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>El Centro, which sits on sunken ground between the library and Broida Hall, has historically been a gathering place for Latinx students and activists. The building provides working space for campus organizations including M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB, El Congreso, Students for Justice in Palestine and the conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>The reconstruction cost approximately $900,000, funded by Student Affairs and partially funded by the deferred maintenance program.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day vacate notice after a report from the Van Sande Structural Consultant group confirmed various structural issues including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>After the eviction notice, students and alumni voiced their frustration toward the administration for seemingly ignoring the requests of the occupants to repair the building, according to Shahryar Mooraj, a fourth-year mathematical science and physics double major and member of the El Centro Committee.</p>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/\">passed a resolution</a> a few weeks later that supported the restoration of the building and by April 2017 the administration had decided against the demolition of the historic building.</p>\n<p>A committee of students and administrators was then created to discuss the conditions of the new building and to discuss what was needed.</p>\n<p>“As students, we came together to stop that and to fight for the history and the culture that has been built in that space over time and to ensure that El Centro has a permanent physical space on campus,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>The space was created as a response to the lack of representation and support from the UCSB administration for the Latinx community, which additionally led to the creation of the Chicana/o Studies department and support programs like EOP, according to Mooraj.</p>\n<p>A 10-day hunger strike by Chicanx student activists in 1994 pushed the UCSB administration to make El Centro a permanent space after the trailer had been given a life-span of 10 years and had not been considered a permanent building.</p>\n<p>“The space of El Centro was allocated in the late ’70s, early ’80s to give students of color a place to congregate, a place to meet where they could feel welcomed on campus during a time when that really wasn’t the case,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>“Since then, it’s been a center for community organizing and activism in terms of fighting for different things that students need,” he added.</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, students at El Centro continually fought for the permanency and improvement of the building, including insect and mold inspections and requests for a hydration station, which was eventually installed late 2016.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the entire portion of the building that was previously a trailer was remodeled, except for the wood stud walls and plywood siding and the wood roof rafters and plywood roofing.</p>\n<p>The trailer now has a concrete foundation, a drainage system to prevent flooding during the rainy season and new wiring that improves the lights and Wi-Fi connection in the building.</p>\n<p>Mooraj said that some offices were remodeled to create a conference room and a kitchen. Ten feet of space was also added to the main activity room.</p>\n<p>New furniture, monitors and salvaged art pieces from the original building now adorn the reconstructed student hub.</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, the new building is expected to be a permanent location for El Centro, and there will be regular upkeep and maintenance.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and Early Academic Outreach Program are currently operating from the building. A psychologist from Counseling and Psychological Services will also be accessible on the first floor of the building.</p>\n<p>“We have a signed agreement with the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and other administration that El Centro will be a permanent physical space and that it will remain where it is today,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

email from what looked like the school, and it directed me to a link,” Padilla said. “Of course I was going to open it because I’m always on the lookout for emails from professors or anything campus-related.”</p>\n<p>A few days after clicking the link, Padilla received at least 3,000 emails and 40 Facebook messages regarding the false job offer, most of them from people asking for more information and even sending full resumes.</p>\n<p>Like Padilla, many UCSB students can suffer from these scams when they mistake faulty emails for official university announcements.</p>\n<p>Phishing is a form of social engineering that takes place through email with the ultimate goal of acquiring someone’s personal information, according to Sam Horowitz, UCSB’s chief security information officer.</p>\n<p>Despite posting a warning on UCSB’s “Free &amp; For Sale” page on Facebook and having UCSB’s Student Information Systems and Technology help reset her U-Mail information, Padilla says she still occasionally gets spam and emails relating to the scam.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t satisfied with the help desk. They reset my U-Mail, and I tried to show them that I was still getting spam, but it seemed like they didn’t believe me. They were helpful in resetting but even then I’m still wondering how our security is so compromised,” she said.</p>\n<p>Horowitz explained that there is little the help desk can do when someone falls victim to a phishing attack.</p>\n<p>“If you respond to a phishy message, they’re going to send you more messages because they know you respond. The help desk can’t fully prevent when the student declared themselves to be a soft target,” he said.</p>\n<p>Horowitz said that there is no clear answer as to how scammers obtained U-Mail information since some technology is untraceable and there are limitations to detecting online activity.</p>\n<p>He said, however, that possibilities could include leaks through students’ distribution mailing lists or computer malware.</p>\n<p>“The best way to tell if an email is a phishing scam is that if it expresses any sort of urgency or threat,” Horowitz said. “If it’s too good to be true, or if it’s really urgent and threatens, be circumspect about it. Have a skeptical mind to recognize when you’re being fooled. Students need to look out all the time.”</p>\n<p>Shea Lovan, associate director of UCSB’s Enterprise Technology Services, said that while he does not have phishing-specific statistics, “Office 365 blocks an average of 2.7 million pieces of spam and just under 5,000 pieces of malware destined for U-Mail accounts every month.”</p>\n<p>Phone call scams claiming ransom have also been targeting students and citizens throughout Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Large reports of phone calls involving IRS impersonators and virtual kidnapping instances are on the rise, according to a press release from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Virtual kidnapping scams involve contacting a family member and claiming to have kidnapped someone close to them before demanding ransom payment.</p>\n<p>“The best way to combat these calls is to educate the public,” SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover said.</p>\n<p>“Anytime we send information out about these phone scams, it appears that it scares off the scammers for a time before they flare back up again,” she added.</p>\n<p>To avoid falling victim for phone scams, Hoover advises to simply hang up the phone.</p>\n<p>“If anybody calls you claiming to be from any agency and asks you for financial information or mentions that you owe something, just hang up and call the agency to make sure that this person is legitimate,” she said.</p>\n<p>If students have been victims of phishing, they should visit <em>security.ucsb.edu</em> to report the issue.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 3 of the April 12, 2018

Bike shop. The total cost of the project and sources of funding are still undetermined. Irene Chen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“I think this project is transformational in its scope,” said Mark Nocciolo, director of capital development at UC Santa Barbara. Nocciolo has overseen early renovation plans and worked with the architect and Associated Students (A.S.) to help visualize the project.</p>\n<p>“The intent is to try to redefine the University Center to be less like a mall and more like a student union. Anybody who has been to any Division 1 campus would recognize that there’s usually a university center that’s more student-oriented than ours is,” he explained.</p>\n<p>The model was developed by Nocciolo and Jean Gaff, managing principal of Pfeiffer Architects.</p>\n<p>The plans radically change and “revitalize” the University Center (UCen) into a “NewCen,” according to A.S. President Hieu Le.</p>\n<p>“Today’s Student Affairs’ (S.A.) service needs substantially exceed the capacity of S.A. facilities, compromising functionality, collaborations and staff and student well-being,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The renovated UCen would include a new “innovation lab” where students could collaborate on projects, a “demonstration kitchen” in which chefs would offer cooking lessons and connectivity kiosks, in which students tabling for their organizations would have a space to set up shop.</p>\n<p>These features are in addition to elements previously described on the project’s ballot measure, such as expanded space for the A.S. Food Bank, Campus Learning and Assistive Services (CLAS) and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</p>\n<p>The 3D model additionally projects an expanded Wellness Center, which currently exists inside Student Health. As <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/stagnant-2-million-fund-could-offset-ucen-project-costs-fees-will-still-rise-after-inflation/\">previously reported</a>, the building would also include a migrated A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>The project would also include a new “pedestrian zone” adjacent to the building, which would allow more space for people walking through on campus tours.</p>\n<p>Several areas of the current UCen, such as the bookstore, Starbucks and some of the food areas, will remain in business throughout construction, Le said.</p>\n<p>Since the project was first proposed, students have disputed how much it would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">actually cost</a>, while information about the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/\">state of the current UCen</a> and Le’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/petition/\">petitioning methods</a> have been controversial topics across the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>If students vote to pass the project, student fees will be increased $20.40 per quarter from Fall 2018 until Fall 2022. From Fall 2022 to Fall 2052, students will pay an additional $96.06 per quarter.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of alumni donations, student fees and the university itself, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“At this current state we don’t know [exactly how much people will pay] because there are a lot of factors, such as donations,” he said.</p>\n<p>This is the third time an A.S. president has created a UCen renovation plan. During the 2013-14 school year, then-President Jonathan Abboud developed a similar plan that would have expanded space in the UCen to allocate more space to campus services. The plan failed on the spring ballot.</p>\n<p>Another failed UCen renovation, proposed in 2011, would have expanded third-floor study space. In 2012, then-President Harrison Weber created a plan for an entirely new building, a Student Engagement Center. Students voted down the fee initiative in the spring election.</p>\n<p>While the organization of different spaces has varied in the different UCen plans, the concept has remained fairly consistent, Nocciolo said.</p>\n<p>He noted that the latest renovation project differs from the previous ones because it addresses infrastructural problems that are reportedly plaguing the facility.</p>\n<p>Students will vote on this project in April 23-26. If it passes, planning likely will begin immediately, according to Le.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
