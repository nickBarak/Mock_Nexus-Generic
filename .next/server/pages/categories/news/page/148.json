President Harrison Weber’s veto of the organization’s amended Elections Code.</p>\n<p>Weber struck the bill down after the representatives unanimously voted in its favor last week on the grounds that many of its provisions — such as a ban on A.S. officials’ candidate endorsements — violated First Amendment rights. The committee modifies the code every year to ensure fair and equitable campaigning for students interested in running in elections during Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Weber, campus legal counsel Nancy G. Hamill also flagged certain legal ramifications in the new Elections Code that could potentially face legal challenge if the veto is overridden.</p>\n<p>“I did not want to do a veto, [and] I believe a veto should not be thrown around like it’s not a big deal,” Weber said. “But things like the Elections Committee exist for a reason — and the veto exists for a reason, and I felt there were some things that really needed to be addressed.”</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Elections Committee Chair Courtney Axner said the council supports an override of the veto without further alterations by a two-thirds vote of the council.</p>\n<p>“We support him fully, and I think he is a great President, [but] in all honesty we’re just … trying to work the process out,” Axner said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the ban unnecessarily prevents officials from favoring candidates, Weber said.</p>\n<p>“The endorsement question does not have any legitimate educational purpose because students are only told what certain officials think of candidates,” Weber said. “Student-Advocate General endorsements are only as good as the credibility behind the endorsement. It is not just like a rubber stamp that says: you got my endorsement, you got the position.”</p>\n<p>According to Weber, the endorsements help prevent the election of “an outside person without any regulation [who] can do damage to the office and the services it provides.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Marlene Moreno said biased endorsements may sway voters and create an unequal arena for candidates without connections in the association.</p>\n<p>“[The] Student Advocate General should not be able to endorse views because [Weber] has a very idealistic view that a hundred percent of the students will know what a Student General does,” Moreno said. “I have faith in students but people will take titles at face value.”</p>\n<p>Weber also requested the committee clarify its ambiguous definition of “defamation” and what constitutes “offensive or inappropriate” language as well as re-evaluate its restriction of the campaigning period to two weeks due to its possible limitation on free speech.</p>\n<p>However, Axner said candidates’ unique position as students and politicians requires extra consideration.</p>\n<p>“Nationally, presidents can campaign whenever they want, but our concern is that we are students first before we are any elected position,” Axner said. “By [establishing a] limited two-week period of campaigning, it gives students ample time to say ‘I’m a student first, and then the two weeks I’m going to work really hard for the position I want.’”</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Nate Walker said the Council should take Weber’s recommendations into consideration to avoid placing itself in a legal dispute.</p>\n<p>“I trust that if we make rational amendments to the bill that are in the interest in the students, Harrison will not veto it again,” Walker said. “We let the veto go through, we put this in old-business, we make all amendments and add in the Elections Code verbiage.”</p>\n<p>The issue remained unresolved as of press time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to witness reports, the 19-year-old male said he was going for a quick dip in the Pacific. However, his friends’ reported they were confident he did not know how to swim and forgot his floaties at home.</p>\n<p>After arriving on the 6500 block of Del Playa, officers attempted to prevent the subject from going down to the beach and escort him back to a securely landlocked patrol car. However, the aquatics enthusiast resisted officers’ attempts to shepherd him away from the sea, proclaiming his desire to “look at the offshore oil rigs”.</p>\n<p>Officers reported the subject’s decibel level rarely dropped below shouting volume. Despite the risk of ruptured eardrums, IVFP learned from the would-be-merman he had consumed “about 4 beers” after suffering estrangement from his significant other.</p>\n<p>IVFP eventually managed to get the subject into a patrol car.

For many students, this was one of the most educational parts of the day.</p>\n<p>Rojon Atapour, a fifth-year political science major and current co-president of OTI, said the diversity of perspectives in the group made for enlightening discussions.</p>\n<p>“Even though as a group we all sat down with the very same speakers, it is amazing the interpretation people got of what was being said or the message that a certain speaker was giving, in even understanding overall what they were trying to convey to us,” Atapour said. “It is amazing how you could just be sitting with the same people and completely get a different interpretation of what was being said.”</p>\n<p>Atapour said the environments and communities in which students were raised had direct effects on their perceptions of the trip’s experiences.</p>\n<p>“The best way to put it is because of our backgrounds, be it our major or our religious beliefs or our family or our community or whatever it is, these are like certain lenses we see things through, so when the speakers are talking to us we will see things through lenses we are familiar with seeing,” Atapour said. “But by going through Reflections we get to see it through other peoples’ lenses and gain a much bigger understanding of how different people interpret and analyze information.”</p>\n<p>The open narrative promoted by the Olive Tree Initiative has drawn criticism from some viewpoints advocating strongly for one side or the other. Ha-Emet — a student, faculty and community organization concerned with the effects of OTI on the Jewish community — has taken issue with several aspects of the program, including their meetings and association with individuals who have expressed anti-Israeli views.</p>\n<p>Co-President Timna Medovoy, a second-year global and international studies major, said the gulf between extreme views can make OTI an easy target for either side.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that this is a very, very polarized conflict,” Medovoy. “We kind of try to be this neutral position and we try hard to be bipartisan and to be non-biased on all these things, but when two sides are so polarized it is very easy for either side to claim that we have bias. A lot of people who are on either side do not necessarily want the sides talking.”</p>\n<p>Graduate advisor Mike Schwartz, a second-year graduate student in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, agreed with Medovoy and said extreme viewpoints could be uncomfortable with any organization that listens to the other side.</p>\n<p>“Everyone wants to tell their stories if it is the truth,” Schwartz said. “When you tell a story where it is less clear where the blame falls … both sides will be uncomfortable with you saying anything other than ‘my version is right.’”</p>\n<p>However, Medovoy — a citizen of both Israel and the U.S. — said local reactions to the program were overwhelmingly positive, albeit surprised. Medovoy said several shopkeepers were particularly shocked to see the easygoing relationships between students from disparate backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“Every time we walked into a store, the store owners were like ‘Wait, what are you doing together?’” Medovoy said. “Because I would speak Hebrew and she would speak Arabic … every time people would hear us speaking two different languages and walking together they would say, ‘What are you doing together, how do you know each other?’”</p>\n<p>In a region defined by conflict for over 60 years, religious and cultural differences can become ingrained into the identities of the groups involved. According to Atapour, the Olive Tree Initiative brings students connected to or interested in the conflict to the center of the issues at hand, providing a unique perspective and forum for all points of view.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a virtue as California students being detached from the region and our political disposition does not necessarily correlate with a religious or ethnic identity; oftentimes it does influence it, but the conflict is not a daily thing for us,” Atapour said. “For me it’s just normal to have many Jewish and Muslim friends growing up in LA … We live in California — it is a very diverse community. This is what is normal. In the Middle East or in other parts of the world — but especially in Israel and Palestine, as a whole — communities usually stick with each other. To have this level of diversity is not common, especially where these communities more often than not are at odds with one another.”</p>\n<p>Atapour said this gap between cultures, often given tangible form by physical barricades separating groups, is a major obstacle for peace.</p>\n<p>According to Atapour, “[The problem] is the lack of positive exposure and the lack of inter-faith, inter-ethnic groups studying together at school or living among each other and yielding a positive thing as opposed to a conflicting environment.”</p>\n<p><em>This is the third and final installment of the feature titled The Olive Tree Initiative.

Foot Patrol officers apprehended a suspect — dressed, painted and hair-sprayed entirely green — on suspicion of public intoxication and disorderly conduct shortly after midnight on Nov. 1.</p>\n<p>After the jolly green reveler noticed that he had caught the attention of local authorities, he strolled into oncoming traffic in opposition to officers’ requests that he accompany them to the curb for a sobriety test and narrowly avoided being struck by a westbound vehicle. The emerald escapist then fled on foot up Del Playa Drive, promptly colliding with a stop sign on the corner of Camino Pescadero.</p>\n<p>However, the Green Lantern never gives up without a fight and, in a superhuman feat of agility, remained upright and continued his flight with several deputies in pursuit.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the hope that his green face paint and hair coloring would serve as better camouflage off the street, the fleet-footed suspect sought refuge in a nearby residence on DP. As the cops followed him into the house, he made a ninja turtle-worthy leap over the back fence into another nearby residence.</p>\n<p>Following the indignant cries of the Del Playa residents — none of whom wished to press trespassing charges — officers eventually apprehended the mischievous leprechaun inside a third DP residence.</p>\n<p>Upon his arrest, the captured fugitive articulated that he wanted to provide deputies with a formal statement. However, after the suspect was transferred to the I.V. Foot Patrol station for processing, his remarks were found to be incoherent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/","id":3818,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3817,3816,3815],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Seek Peaceful Solutions","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Oren Ofer and Timna Medovoy both carry dual citizenship to the United States and Israel.

Strauss Foundation, a program that funds public service projects, in hopes of starting such an organization on campus. After learning about the OTI’s similar goals through a student leader summit on the issue, Ofer and fellow Gaucho Saleh Abdulla — at the time the co-president of the Muslim Student Association — helped bring OTI to the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>“When we presented our initial idea around the university, our kind of thing was: an ex-Israeli Defense Force soldier and a Yemeni Muslim … and co-president of the Muslim Student Association are trying to work together to bring this incredible experience to other UCSB students and to the UCSB community,” Ofer said.</p>\n<p>According to Ofer, OTI stepped in to provide a “middle ground” between some of the viewpoints on campus.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t want the conflict to be perpetuated on our campus,” Ofer said. “There’s enough conflict going around and as students, we are going to be making the policy in the future … It is really important that we are educated on these issues so we can make positive influences when we are in those positions.”</p>\n<p>Over the summer of 2010, Ofer and fellow UCSB student Omer Harari traveled with OTI to the Middle East. Last summer, Co-Presidents Atapour and Medovoy, together with Mousa and graduate advisor Mike Schwartz, doubled the previous number of UCSB delegates to the Olive Tree Initiative and are currently active in the growing organization on campus.</p>\n<p><em>This is the second of three installments of the feature titled The Olive Tree Initiative.

Several students approached the podium during the public forum and argued that the council ignored the student body’s interests.</p>\n<p>Additionally, one speaker placed responsibility for the council’s decision on Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker due to her tie-breaking vote. Although Stryker said she supports the SOCC, she does not believe A.S.’s special projects budget should finance the conference.</p>\n<p>Stryker said she offered to dedicate $600 from her office’s funds toward the conference but did not receive a request from the group until Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter said the council’s debate focused on the appropriateness of using the special projects budget rather than the SOCC’s goals.</p>\n<p>Walter asked student attendees for input to help prove the council’s support after hearing numerous speakers.</p>\n<p>“Would you like it if we make a public statement of support, perhaps published in the Nexus — hopefully, if the Nexus will run it — would that make be a sufficient show of support?” Walter said.</p>\n<p>However, SOCC speakers said a public statement would only serve as an appeasement.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Sophia Armen, who chose to address the council as a student body member, said the student government’s endorsement for such events is vital for the campus community.</p>\n<p>“Support folks that do good shit! Students of color are disproportionately marginalized [and] they have to go through so much every day,” Armen said. “Being in this room, sitting at this table is a privilege. You are no longer acting for yourself; you are acting in consideration of other people … The climate of this room is not progressing us towards making this a more inclusive association.”</p>\n<p>In light of the council’s $145 Oct. 27 allocation toward the Campus Democrats, A.S. President Harrison Weber said the issue provokes a larger discussion on the council budget’s intended use.</p>\n<p>“The council needs to define what [its] special projects [budget] is for,” Weber said. “It sends a mixed message that the role of special projects isn’t to fund groups, but another group was funded. Also, I think it speaks to the larger issue: we need to have more discussion outside of this council.”</p>\n<p>The council had yet to discuss the bills and resolutions on last night’s agenda including legislation to restructure the External Vice President of Local Affairs, IVP and CAB Foundation offices as of press time.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/","id":3097,"author":{"id":202,"name":"Yishian Yao"},"related":[3096,3095,3094],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Campus Group Puts a Spin on Studying Abroad","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Our goal is to go on the trip and learn and meet people with different perspectives and open our own eyes,” graduate advisor for the Olive Tree Initiative, Mike Schwartz, said. “But we also can...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Untitled-42.jpg?resize=353%2C155\" alt=\"\" width=\"353\" height=\"155\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">“Our goal is to go on the trip and learn and meet people with different perspectives and open our own eyes,” graduate advisor for the Olive Tree Initiative, Mike Schwartz, said. “But we also can do a service for the people that we are meeting with just by showing that we come from such different backgrounds, but we can come together and learn together and be friends — like actually be friends.”</p>\n<p>Crammed into a small room in the Daily Nexus office beside Schwartz were fellow UCSB students Rojon Atapour, Timna Medovoy and Ahmed Mousa, who flew from Washington, D.C. to Tel Aviv this summer and spent 18 days traveling across Israel, Palestine and Jordan listening to testimony on the current conflict from various points of view.</p>\n<p>Schwartz, Atapour, Medovoy and Mousa are members of the Olive Tree Initiative, a program that sends UC students abroad to learn from and listen to every perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

One year later, Wehrenfennig and 15 fellow UCI students and two faculty members left the West Coast for the Middle East on OTI’s inaugural trip.</p>\n<p>Upon his return from OTI’s maiden voyage, Wehrenfennig said the program’s feedback made it obvious that the Initiative had found a niche in the UC system.</p>\n<p>“It very soon became clear that there is really a huge need to continue that kind of educational response to the questions that we have to deal with on campus when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Wehrenfennig said.</p>\n<p>The program has since expanded to six UC campuses, but only Irvine, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Santa Cruz have sent students abroad. Two new chapters at Berkeley and San Diego are gearing up to send their first delegates this upcoming summer.</p>\n<p>During the most recent expedition, the student diplomats spoke with royalty and servicemen, including a former Israel Defense Forces soldier on one day and the prince of Jordan on another — and often met with up to six or seven individuals each day, covering a wide range of opinions on the conflict.</p>\n<p>Atapour, a fourth-year political science major and co-president of OTI, said that unlike many other campus groups that discuss contemporary Middle Eastern issues, the organization goes to great lengths to remain unbiased toward any single point of view or political opinion.</p>\n<p>“Overall, the most important thing is to have this outlet on campus that people [can] go to that emphasizes education and not political advocacy,” Atapour said.</p>\n<p><em>This is the first of three installments of the Olive Tree Initiative feature.

Summoning his inner wild side, the juiced juvenile used the bottle as his personal machete and took a determined swing at one officer. While Pineapple Skyy may be good at knocking out freshmen just graduating from wine coolers, it was significantly less effective on trained law enforcement officials; the suspect was quickly disarmed and muzzled up with a personal pair of handcuffs.</p>\n<p>Despite his constraints, the fermented-fruit-sipping fiend was not yet ready to throw in the towel. When officers discovered a glass bottle of marijuana in the boy’s pocket, he took advantage of the distraction and, having already lost the fight, went with the other instinct and scrambled down Sabado Tarde Road with his hands still cuffed. Though cuffs can often make people quicker in the bedroom, the same cannot be said for the cantering criminal, who was quickly chased down and tackled … again.</p>\n<p>The suspect ended his tropical tonic-fueled adventures along with several other primal pals in the Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42565\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42565\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/","id":3817,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3816,3815,3814],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Trick or Treat?

Channel our favorite Brits, David Beckham and Posh Spice — you know you’ve thought about how great their sex has to be — and you’ll be fornicating like never before … all fierce and repulsively good-looking. And I’m not talking about soccer when I say bend it like Beckham. Spice up your life people — just like math, sex is the same in every country.</p>\n<p>There’s something about role playing that’s somewhat insightful. Your closet sex addict has a way of surfacing under the facade of your character and its honestly quite liberating — you may never admit to yourself that you have that alter ego (Boo, you whore), so the seductive burlesque costume is the perfect disguise.</p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, we all love Halloween. There’s a reason we’re already plotting next year’s scantily clad outfits. So, why wait a full year to dress up when you’ve got a perfectly good excuse to do so in the bedroom?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42460\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42460\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/","id":3504,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3503,3502,3501],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“So, tell me what you know about oral sex”","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In 2006, Oprah Winfrey sent suburban mothers across the nation into frenzy with her exposé on the oral sex epidemic unique to America’s youth.

Oprah — in her infinite wisdom and grace — broached the subject with a dramatic and weighted, “Parents, brace yourself.” I never saw the full episode, but can only assume Oprah proceeded to depict a scene in which sixteen-year-old girls, such as myself at the time, were gobbling penises by the dozen. Within a week of the program, my two best friends and I had all received the “you-aren’t-doing-this-are-you?” confrontation from our respective mothers.</p>\n<p>I now realize conversations of this nature must have been as uncomfortable for my poor mother as they were for me. The moments before beginning this sort of conversation must be like standing at a precipice, filled with dread and butterflies. Finally, she would garner enough courage and dive right into the topic with what came off as little tact or consideration.</p>\n<p>“So, tell me what you know about oral sex.” What? Shit. Where is this coming from? Blindsided! What is the right answer? Should I come clean? Shit. Shit.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Well, I don’t know. What do you mean? I know what it is. It sounds gross to me,” I shot back both indignantly and cautiously.</p>\n<p>At this point in time, I had been with the same boyfriend for three years. Yeah, we had been engaging in oral sex.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t our first time around the block with the “birds and the bees” talk. My mom had played this card before, and conditions were always the same: Coerce me into running errands with her, wait until the car is moving and doors are locked and casually bring up the least casual discourse a mother and a teenager can engage in. Every time I was overcome with nausea and carefully assessed my options — open the car door and throw myself into oncoming traffic, and/or simply break into a fit of guilty tears. I have to admit, it’s a brilliant tactic — the in-car sex talk.</p>\n<p>“Well, do you have any friends who do that sort of thing?” she pressed.</p>\n<p>“I mean, I’ve heard of people doing it. I don’t know anyone really well, though. Mostly the more loose girls. None of my friends.”</p>\n<p>Using terms she’s comfortable with was a strategy I had developed over the years. “Loose” to describe “slutty,” “rubbers” to describe “condoms,” “intimacy” to describe “boning.” It was important to make her feel comfortable and convinced so the conversation would end as quickly and painlessly as possible.</p>\n<p>“Good, because I’ve heard that kids these days are shockingly nonchalant about oral sex. You know, that’s something extremely intimate — like post-marriage. I mean, my generation really never even considered that as something to do except with someone you’re extremely comfortable with, like your husband.”</p>\n<p>Oh, Jesus-fucking-Christ. She’s talking about Dad.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fast-forward a year. My high school boyfriend and I broke up after his departure to college, and my friends and I were asked to junior prom by the boys in the grade below us. At this point, I had thoughtfully considered my mother and Oprah’s concerns, and decide to just skip the oral sex.</p>\n<p>The dance had ceased and the after-party had commenced. Before I knew it, Ryan* and I were in someone’s brother’s bed. I knew Ryan in the same way I know a lot of people in my hometown — our brothers grew up playing on the same sports team, and at some point in time we began to acknowledge our friendship, or at least acquaintanceship. Well, this night we got to know each other much better.</p>\n<p>Having only ever slept with one other person, I was surprised by how agilely he navigated my body. He molded me into position after position with the ease of a porn star. Earlier that night, his fancily gelled hair and awkwardly large tux subconsciously told me he meant business, but I couldn’t help but be surprised and impressed with his bedroom cool.</p>\n<p>Immediately after, as he hovered above me in push-up position, he reached toward his hipbone and feigned retrieval of something from his pocket. Granted, he was naked — there was no pocket. He proceeded to pull an imaginary card from his “pocket” and handed it to me.</p>\n<p>“What is this?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“My V-card. It’s all yours.”</p>\n<p>Blindsided again. Should have just stuck with a BJ.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In hindsight, I realize how out of touch I was with my body and sexuality in high school. To be honest, I often still feel mystified by the incredible variance in sexual comfort levels, and often struggle to define my own comfort threshold. I have friends who have slept with triple the amount of people I have and other friends who are still virgins. For some reason the common denominator is that we’re all constantly quantifying our sexual experiences.</p>\n<p>I myself have what I can only describe as a number fixation. Every so often I catch myself treating my sex life like a diet, and half-jokingly declaring, “I’m watching my numbers.” I’m also slightly notorious for demanding to know any new partner’s number well before the conversation is anywhere near appropriate.</p>\n<p>Although difficult to completely define, I believe the pressure I feel to keep my number low is a product of both internal and external factors. I will never claim to be immune to the virgin-whore dichotomy so often projected onto women. Somewhere along the way, media, cultural tradition, family and religious standards have told me I am worth less as a woman if I am “damaged goods.” I’m reluctant to admit acquiescence to negative misogynistic constructs, but I think it’s important to acknowledge the effect they’ve had on my self-evaluation.</p>\n<p>However, I’ll hand it to you, Mom. Sex is intimacy. Time spent having sex with a person belongs to only you two. Never are you more vulnerable than those moments in the bedroom. In my opinion, it’s important to acknowledge that sex is complicated and personal. Reflection on your own definition of sexuality is time well spent. Ignore Oprah, carry the V-card in your wallet with pride and own your number — be it zero, one or 100.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42472\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42472\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/","id":3509,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3508,3507,3506],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"What Do You Want in Bed?: She said","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"1.

Don’t ruin the mood by giving us a play-by-play of what’s going on either — we’re getting a firsthand experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9. We want you to tease us.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to play a little hard-to-get. We want to get to the point where we have to have you. We want to get as close to the edge as we can and then have to start again from somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10. We want you to have sex with us. Right. Now.</strong></p>\n<p>Hey, now, don’t tease us too much. At some point we want you to cut the bullshit and make it happen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yeah, okay, I contradicted myself a couple times. It’s not that we don’t know what we want, we just kind of, well … want it all. It depends on the day, I guess. Is that too much to ask?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>To see the “He Said” portion of this feature, <a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42469\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42469\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/","id":3508,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3507,3506,3505],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"What Do You Want in Bed?: He said","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"1.

There’s something about nature that really gets my blood flowing.</strong></p>\n<p>Whether it’s the fresh air and blue skies or the thrill of being caught pants-down in public, getting buck-wild in the great outdoors is guaranteed to bring out your inner animal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Usher isn’t the only one who wants a lady in the street but a freak in the bed.</strong></p>\n<p>Pain and pleasure are two sides of the same coin, so get loud, get dirty and don’t hesitate to rough us up a bit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. Toys aren’t just for kids — especially the ones you can find in your local sex shop.</strong></p>\n<p>From anal beads to vibrator sleeves, these XXX Toys “R” Us are bound (and gagged) to have something for everyone. Bring your man along and peruse the adult store’s various cuffs, lubes, stimulators, rings and molds together to stimulate each others’ minds and bodies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. I can guarantee nothing will make a guy’s jaw hit the floor faster than your ability to contort into a human pretzel.</strong></p>\n<p>A little flexibility goes a long way and opens the door to a world of crazy sex positions to hit your G-spot from every angle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6. Half the fun of having sex is getting to see each other undress.</strong></p>\n<p>No guy wants to see you in what looks like your grandmother’s hand-me-downs, so take the time to visit Victoria’s Secret and pick out some sexy lingerie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7. Your body is a temple, so put in the time and effort to take care of it.</strong></p>\n<p>Exercising and eating healthy are a major part of my life, so it’s important for a woman to feel the same way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8. Vaginas are the unofficial eighth natural wonder of the world.</strong></p>\n<p>There is so much going on down there and until someone creates a universal manual for guys like me, we’re going to need your help figuring out what you like and where you like it. Spend some time getting to know your body. If you don’t know what makes you tick, how can we?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9. Make your time with him special.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not saying you have to pretend like your drunken encounter at some party Friday night on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive is anything more than a one night stand, but I’m likely to lose interest if I think you’re just as content winding up in my bed as any other guy’s room in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10. Nothing’s more of a turn on than when, in the middle of foreplay, a woman stops and whispers in your ear, “I’m going to fuck you so good.”</strong></p>\n<p>However, it really ruins the effect when it turns out they know less about the art of sex than my 11-year-old brother. Be honest with your partner: If you don’t know your way around his joystick, let him know.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42466\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42466\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/","id":3507,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3506,3505,3504],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Top 10 Misconceptions About Sex","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What we think and what’s true, based on information from UCSB professor John Baldwin, sexuality specialist, and http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo, the website created by Baldwin and his wife as a comp...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>What we think and what’s true, based on information from UCSB professor John Baldwin, sexuality specialist, and http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo, the website created by Baldwin and his wife as a comprehensive source of sex education.</em></p>\n<p><strong>1.

There is a high risk of pregnancy, since a man may unknowingly release sperm inside the vagina before his orgasm. Sperm can also find their way into the vagina from outside the opening if the male is slow to pull out and starts to ejaculate before he has completely removed his penis from the vaginal area. However, recent studies show that this actually works better than perceived. If you absolutely NEED to have sex, it’s better than nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Women want multiple orgasms</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of women just want ONE orgasm. Multiple orgasms don’t usually occur in the 20-24 age group. It takes time to understand a woman’s body and what it wants on both partners’ account.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Gay guys only have anal sex</strong></p>\n<p>Actually, the most common type of sex homosexual males have is oral. But as for anal sex, they are considerably more cautious about the dangers of the behavior than heterosexuals: They are more likely to use condoms for STD protection, whereas heterosexuals generally only think of condoms as birth control for penile-vaginal sex.</p>\n<p><strong>5. I should hide my “bad” body parts</strong></p>\n<p>That should be the last thing you worry about. It’s a shame to handicap yourself by refusing to go on top because you think your stomach bulges. This country places so much emphasis on body image, but personality should be more important than looks. The hottest person in the party might be your ideal, but if they open their mouth and they’re an idiot or a jerk, why would you want to sleep with them anyway? You should ENJOY the experience, not just look good doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>6. The Morning After Pill is the only contraceptive I need</strong></p>\n<p>Emergency contraceptives are not nearly as good as using birth control all the time. That being said, it is a good thing to have in your medicine chest — it takes anxiety, stress and fear out of your mind. What if you get into a situation where you do need an emergency contraceptive? Condom breaks? Miss a pill? It is a good thing to turn to right away. The FDA recently approved a new emergency contraceptive: ella. It has full effectiveness over the course of five days (in which sperm inhabit women’s bodies) but is only available by prescription. Visit ella-kwikmed.com for an online medical consultation and prescription.</p>\n<p><strong>7. I can’t get pregnant if I have sex on my period</strong></p>\n<p>It IS possible to get pregnant while on your period. You are most likely to become pregnant during ovulation, which generally occurs 14 days after the start of your last period — but this time is variable. Sperm can live in a woman’s body for five days; if it is still present during ovulation, you CAN get pregnant.</p>\n<p><strong>8. My sexual fantasies reflect my sexual orientation</strong></p>\n<p>Homosexuals have heterosexual fantasies and heterosexuals have homosexual fantasies. Don’t take these too seriously; they don’t reveal anything about your sexual orientation. Likewise, these fantasies aren’t usually the most common — your dreams and fantasies are based on crazy associations and random thoughts — they bounce all over the place.</p>\n<p><strong>9. The tighter the condom, the better</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to condoms, knowledge and skill are more important than anything else. You should always properly put on a condom and take precautions to hold onto it while pulling it out. Females, you should learn how to put it on him in a way that excites him — he won’t be able to say no. If he’s not going to do it the way you want, you can always say no.</p>\n<p><strong>10. I can learn everything about sex from porn</strong></p>\n<p>Soc152A is made up of 2/3 women and 1/3 men. Some guys think they don’t need to know anything other than what they’ve seen in porn. However, it offers an unrealistic presentation of sex. Girls can actually tell when a guy has only learned from porn … and it’s usually not a good thing. There is actually a large repertoire of skills men can acquire that would significantly increase sexual pleasure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Amanda Hill is the</em> Daily Nexus <em>Managing Editor</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/","id":3505,"author":{"id":332,"name":"Amanda Hill"},"related":[3504,3503,3502],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Is it UCSB or UCSTD?","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As a Gaucho, you’re probably aware of UCSB’s notorious reputation, namely that of a high STI rate among the general student population.

Alongside “U Can Study Buzzed,” we’re boasting the nicknames “University of Casual Sex and Beer” and “UCSTD.” As soon as I got accepted, the rumors of one in four STI-infected students plagued me.</p>\n<p>However, according to Malek Guerbaoui, Sex and Relationships liaison at the office of Student Health, the rates for UCSB “are right on par with the national average … going to UCSB results in no higher likelihood of contracting an STI.”</p>\n<p>While waiting in the office of Student Health for an STI test, a few unnerving thoughts come to mind. The first one comes from a story my friend told me about an archaic method of STI testing that involves the insertion of an umbrella-like object into unmentionable parts, only for it to be to pried open and scraped to collect God knows what. The second thought: “What if I actually have something?” I mean, I haven’t had the most active year, mind you, but these test results could change my life in grave and unpredictable ways. I guess HPV wouldn’t be so bad for me, and I know chlamydia can be taken care of easily, but the big ones? I shudder to think…</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The wait is short and Phlebotomist Nicky Guzmán draws two vials of blood quickly and painlessly. UCSB provides walk-in service for STI testing of HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea: blood is drawn for HIV and syphilis for free if you have USHIP insurance, and there is a $20 fee per urine test for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Urine testing is most effective if one hasn’t urinated for over an hour before the test. The entire test, including registering and waiting, took approximately 20 minutes, though I only had blood drawn.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Student Health center also readily offers other types of tests for STIs, though they require meeting with a physician. HPV, herpes and molluscum contagiosum (warts caused by a poxvirus after direct contact with an affected area) can be treated after a visual exam with a physician. For ladies, vaginal infections such as yeast infections require pelvic exams. Appointments for all of these exams can be made via the UCSB Student Health website.</p>\n<p>Having gone through the process of STI testing, I can tell you that it was easy and well worth it. It is better to know about these things sooner than later, and Guerbaoui suggests that, even if you don’t show any symptoms, an STI test may be worth your while: “the number one symptom of STIs is not having symptoms.”</p>\n<p>Getting regular STI tests is the mature and responsible thing to do, not only for your own health, but also for the health of people with whom you engage in sexual relations. You put them at risk if you put off STI testing.</p>\n<p>The Student Health STI information packet makes one message incredibly clear. Bolded, underlined and italicized: “Condom use can minimize your chances of contracting all of the above infections.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42457\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42457\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/","id":3503,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3502,3501,3500],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Well this is awkward…","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Among a few other, more profound lessons, my time in college has taught me an inevitable fact about hookups: The phrase “It couldn’t get more awkward than this” is always false, and continues to...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Among a few other, more profound lessons, my time in college has taught me an inevitable fact about hookups: The phrase “It couldn’t get more awkward than this” is always false, and continues to be proven every weekend.

You can be a firecracker in the sheets, a sensual god(dess), a carnal connoisseur or, to put it bluntly, just damn good at sex — but that by no means prepares you for the dreaded small talk as you’re both waking up and becoming intensely aware of just how naked you are.</p>\n<p>Although charming moments like these may spur the desire to vow abstinence and get thee to a nunnery — I guess Shakespeare understood? — it’s easier to just laugh it off and accept that, in a decade or three, you’ll probably stop blushing, and he or she won’t remember that your exiting phrase was “later, skater.”</p>\n<p>After three years of this shit, I’ve pretty much concluded that I gravitate toward all things awkward. In fact, I may be a bit of a masochist if the definition includes the desire to humiliate oneself to an unreasonable extent in front of as many people as possible, in the strangest way imaginable.</p>\n<p>My junior year, I fell off a bunk bed mid-hookup, cascading off a dresser and landing on a side table, waking up his alarmed roommate, who was probably wondering why some spastic girl was going on a rampage around their room.</p>\n<p>Another time I was dancing at a party and things were getting sweaty (since I’m not one of those inhuman girls who won’t even gently perspire at the gym). Everything was going smoothly until I felt one half of my adhesive bra slide off and, not knowing what to do, ripped of the entire thing and shoved it in my pocket. This almost went unnoticed, until I looked down and saw that the left boob had fallen on the ground and attached to the shoe of the guy I was dancing with. It’s all a bit of a blur now, but in the next few moments my instincts took over and I ended up rushing off before we had to discuss why I’d just torn a boob off his foot.</p>\n<p>But my finest hour by far was one afternoo­n when I was coming out of the morning’s thick delirium that causes me to take on one of many wildly inappropriate, hungover alter-egos. Afternoon goodbyes are much more risky than morning ones because the night’s intoxicants have almost worn off entirely and you’re likely to run into 20 or so acquaintances on your way home. At the very least, I expected the stretch from the bedroom to the front door to be painless, until I emerged into the living room, looking like I’d just returned from the war, only to be greeted by a standing ovation of five to 10 guys. The welcoming parade didn’t end at the door though — they followed me outside, chanting my name and fist-pumping as I sprint-walked down the street, entertaining Bagel Café diners and a house full of laughing college boys, sending me off the classy way.</p>\n<p>So we all rack up a few gems after years of navigating the I.V. hookup culture. I’m here to tell you to just relax, and possibly even relish in the fact that you have some funny ones under your belt.
