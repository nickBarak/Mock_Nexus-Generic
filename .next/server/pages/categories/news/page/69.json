Tenants brought their issues with renting in I.V. to the I.V. Tenants Union’s town hall. Will Tran / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Daniel Renteria, chair of the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU) and a fourth-year political science and communications double major, led the town hall in the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic building. The majority of the students present were Associated Students (A.S.) senators who spoke of their own issues with I.V. landlords.</p>\n<p>Several tenants expressed frustration about communicating with their landlords, citing incidents where their landlords had not responded to repeated emails or texts.</p>\n<p>Ron Perry, A.S. Legal Resource Center Staff Attorney, said that physical correspondence like “snail mail” is still the best way to communicate with landlords in the event of an issue, because some judges “still have a hard time with electronic communication” in court.</p>\n<p>He added that students should “always document” any communication that happens between themselves and their landlords.</p>\n<p>Anthony Pimentel, an A.S. off-campus senator and third-year political science major, said he has had disputes with his landlord in the past over getting his full security deposit back.</p>\n<p>“We’re only expecting a few hundred at worst to be deducted from our security deposit for average wear and tears,” he said.</p>\n<p>Pimentel said he was charged “outrageous prices” for carpet replacement, as well as for appliances and paint jobs throughout the house that had already been worn down before they moved in. He said he photographed these before moving in.</p>\n<p>Perry encouraged students to check landlords’ previous court disputes before signing a housing contract and to take pictures of the condition of the house before moving in like Pimentel had done.</p>\n<p>“We see the same landlords over and over and over again,” Perry said. “There’s a record of that, of course, you can go to the court or go online.”</p>\n<p>Renteria said that issues between tenants and landlords arise when students rent from “a few large corporations and multi-millionaire landlords” that “have overstepped their legal boundaries.”</p>\n<p>Renteria also said that I.V.’s limited housing contributes to poor landlord-tenant relations, claiming that I.V. has a vacancy rate of under half of a percent. A “healthy” housing market has a vacancy rate of five percent, he said.</p>\n<p>Some students in attendance expressed concerns about the lack of carbon monoxide detectors and fire alarms in their apartments, as well as issues with returns on security deposits.</p>\n<p>Landlords are required to have carbon monoxide detectors in apartments and failure to do so is in violation of California law, Perry said.</p>\n<p>“If you convince the judge that your landlord knew about his obligations under the law and just plain didn’t do it, you could get three times your security deposit back,” Perry said.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, a third-year history of public policy major and I.V. Community Services District (CSD) board member, said that landlords are often aware that their tenants are first-time renters and do not know their legal rights before renting in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Many of these [landlords] are large, out of town housing conglomerates who provide little-to-no customer service to their tenants,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD began discussions for the creation of a landlord-tenant mediation program last Tuesday but have yet to make a final decision.</p>\n<p>Renteria also condemned the actions of Del Playa Rentals owner James Gelb, who yelled homophobic slurs at I.V. CSD president Ethan Bertrand on Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Tenants Union strongly believes that not a single person should endure abuses in any form or shape,” Renteria said, reading a statement from IVTU.</p>\n<p>Perry held a question and answer session after the meeting for students who needed specific legal advice and advised students to come to the Legal Resource Center before renting in I.V. so that they are fully aware of their rights as tenants.</p>\n<p>The center is located on the second floor of the Pardall Center in Isla Vista and is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>\n<p>IVTU plans to hold a second town hall during the end of Winter Quarter to further help “reconcile differences” between landlords and tenants, Renteria said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-78802\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The new program would mediate disputes between tenants and landlords in Isla Vista in collaboration with the many organizations that currently provide different aspects of the dispute resolution process, including the Isla Vista Tenants Union, UC Santa Barbara’s Community Housing Office and others in the area.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (CSD) has not yet decided the program’s specifics but board members have called its creation a “top priority.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB3\">Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3)</a>, which paved the way for the I.V. CSD’s creation with its passage in 2015, provided the district the power to create a tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand gave a presentation about similar tenant mediation programs during the CSD’s Tuesday meeting and said I.V. residents have reached out for assistance with tenant-landlord mediation in the past.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents contacted the Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program for help 64 times in the 2014 to 2015 fiscal year. This is the highest usage rate of by an unincorporated area of the county and nearly double the rate of the community with the second highest usage, according to the presentation.</p>\n<p>Tenants reached out to the mediation program mostly for security deposit refunds, lease terminations, habitability and repair issues and rent increase disputes.</p>\n<p>IVTU provides education and advocacy for tenants and some case work for rental housing issues and the UCSB Community Housing Office provides some dispute resolution and mediation.</p>\n<p>The Legal Aid Foundation of Santa Barbara County also provides information about tenants’ rights and responsibilities, but there is yet to be a service that unites all areas of tenant-landlord issues for all residents.</p>\n<p>Bertrand compared mediation programs in the cities of Palo Alto and Santa Barbara to I.V., which he said has a need for a similar program considering the size of the population and its requests for help from tenant organizations.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Tuesday’s discussion was the board of directors’ first time discussing tenant-landlord mediation programs and said he hopes to discuss the program’s creation with other I.V. stakeholders as the board moves forward.</p>\n<p>If the CSD chooses, it can make its mediation program mandatory through an ordinance, though a majority of board members have said they would first like to create a successful voluntary program before mandating mediation for disputes.</p>\n<p>He said some tenant mediation programs passed by local governments have included provisions for mandatory mediation programs but believes public input is necessary before the CSD makes any program mandatory.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to learning more about the community’s desire for a tenant mediation program and ordinance … The purpose of last night’s presentation was to show examples of what other communities have done to bolster tenant protections,” Bertrand said in an email.</p>\n<p>Some board members have come out in favor of a mandatory tenant mediation program but also say the program must acquire funding and become effective before it can ever become mandatory.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board member Bob Geis said the district should fund the program through the user utility tax that the board is working to bring to the voters by next year.</p>\n<p>Board members are still debating the exact percentage of the tax that will go on next year’s ballot. The utility tax fell short of the 66 percent vote it needed last year, with 61.22 percent of the vote, when Measure F asked voters for an 8 percent tax on Nov. 8, 2016.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD board member and secretary, said a mediation program could create a difference in the way that landlords treat tenants.</p>\n<p>“Customer service to their tenants is not something that is prioritized or even needed because our rental housing market is just so — there’s no choice … There’s no places you can go if you don’t like your landlord,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He said a mandatory program similar to the city of Palo Alto’s could make landlords more responsive when it comes to repairs, security deposit issues and resolving other disputes.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 30 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79934\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79934\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/csd-discusses-mediation-program-between-tenants-and-landlords/","id":4352,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4351,4350,4349],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In Photos: Students Protest Against GOP Tax Bill","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/walkout-by-Nicole-Wallace-8.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/walkout-by-Nicole-Wallace-8.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Under the tax bill, graduate students that receive tuition waivers would have to pay income taxes because those waivers would be counted as income.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The project to repair El Centro began in January after the university notified students that the building was no longer safe due to dry rot, insect damage, steel beam corrosion and an inadequate amount of ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor.</p>\n<p>The project cost approximately $900,000, according to UC Santa Barbara spokesperson Andrea Estrada. Student Affairs contributed $100,000, and the university allocated the remaining $800,000 through the deferred maintenance program.</p>\n<p>University officials originally told students to evacuate El Centro within 45 days, saying the building would either be demolished or improved within that time period. The alarming notice provoked outcry from student groups that use the historical space.</p>\n<p>The university intended to complete the project over the summer, but plumbing complications and changes with university officials overseeing the project slowed the project’s process, said Lorena Alvarez, a fourth-year English major and member of the El Centro Committee.</p>\n<p>“I guess they didn’t realize how many structural issues the building had,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>El Centro serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>The building is located in two combined industrial trailers and was initially designed to last 10 years, according to campus architects. The building has long outlasted its lifespan, and cultural groups that have occupied the space since the 1970s demand a permanent foundation for its walls.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the building repairs were slow at the start of the summer due to plumbing complications and when a project manager went on vacation, but progress sped up when Alvarez returned to UCSB in August.</p>\n<p>“Over the summer, you would have seen nothing being done to El Centro, and when I came back in August, you started seeing weekly changes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Former campus architect Marc Fisher, who was one of the lead contributors to the project, left UCSB over the summer to take a job at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the El Centro Committee worked with Fisher until he left and has since communicated with Renee Bahl, associate vice chancellor for Design, Facilities and Safety Services, about the repairs.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee was designed to monitor the building repairs and keep an open line of communication between students and administrators. The group meets weekly to discuss the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t architects,” Alvarez said. “We want to make sure we understand what’s happening as students.”</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began in February, the university added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building.</p>\n<p>These structures made the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes, campus architect Ed Schmittgen told the <em>Nexus</em> in April, and the university opted to repair the building instead of demolish it.</p>\n<p>Some student organizations have been able to use various parts of the building throughout the reconstruction.</p>\n<p>In October, El Congreso was permitted to use the second floor of the building once again, after being unable to use it for the first few weeks of Fall Quarter, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Two rooms were also available for students to use as study spaces, and two full time Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) counselors and cultural mentors began using the space to hold office hours.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee also received $9,000 from the Associated Students Senate in October to purchase a security system for the building.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the system will have card readers and make it easier for students to access the building more frequently, even when other student groups are not holding office hours or using the building.</p>\n<p>“We had an issue with students being not being able to get into El Centro because it was locked,” Alvarez said. “Getting the card reader … would be a safer way for them to navigate through the building and get access to the building.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the university has been transparent about its work on the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m really thankful that they’re allowing us to be a part of these conversations and ask for things when we need clarifications,” Alvarez said. “They’ve been really helpful in that sense.”</p>\n<p><em>A version

left ash and burnt vegetation that could wash into the lake. Heavy rainfall could further pollute the lake because the lack of vegetation has created loose sediment, resulting in a mudslide hazard.</p>\n<p>Lake Cachuma provides water for four districts in Santa Barbara County: the City of Santa Barbara, Goleta Water District, Montecito Water District and Carpinteria Valley Water District, according to Fray Crease, Santa Barbara County water agency manager.</p>\n<p>Increased sediment flow into the lake presents a challenge for water filtration and treatment, Crease said.</p>\n<p>She said water purveyors are planning to use alternate water sources if Lake Cachuma’s water becomes too difficult to treat in the winter.</p>\n<p>According to David Matson, assistant general manager and chief of staff at the Goleta Water District, the District has moved toward groundwater usage for the coming winter. The Goleta Water District’s service areas include Isla Vista and UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The conditions surrounding Lake Cachuma create “significant concern” about the water quality because of the potential for sediment runoff into the lake, Matson said.</p>\n<p>He said risk factors that could affect the water quality include the severity of the wildfire burn, steep terrain, erosion and the proximity of the burn area to the watershed.</p>\n<p>Although the rainy season has not yet begun, Lake Cachuma has already faced several environmental challenges in recent years, Matson said.</p>\n<p>The six-year California drought reduced Lake Cachuma’s water levels to 7 percent capacity at its lowest point. The newly exposed land experienced overgrowth of vegetation, he said.</p>\n<p>“Winter rains in 2017 resulted in the submersion of this vegetation, which is now decaying underwater … leading to deteriorating water quality,” Matson said in an email.</p>\n<p>Lake Cachuma’s water supply has since recovered, rising by 24.5 percent in one week earlier this year, the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/\">reported</a> in February of this year.</p>\n<p>As of Monday, Nov. 27, Lake Cachuma is at 39 percent of its water storage capacity, <a href=\"http://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedFiles/pwd/Content/Water/Documents/rainfallreport.pdf\">according to data from the Santa Barbara County Flood Control District</a>.</p>\n<p>Past fires in the area, including the Rey fire that occurred in the summer of 2016, have also detrimentally affected Lake Cachuma’s water quality. Matson said even the 2007 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2007-09-28/los-padres-area-soon-to-open-after-zaca-blaze/\">Zaca Fire</a> that burned through the Lake Cachuma area has left residual effects

Courtesy of Eli Bahar</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat Yoga is a fitness trend that began in 2016 and has been considered a type of animal therapy. During a goat yoga class, goats interact with participants by jumping on participants’ backs or snuggling on the yoga mat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goat yoga class in I.V. will be held at the Santa Barbara Hillel this upcoming Saturday, Dec. 2, at 11 a.m. A maximum of 50 people are allowed in the class, and the class will cost $40 per participant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eli Bahar, a second-year undeclared major and host of the event, said goat yoga is more beneficial than regular yoga because the interaction with goats releases endorphins, which stimulates a positive feeling in the body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It connects you to the people around you and provides a friendly atmosphere,” Bahar said. “It is more than zen and more of an experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar grew up in Los Angeles and said he discovered goat yoga last August. He was on a waitlist for three months before he could participate because there is only one studio in Los Angeles that offers the unique yoga class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was an amazing experience and a crazy wild adrenaline rush. You are just surrounded by people having a good time,” Bahar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar said he wanted to bring goat yoga to I.V. because UCSB students “stress out and don’t find time for themselves.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar contacted a farm in Sun Valley, Calif. that brings certified goats to yoga events. It is “fairly expensive” to bring this experience to Isla Vista, Bahar said, but he expects a good turnout at the class.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat yoga was created by Lainey Morse, a goat owner from Albany, Oreg.

The new store opened next to HiWi Tropical Fusion on 6555 Pardall Road as part of a franchise partnership between the two stores.</p>\n<p>The juice bar will sell blended smoothies, açaí and pitaya bowls and pressed and raw juices.</p>\n<p>The Friday grand opening included live music, prize giveaways and local vendor product samplings.</p>\n<p>Monica Martinez, president of HiWi Inc. and the new Juice It Up! location, said the company wanted to bring the juice bar to I.V. to offer a healthy food option to the UC Santa Barbara campus and community.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! will not serve beer or wine, Martinez said, because “there’s already enough alcohol in I.V.”</p>\n<p>“We know that it’s really good for profit, but we’re not here just for profit. We’re really here to try to be a sustainable business,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! is one of many raw juice bar companies HiWi Fusion considered partnering with before making their final decision. Other candidates for the juice locale included Jamba Juice and Maui Wowi.</p>\n<p>Martinez said she chose to partner with Juice It Up! because of its high quality products.</p>\n<p>“They actually have a full-time food scientist who does hours and hours of testing to make sure that it’s the best and healthiest product out there,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up!’s notability as a brand was also a factor in the final decision, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“People would be more familiar with something that they’re used to,” said Martinez. “There are a lot of students at UCSB that are from Southern California, and Juice It Up! is originally from Southern California.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said she hopes the option to order Juice It Up! online will be helpful for students that do not have time to eat breakfast. Customers can place an order online and pick it up on their way to class, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“Most students do not have time to stop and eat breakfast, so a smoothie or a bowl or a protein shake or raw juice is often a quick breakfast for them,” she said. “They’ll have their drink ready to go and they can have their breakfast on their way to class.”</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! takes online orders through their website <em>hiwifusion.com/menu</em> and offers pick-up and delivery through SBmenus and UberEATS.</p>\n<p>The new store will be open between 7 a.m. and 10:00 p.m Monday through Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“Not enough [people] participate in the resistance against the continuation of the perpetuation of rape culture,” said Ro’Shawndra Earvin, a UCSB student and a lead speaker at May’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">sit-in</a>, as she opened the meeting with a statement expressing her continued frustration.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara administrators led Tuesday’s panel in Harold Frank Hall, speaking on behalf of Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, also presented updates on each of the demands.</p>\n<p>The panel included Katya Armistead, dean of student life; Kim Equinoa, assistant dean of students; Briana Conway, director of Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.); Jeanne Stanford, director of Counseling and Psychological Services; Diane O’Brien, executive assistant to Yang<strong>; </strong>and Cathy Farley, assistant chief for the UC Police Department.</p>\n<p>Earvin expressed her frustration at the university’s handling of the demands, saying Armistead failed to solicit students to join committees to comply with the demands through a university announcement.</p>\n<p>“Ro Earvin, in unity with the A.N.W.O branch of UCSB and the Student Activist Network are looking for students interested in working on committees created for the demands signed May 4th 2017 in response to the University’s response to Sexual Assault. And for more information to contact me at <em>r.smivsb@gmail.com</em> with the demand(s) interested in working on and a schedule,” Earvin said in her email to UC administration.</p>\n<p>Armistead said she misunderstood Earvin’s request and sent out an email advertising Tuesday’s town hall to all students.</p>\n<p>Following Earvin’s opening statement, attendees received updates on each of the 12 demands made by nowUCsb, an organization which strives to “expose and reform broken campus policies on sexual violence” according to the group’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>The administration marked each demand as “incomplete,” “complete” or “in progress.” The panel then provided specific information on the progress of each demand.</p>\n<p>The first demand was to create and fund a survivor resource center in Isla Vista. According to Klawunn, the university provides legal and counseling services for survivors, despite there being no “one-stop shop” for these resources. The demand was marked as incomplete, but the panel said it was interested in looking further into the matter.</p>\n<p>The second demand, which said C.A.P.S. must provide adequate and timely mental health services to survivors and their families, was marked as in progress.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. Director Conway said the organization now has eight staff members, which she described as its largest staff ever. She said C.A.P.S. has also diversified the days and times for group counseling and activities.</p>\n<p>The third demand sought mandatory sensitivity trainings for UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol that address race, gender, class and sexuality in connection to sexual assault and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>Assistant UCPD Chief Farley said UCPD and the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office attended a three-day training this August. Additionally, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/detective-joins-ivfp-following-student-protests-demands/\">IVFP hired a new detective</a>, Julio Gutierrez, to handle sexual assault and interpersonal violence in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said demand four, asking Santa Barbara City College to be more transparent about students who have been disciplined for Title IX violations, is complete.</p>\n<p>UCSB Title IX director Ariana Alvarez will be collaborating with the Title IX director at SBCC.</p>\n<p>The seventh demand, for survivors of sexual assault and interpersonal violence to be able to transfer to a different university, is already in practice, Klawunn said. The UC facilitates UC-to-UC transfers for survivors.</p>\n<p>Demand 10, which required integrating Queer Connect, an educational workshop that focuses on sexual assault, dating violence and stalking within LGBTQ communities, to reporting and trainings, was also implemented and officially began at the beginning of Fall Quarter, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>The remaining seven demands were marked incomplete, but members of the panel assured those in attendance they are working to meet them.</p>\n<p>Demand six ordered administration to work with the I.V. CSD to create a report card for government institutions and law enforcement agencies for behaviors and education surrounding rape and sexual assault in I.V. Earvin marked that demand six has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p>The university is unable to meet demand eight for increased lighting on Slough Road because the Coastal Commission will not approve the change in infrastructure, according to Klawunn.</p>\n<p>Demand nine, to organize a meeting with all UC Chancellors on our UC Santa Barbara campus to develop system-wide level change, was not met “the way the demand is written,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>A UC-level sexual assault policy training review was held in September.</p>\n<p>Demand 11 asked the UC president to conduct yearly campus tours, where they should hold a public sexual violence town hall at every UC campus once per year.</p>\n<p>Robin Holmes-Sullivan, UC vice president for student affairs, will instead hold a town hall at UCSB on Jan. 8.</p>\n<p>Demand 12 requested Chancellor Yang and his office regularly update students about the progress being made on these demands. Klawunn said the demand was incomplete and said Tuesday’s town hall was one way to update the public.</p>\n<p>After the panel discussed their progress on each of the 12 demands, the floor became open for the approximately 30 students present to ask questions. The panel also answered anonymously submitted questions.</p>\n<p>Attendees asked why the UC administration has the funds for <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/\">Halloween ads</a> but not to meet the 12 demands. Others asked whether programs like Gaucho FYI and Haven are enough to combat rape culture.</p>\n<p>The public made suggestions to the panel regarding addressing rape culture at places like the Student Leadership Retreat, where many leaders of organizations gather for training each year.</p>\n<p>They also mentioned the newly-introduced UC Title IX Student Advisory Board and asked if the students chosen to serve on this board would be compensated for the time commitment required to be on the board.</p>\n<p>Armistead agreed that students who serve on the board should be compensated.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Senators Kian Maalizadeh and Steven Ho co-authored the resolution to condemn Gelb’s comments. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>In the resolution, the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate recommended the I.V. Tenants’ Union (IVTU) hold a town hall meeting with tenants and property owners to discuss relations between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>The IVTU plans to host a town hall meeting next Tuesday, Nov. 21, at 6 p.m. at the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, according to fourth-year Daniel Renteria, IVTU chair and one of the resolution’s student sponsors.</p>\n<p>“Nobody should have to deal with this abusive behavior,” Renteria said at the Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>“We support tenants rights to speak and organize against unjust housing conditions,” the resolution reads. “Housing is monopolized by a few large investment corporations and multimillionaire landlords who overstepped their legal boundaries.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County tax rolls from 2015, Gelb had a property value of $39.3 million. The <i>Santa Barbara Independent’s </i><a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2015/jun/11/isla-vista-investors-paradise/\">analysis</a> of the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District bedroom tax ranked him as the fifth wealthiest property owner in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>There are multiple videos and texts revealing altercations between Gelb and other Isla Vista tenants published online that are the “most troubling” to the Senate, the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>Maalizadeh, a transfer senator and fourth-year biology major, said at the Senate meeting that he hopes the Tenants’ Union’s town hall can provide tenants and landlords a place to discuss their concerns and work to reach resolutions.</p>\n<p>“This meeting is in light of Gelb’s comments, but can include other interactions similar to this from other landlords,” Maalizadeh said.</p>\n<p>Gelb was filmed yelling profanities and homophobic slurs at Bertrand at approximately 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 7. A friend of Bertrand’s filmed the incident.</p>\n<p>In the video, Bertrand confronted Gelb about the landlord’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/isla-vista-landlord-leaving-del-playa-drive-after-23-years-lists-properties-for-80-mil/\">decision to sell</a> all of his 37 properties in I.V. and said he did not treat his tenants well.</p>\n<p>Gelb became upset and began to follow Bertrand down the 500 block of State Street, shouting homophobic slurs at Bertrand, who is openly gay.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/isla-vista-landlord-charged-with-criminal-complaint-after-yelling-homophobic-slurs-at-csd-president/\">announced Tuesday she would file disturbing the peace charges against Gelb.</a></p>\n<p>Renteria told the <i>Nexus</i> Wednesday that the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/records-show-years-of-resident-complaints-against-i-v-landlord/\">Tenants’ Union has received complaints from tenants about Gelb and Del Playa Rentals</a>.</p>\n<p>He said if landlords or property owners harass or intimidate their tenants, he would advise them to “not engage” with their landlord’s actions.</p>\n<p>IVTU created an educational campaign for Del Playa Rentals tenants after multiple complaints about Gelb and alleged violations of tenants rights came to their attention, according to the resolution.</p><div

after which they will begin their one-year fellowship in Jan. 2018.</p>\n<p>A press release by the UC Office of the President said the fellowship program is the core of the UC’s recently announced National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>The center aims to explore the issue of free speech on college campuses and American society as a whole.</p>\n<p>Claire Doan, director of media relations for the UC Office of the President, said the center is open to applications from everyone, but that they are specifically looking for established individuals in their respective fields.</p>\n<p>These include policy thinkers, legal scholars, social scientists and journalists who will be expected to use the opportunity to shape the national debate over free speech.</p>\n<p>The application, which is due on Dec. 11, requires a resume, a personal statement of 500 words or fewer and an outline of a research or project proposal, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>As part of their fellowship, fellows will engage with UC students at its Washington Program and spend one week in residence at one of the UC’s 10 campuses, according to the press
