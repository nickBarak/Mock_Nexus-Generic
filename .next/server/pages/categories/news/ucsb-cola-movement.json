On Friday, COLA organizers UC-wide held a one-day general strike for International Workers’ Day against unsafe working conditions brought on by the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers also wrote that the movement continues in a variety of formats online, and that it will continue in person once campuses are re-opened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the pandemic passes and our campus reopens (and both these events </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> occur), we do not intend to return to business as usual,” the email read.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/02/2020, 10:05 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that UAW would not vote to strike until they reach 5,000 signatures on their strike pledge.

After multiple attempts, UCSC was not immediately available for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students launched the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) movement in the fall, asking for a proposed monthly stipend of $1,412 to supplement teaching assistants’ (TA) salaries in the face of rising housing prices. Although the movement comes after years of organizing around the issue, UCSC graduate students officially went on a wildcat strike, meaning action without union support, on Dec. 9, 2019. Until now, they have refused to upload grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC Graduate Student Association President </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yulia Gilichinskaya criticized UCSC’s decision to change all missing grades to pass grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The administration has shifted the burden of missing grades from themselves and onto the undergraduates it purports to care for and educate. We cannot allow this,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that some of the students work really hard and really care about getting an A or getting a B. And so taking that away from students who have those grades when we have them, I think is unfair,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In exchange for submitting withheld grades, some graduate students who were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dismissed from TA positions for spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be “considered for future appointments,” but Gilichinskaya said there are no guarantees of reinstatement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gilichinskaya</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over 80 UCSC graduate students withheld grades during Fall Quarter 2019, which jumped to over 100 withholders by the end of Winter Quarter 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, around 80 UCSC graduate students who were dismissed from their spring TA positions are still without work, according to Gilichinskaya.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With UCSC graduate students now submitting grades before May 1, striking UCSB graduate students are the only grade withholders left in the UC system.

Subsequently, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, including failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union while instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to the current wildcat COLA strikes, potential backing from UAW in a strike against ULP charges would guarantee protections for striking graduate students, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These protections are necessary certainties in these uncertain times. They will allow us to strike against the university with the full weight of our statewide union behind us,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UAW-sanctioned strike would also shift the burden of withholding grades away from two campuses — UCSC and UCSB — toward a UC-wide approach at the union level by creating a system-wide strike, according to Gilichinskaya.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of obtaining signatures to allow a vote to decide on whether to strike over the ULP grievances. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TAs across the UC system are phone banking to help collect more signatures for the vote and , as of Monday, have obtained</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over 2,300 of the 5,000 in-unit signatures needed, according to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya’s email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya said that grade withholding in future quarters will continue if a ULP strike is to occur, but until then, graduate students are losing their “biggest leverage” in the COLA strikes against UCOP to demand a living wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grades are what the university cares about. It doesn’t care about the quality of the education. It needs the grades for the bureaucracy to smoothly function,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Gilichinskaya said that due to the coronavirus pandemic — and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">switch to remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that came with it — the COLA movement lost vital momentum that came from in-person picket lines. But she foresees “statewide massive withholding of teaching and grading labor” in the event of a union-sanctioned ULP strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people lost their second and third jobs. A lot of people weren’t as confident that they could risk their employment and their health insurance in the midst of a pandemic,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this leverage sort of didn’t have as much strength just because we didn’t have the numbers at the end of winter quarter.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

However, personnel managers were adamant that students follow dining hall protocol and not remove food from Ortega, leading to a brief confrontation with activists and students leaving with to-go plates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as lines for food got longer and began to stretch around the building, organizers continued to encourage students to take food to go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to occupy Ortega was made to show how the UC “functions as a business rather than a school,” according to the COLA press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By liberating this dining commons, we draw attention to how food insecurity functions daily on our campus, keeping us from being the students, teachers, and mentors we want to be. While graduate students are currently on a wildcat strike, this action demonstrates that our movement is not only dedicated to achieving fair pay but also to changing the priorities of the public university system to better fit the needs of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> students,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the statement continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most students who entered the building seemed to support the graduate students’ actions. One student, Kayla Katsuda, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, noted that she came for the free lunch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends told me about what was going on, and I came because I don’t have a meal plan,” Katsuda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One UCSB student and Ortega Dining Commons employee explained to the Nexus that he “didn’t know what was going on” at first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They seemed to be letting all people in, and the food is overpriced, so I would agree with that.

Thursday’s action marked one </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">full week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since UCSB graduate students began striking. COLA organizers across the UC system called for the one-day strike, asking professors to halt lectures, students to walk out of class and for participants to wear black, hence the name “black-out” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The motto of the UC system is “let there be light,” one speaker said at the Storke Tower noon rally. “When we wear black, it shows the UC administration that without graduate student labor, there is no light.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC-wide work stoppage started early morning on Thursday; at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, protesters blocked all four entrances to Cheadle Hall — UCSB’s administrative building — and stood shoulder-to-shoulder at each entrance. At the front entrance, organizers held a sign that read, “FUCK THE UC! AND A BITCH NAMED JANET.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some administrators who work in Cheadle Hall argued with strikers and attempted to force their way through but were pushed back, sending administrators and staffers circling around the building in hopes of finding another way in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, you guys, I don’t fucking support you. We have to work too,” one employee said to COLA organizers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers continued to refuse to allow administrators to enter into the building, including Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the UC Police Department and administration spoke with protesters, saying they had to move or risk being arrested, organizers regrouped and decided to move inside instead, occupying every floor of the building and chanting, “Don’t cross the picket, don’t be a scab,” to employees as they entered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One undergraduate advisor left his office to explain to strikers that “the students that we see are just as stressed as you are.” After organizers began arguing and chanting — drowning out the advisor</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Ry Brennan, one of COLA’s de-escalators, came to help defuse the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brennan and the advisor reached a compromise, in which strikers would be alerted to stay quiet should any undergraduates come into the building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After occupying Cheadle Hall for most of the morning, organizers started to gear up for the noon rally. At approximately 11:30 a.m., students and faculty holding “Faculty for COLA” and “You’re gonna have to fire us too, Janet,” banners marched from Cheadle Hall to Storke Tower and met with demonstrators who had been there since 8 a.m. as part of their regularly scheduled strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Storke Tower, UC worker unions and academic associations expressed their solidarity with and support of UCSB’s COLA movement to an animated crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers representing different unions emphasized a message of solidarity between various unions, all fighting for better treatment from the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a UCSB groundskeeper and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME) Local 3299 member, noted the similarities between the COLA movement and the labor strikes throughout the country, including AFSCME 3299’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">labor fight over the past few years. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every person in this country deserves that security, and that’s why we won’t stop fighting until we have a job that’s worth having and a way to pay rent. You have our support as workers, and I know not a lot of people [from AFSCME] made it out here today because they’re very busy, but I’ve been talking to them at work and you absolutely have our support,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Colvin, Christopher John Newfield, a professor of literature and American studies at UCSB and second vice president of the executive council of the Modern Language Association (MLA) of America, emphasized the MLA’s “unanimous and quite enthusiastic” commitment to support the UC-wide strikers and condemned the termination of UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 1 p.m., the procession of approximately 3,000 marched to Henley Gate, garnering the attention of those on campus as they passed through the Arbor and University Library. Those in “precarious situations,” such as undocumented or international students, were encouraged to walk by organizers wearing red armbands and caution tape, who were designated de-escalators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Henley Gate, the crowd chanted, “Cops off campus, COLA in our bank accounts,” at cars driving by and police officers monitoring the event. Protesters stayed at the gate for nearly 30 minutes before walking back to Storke, where some remained to complete the daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York University sociology professor Andrew Ross visited Santa Barbara to take part in the strike, praising attendees as a catalyst for social change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Graduate student employees are the true conscience of the academic profession, and COLA strikers are the true conscience of the UAW,” Ross said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one deserves to be paid a poverty wage because they love teaching or because they’re training for a job in an academic profession,” he said. “That is not a principle of fair labor, that is a recipe for exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi and Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students are on a “wildcat” strike, meaning that they are striking without the approval of their union and contract. </span><em>Jonathan Sloboda / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2865 filed formal charges against the UC with California Public Employment Relations Board (PERB), alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the complaints, UAW 2865 alleged that the UC attempted to bargain for a COLA with individuals and groups instead of the union. It also alleged that the UC went outside of the collective bargaining agreement with UAW by firing teaching assistants for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every member of the union will soon have the chance to democratically vote on whether or not we can hold a strike. If approved, this action would be statewide, and could affect every department at the University of California,” UAW 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar said in a press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the COLA movement grows across the UC, graduate students have emphasized that their actions are a “wildcat” strike, meaning that they are striking without the approval of their union and contract, which was negotiated by UAW in 2018 and expires in 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/janet-napolitano-ucsc-administration-warn-of-termination-to-striking-ucsc-graduate-students/\">wrote</a> on Feb. 14 to UCSC faculty that the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) would not “re-open the agreement or negotiate a separate side-letter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 24, the UC Regents filed an <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\">Unfair Practice Charge</a> against UAW. Since the UC system is a public institution, all labor disputes go through PERB when one party in a state labor contract alleges another of unfair practice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents allege that UAW “condoned, supported, encouraged, and failed to take affirmative action to end, unlawful concerted activity in violation of the parties’ No Strikes clause,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Unfair Practice Charge will be decided by PERB in a public hearing if the charges are not settled beforehand. A hearing date has not been set, according to UAW statewide Trustee and doctoral history student Andrew Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents are requesting that PERB issue multiple orders of action against UAW: one declaring the work stoppages at UCSC and all other UC campuses an illegal strike, and another order for UAW to refrain from engaging in any strikes, according to the charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents are also requesting that PERB seek an injunction to prevent Academic Student Employees (ASE) — which includes teaching assistants, tutors and readers — and UAW from engaging in strikes and “any other relief the Board deems just and proper,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the two orders both restrict current strikes, if enacted, the injunction would give the UC the authority to forcibly shut down strikes with police at all UC campuses, according to Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the UC Regents’ unfair practice charge, UAW filed two separate Unfair Practice Charges on Feb. 28 and March 2 against the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\">first set</a> of charges allege that the UC refused to negotiate a COLA with UAW, while at the same time bargaining directly with individuals and university-funded student organizations, which don’t have the legal authority to bargain with the UC, according to a UAW press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear that UC wants to create an appearance that it is respecting graduate student employees while avoiding true bargaining, where the law requires the parties to stand with equal footing and to act in good faith,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no current bargaining between graduate students and UCOP, Napolitano published a statement on Feb. 21 saying that she would meet with the UC Graduate and Professional Council (UCGPC) to discuss a variety of issues including “cost of living.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC then published a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/ucgpc-says-it-will-not-meet-with-napolitano-to-discuss-a-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">statement</a> clarifying that the meeting was not in response to COLA, and that the timing and wording of Napolitano’s statement caused a misunderstanding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charges also referenced the offer UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive extended to striking graduate students, which included guaranteed five-year packages for Ph.D. students and two-year packages for M.A. students, along with a $2,500 annual housing supplement for graduate students who submitted fall quarter grades and stopped striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\">second set</a> of Unfair Practice Charges, filed on March 2, allege that the UC violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\">dismissing</a> UCSC TAs from spring quarter appointments for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades; according to the charges, the UC “denies these workers their statutory right to union representation and is intended to bypass the union.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These charges led to the UAW Bargaining Team’s vote on March 3, paving the way for a full UAW vote of whether or not to hold a labor practice strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have been calling for the University to come to the table and negotiate a Cost of Living Adjustment for months now. And it is not true that UC can’t reopen the contract that was ratified in 2018. It’s that they won’t. We ask them every day to open the contract and negotiate a</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COLA4ALL?src=hashtag_click\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> #COLA4ALL</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

UCSC graduate students have been on strike since early February, and UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dismissed </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at least 54 of them from their Spring Quarter 2020 appointments last Friday, sparking outrage across the UC system.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">began their own full strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Thursday; at UC Davis, graduate students </span><a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2020/02/26/uc-davis-graduate-students-in-support-of-cola-to-withhold-winter-quarter-grades-beginning-feb-27/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">began a grading strike on Feb. 27</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, meaning they are withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades. They will continue to strike until their demands are met, according to a statement posted to the movement’s Twitter account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA movements on other campuses are planning a one-day, full work stoppage “blackout” strike on Thursday, March 5, in solidarity with the dismissed UCSC graduate students. At each campus, COLA movements are urging faculty to cancel all classes and undergraduate students to walk out of any classes that professors didn’t cancel. Organizers are also asking participants to wear all black. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an ever growing number of students who are ready to strike and who are prepared to strike,” Zak Fisher, UC Los Angeles’ Graduate Student Association president, told the Nexus. Fisher attributed this sentiment not only to the COLA movement at UCLA but also to the firing of the UCSC graduate students, noting that participation in COLA organizing has “increased exponentially.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA graduate students voted Monday evening to join the Thursday “blackout” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are just fed up … the [UCSC] firings brought a lot of attention from people who weren’t really paying attention before,” he said, adding that hundreds of people have attended  UCLA COLA rallies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher, as GSA president, said he presented the UCLA COLA demands to UCLA Chancellor Gene Block on Feb. 21. But beyond that, he said he hasn’t seen much of a response from the chancellor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why is it that it’s the ‘number one public university,’ in the country, [and] the leader of the university won’t come out and publicly address concerns?” Fisher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to at Davis, UC San Diego organizers are leaning more toward a grading strike rather than a full strike, according to Syed Muhammad Abbas Yousuf, an ethnic studies doctoral student, and Avaneesh Narla, a physics doctoral student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that a recent UCSD COLA movement vote showed that around 200 graduate students were willing to strike in some capacity, although there is a “strong leaning toward holding a grading strike rather than a full strike.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are just fed up.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Week Nine, UCSD graduate students scheduled a number of events aimed at educating undergraduates about the movement and gaining support across campus for the movement; they will be joining the “blackout” strike by holding a walkout around 1:30 p.m. on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley graduate students also voted to join the one-day “blackout” strike, according to Tara Phillips, a UCB COLA organizer. UCB’s strike will last from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Sproul Plaza in the center of campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCB COLA movement also voted Tuesday to create a departmental organizing structure and will begin asking different departments to hold meetings to discuss and vote on strike-readiness, according to a resolution passed by the movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once we’ve reached 10 strike-ready departments, we will call a General Assembly to vote on strike escalation on our campus,” an email sent to supporters of the UCB COLA movement said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Riverside, graduate students plan to join the UC-wide “blackout” strike with a rally at 11:45 a.m., according to the movement’s Twitter account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has also released a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyviszddmLXQBJLzQkF7FesG53qcQWrZ0BetfINuBtmzk78A/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the UCR community, asking students to stand in solidarity with the UCSC strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While graduates at some campuses are taking steps toward a vote to strike, others, such as UC Irvine, haven’t decided to go on a full strike but are still organizing for a COLA in other ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI COLA organizers Nalya Rodriguez, a sociology doctoral student, and Courtney Echols, a criminology law and society doctoral student, said that UCI COLA organizing began on Feb. 20, when over 200 UCI graduate students and supporters rallied in solidarity with the UCSC strikers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, UCI put the administration building Aldrich Hall on lockdown. During the rally, campus police </span><a href=\"https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/02/29/uci-alumna-arrested-by-ucipd-during-cost-of-living-adjustment-rally-for-uc-santa-cruz-graduate-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested UCI alumni </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shikera Chamndany</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after she entered the building while attempting to obtain her transcripts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chamndany, who was reportedly not involved with the COLA movement or participating in the rally, was “handcuffed and tackled,” the New University reported. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The arrest drew backlash both on campus and across the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We firmly believe that this [is] indicative of the anti-Blackness that pervades not just UC Irvine, but the UC system as a whole,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Echols said. She said that the following day, the university put out a campus-wide statement “trying to illustrate that they cared about UCI graduate students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But we know that if they actually cared, they would immediately send these issues of unfair wages and unjust housing costs which disproportionately affect Black and brown students,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCI COLA movement held a sick-out on Monday and Tuesday, during which graduate students called in sick and did not show up to work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The average Irvine graduate student spends 43% of their income on rent, and some students report spending as much as 90% of their income on rent here in Irvine,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with a COLA, UCI graduate students are d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emanding that the officer who arrested Chamndany, Sgt. Tricia Harding, be fired, and that the campus police be abolished. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93334\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/community-gathers-to-celebrate-life-of-isla-vista-advocate-michael-bean/cola_jonathan-sloboda_online_4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-93334\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93334\" data-attachment-id=\"93334\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/community-gathers-to-celebrate-life-of-isla-vista-advocate-michael-bean/cola_jonathan-sloboda_online_4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"COLA_Jonathan Sloboda_ONLINE_4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93334\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93334\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jonathan Sloboda / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Merced UAW 2865 unit chair Anh Diep explained that even though UC Merced is the “cheapest” UC campus in terms of cost of living, students have been supportive of the UCSC graduate student strikers and have begun advocating for administration to address graduate student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people think that Merced would be the campus that doesn’t care … since it’s so new and it’s built in the Central Valley where real estate is cheapest,” Diep said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But we do feel rent burden here, and we have seen this dramatic increase in the last few years. We’re especially cognizant that the time to act is now, the time to be proactive is now, because we have a chance to stop this in our own city and prevent further rent burden and further rent hikes before it gets as dramatically bad as it has gotten in the other campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diep said that UAW 2865 leadership, along with general members, met with UCM Chancellor Nathan Brostrom on March 2 to </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kWBMnJQHG5tgoC2JGAN3kUUHBlaZHxcm-QVkCCLlKXg/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discuss graduate student struggles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and that they plan to meet sometime next week for a follow-up meeting. Diep emphasized that the discussion focused on broader needs and did not focus on the specific TA contract currently in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been no formal UC-wide response to the COLA movements to date; organizers across the UC system emphasized that negotiations need to happen through UCOP instead of at individual universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents filed an Unfair Practices Charge against UAW 2865 on Feb. 24, alleging that the union has failed to take action to end strikes at UCSC. In response, UAW 2865 filed two separate Unfair Practice Charges against the UC; the UAW 2865 bargaining unit also voted on March 3 to hold a union-wide vote whether to go on strike due to unfair labor practices. All union members will vote on this in April. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

But the UCSC COLA movement, which is asking for a COLA of $1,412 per month, denounced UCSC’s offer, both on the picket line and on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the first official reported terminations as a result of the strike, despite weeks of threats from administrators. The original deadline for UCSC graduate students to turn in Fall Quarter 2019 undergraduate grades was last Friday, Feb. 21; UCSC later said it would verify which students submitted their grades yesterday, Feb. 27. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several graduate students who received dismissal letters posted screenshots of them on social media; one graduate student who had their spring quarter teaching assistant position with the feminist studies department terminated, Zia Puig, shared their letter with the Nexus.

While on strike, UCSB graduate students who work as teaching assistants will withhold Winter 2020 grades and will not hold any sections or do any work unrelated to their own degrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large number of graduate students, undergraduates and faculty returned for the second day of the strike, with upwards of 300 showing up for day two of the rally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s graduate students are from the second campus within the UC system to go on strike in the fight for a COLA; UC Santa Cruz graduate students are on their 13th day on the picket line, and UC Davis recently announced that they will be withholding grades starting yesterday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every UC campus — except for UC San Francisco — has taken some form of organizing action for a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike at UCSB began at 8 a.m. and continued until 5 p.m., with a rally at noon where close to 1,600 people filled the Storke Tower lawn. The crowd heard from various organizers, faculty and undergraduates before marching across bike lanes, through the Arbor and to the Mosher Alumni House parking lot. On the way back to Storke Tower, a crowd formed a circle around the University Library, continuing to chant while other speakers spoke.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane Fujino, a professor and interim chair in the department of Asian American studies, said to the crowd at the rally that the university needs to be more seriously addressing COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the Thomas Fires hit, this university took extraordinary measures — finals were moved to another quarter. This, I say, is an extraordinary moment. Graduate students on average spend over 50% of their income on rent. This is untenable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate Student Association (GSA) President Cierra Sorin said that the high turnout for the first day of the strike was unexpected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not gonna lie, I was scared getting up this morning. I didn’t sleep a whole lot last night; this is a big thing that we’re doing. But people came through,” Sorin said. “Every constituency on campus, I think, came through today, especially the undergrads — there were hundreds of undergrads that came out. I’m in awe.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday morning began with approximately 20 people, but by 11 a.m., that number grew to over 100, which grew to over 1,000 by noon. A large part of that crowd included undergraduates and faculty who stood in solidarity with graduate students throughout the day; more than 50 S.T.E.M. students also had their own separate march from the Chemistry Lawn before merging into the larger rally at Storke Tower. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, about 80 faculty members across different departments — all wearing black and several wearing graduation regalia — met at Cheadle Hall and delivered their own demands to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, emphasizing that they believe there should be no retaliation against students or faculty for participating in COLA organizing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History professor Ann Marie Plane, who was one of the professors that delivered the demands, said in an interview that it was a “cordial meeting” but noted that administration and graduate students may have a hard time coming to an agreement over a COLA without “significant intervention, either by the university administration in Oakland, and/or the state legislature coming up with more funds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t recruit top quality graduate students without some kind of augmentation. Absolutely we’re going to lose students, lose the international quality and character of the institution,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the meeting, Marshall said “it would be most appropriate to take this struggle to Sacramento,” referring to the California legislature, since he estimates it would be around $40 to $50 million to meet UCSB’s COLA estimates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marshall added that because the strike is happening without the authorization of the graduate student union, United Auto Workers Union 2865, it is the “official line of the Office of the President” that it is “illegal for the university to negotiate with the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local political leaders also stood in solidarity with graduate students during the strike, including Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who is running for re-election, and I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud, who is running for State Assembly. Karen Jones, who is running against Hartmann for the supervisor seat, also came later in the day in support of COLA and to speak with COLA organizers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carlos Cruz, a second-year history doctoral student at UCSC who has continued to withhold his classes’ fall quarter grades, came down to Santa Barbara to speak at the strike, emphasizing the importance of UC-wide action in order to get a UC-wide response from UC President Janet Napolitano. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much what it comes down to is, what does solidarity mean? What does solidarity look like?

On Thursday, UC Santa Barbara graduate students </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/breaking-ucsb-graduate-students-vote-to-begin-full-strike-on-thursday-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will begin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their own wildcat strike, making UCSB the second UC campus to have gone on strike; UC Davis graduate students will also begin withholding undergraduate Winter Quarter 2020 grades beginning tomorrow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB 4 COLA is calling for a COLA of $1,807.51, but the amount UC graduate students are asking for is contingent on local housing costs and varies from campus to campus </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is unacceptable that Graduate students, the backbone of the UC educational system, should have to live rent-burdened and in poverty, forced to resort to a wildcat strike in order to advocate for a dignified wage,” the Senate resolution supporting graduate students read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution, authored by Off-Campus Senator Tianna White and Letters and Science Senator Olivia Campos, reaffirmed that the Senate is in “full support” of all UCSB 4 COLA demands. It also calls on UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang to “email UCSC administration and the UC Office of the President denouncing the threats to terminate wildcat strikers and request[s] that UCOP opens negotiations on a COLA for graduate students at all UC campuses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White said in an interview with the Nexus that she feels that the needs of graduate students are sometimes left out in the greater conversation of student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of times on undergraduate UC campuses, a lot of the emphasis is on undergraduate students and resources for them,” she said. “But I think a lot of times, people forget about graduate students and TAs and it’s not as big of a topic, not only on UC campuses, but nationwide.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos, who first learned about the COLA movement after one of her TAs “took the time to educate us on the issue” by holding her class’s section at the 16-hour-long Cheadle Hall </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sit-in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Friday, said “it’s insane that [a COLA is] a fight that our grad students have to go through because we feel so blessed to be at this institution, but so many people are struggling to make things stay afloat.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m a student who solely relies on financial aid through UCSB, as well as whatever FAFSA is able to provide me. So I’m just trying to fathom how I would barely be able to scrape by and have a healthy living situation,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond giving graduate students support from the resolution, White said that Associated Students (A.S.) also paid to reserve Corwin Pavilion for the COLA General Assembly meeting on Monday, where graduate students voted to begin striking on Thursday. In addition, Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi said during Senate that the Internal Vice President’s Office will “fund COLA for up to $1,000 for supplies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, a student sponsor on the resolution, was outspoken about the Senate’s lack of engagement with not just the COLA movement but with student activism this year, slamming his fellow senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People continuously come up to me, asking me, ‘Where are the elected representatives that we supposedly look up to?’ With the COLA movement going on, it’s not just enough for a couple of us to be showing up,” Segura said to the Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos and White, who both confirmed they will be present at Thursday’s wildcat strike alongside graduate students, emphasized the need for undergraduate support as a pipeline to create awareness about this issue and to rally the student body to support a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the strike at Santa Cruz started, they did not have a lot of grad students striking. They didn’t have any documentation of faculty support or undergraduate support. I think a really cool part about our [COLA] movement is that we’ve already started to document all this undergraduate and faculty support,” White said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And I think it’s going to be really helpful moving forward in our dealings with administration,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White also made note that although the lifestyles and responsibilities of graduate students are different from those of their undergraduate student counterparts, they are not mutually exclusive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Their living conditions are our learning conditions,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

He added that UCGPC performs systemwide and statewide advocacy and often works with the UC Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President (UCOP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strobel said that the timing of the UCOP’s </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-napolitano-s-statement-her-invitation-meet-graduate-and-professional-council\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Friday, combined with language that alluded to the potential discussion of a COLA, led some groups such as UCSC’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) to feel as if the UC was trying to circumvent ongoing demands for a COLA from organizers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strobel described the incident as a “misunderstanding” and said that UCGPC meets with Napolitano on a yearly basis, and, after its meeting in January 2020, UCGPC wanted to follow up with Napolitano on a handful of other issues. On Friday, Strobel said he was contacted by UCOP to meet again, to which UCGPC agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first discussion item listed in the UCOP press release was “cost of living,” followed by “housing.” Strobel maintained, however, that the meeting will not be about discussing a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The whole genesis of a potential board meeting with [Napolitano] and her team was to talk about state advocacy and some of the issues facing graduate students,” Strobel said. “But we’re not negotiating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And that’s a sentiment she also expressed to me,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students across the UC system have now begun organizing for COLAs of their own, and at UC Santa Cruz, where graduate students have been on a formal strike since Feb. 10, they have withheld Fall Quarter 2019 grades as part of a wildcat strike. Last Friday, around 500 UC Santa Barbara graduate students </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marched</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the University Library to Cheadle Hall, where they occupied the space from 8 a.m. to midnight in solidarity with UCSC graduate students who were given a midnight deadline on Feb. 21 to end their strike and submit the grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of today, UCSC graduate students are still on strike, as the original Feb. 21 “doomsday” deadline to submit Fall Quarter 2019 grades was extended to Feb. 27, according to an email sent to faculty and graduate students from Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the UCOP press release sent out on Friday, UCSC’s GSA sent an email to Napolitano, noting that UCSC does not have any representation on the council that she would be meeting with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For many reasons including, but not limited to, the fact that [UCGPC] does not represent our campus in any leadership or representational capacity, we are sorry to inform you that any decisions at which you may collectively arrive will not impact our organizing or our conviction,” the UCSC GSA wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, Cierra Sorin, president of UCSB’s GSA, said that the UCOP’s press release announcing a meeting with UCGPC was “uninspiring.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I don’t agree with that decision to reach out to UCGPC necessarily, since they have been pretty anti-COLA, I think it makes sense from a bureaucratic perspective,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Sorin said she doubted that UCGPC will specifically discuss a COLA at their meeting, she commented on UCGPC’s previous meeting at UCSB in early January, where she said “most of the folks in that room were anti-COLA.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite Sorin’s comments, Strobel said that UCGPC’s role is unrelated to the COLA movement. UCGPC is trying to alleviate rent burden through other measures, he said, such as reducing the cost of living for graduate students rather than advocating for a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve tried to go about it both in the the cost mitigating way, which is sort of open turf, like anyone can work on it,” Strobel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then in terms of increasing pay, that’s a little more of a complicated dance because you have other stakeholders who have been working on the issue for a long time, who have the legal first dibs to it, like the union, in which case we played an important, coalitionary partner to some of those folks,” he continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW 2865), the union that represents UC student workers at the bargaining table, UCGPC is a form of student of student government that describes its role as “complementary” to unions, according to the statement, and plans to continue advocating to “reduce the financial burden” of graduate students’ living expenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the midst of an ongoing battle between graduate students and the UC, Strobel asserted that UCGPC has no plan to negotiate a COLA in its upcoming meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do think it was an honest misunderstanding,” he said.   </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Cheadle Hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for 16 hours on Friday, demanding that Chancellor Henry T. Yang email UCSC administrators and UC President Janet Napolitano to “denounce threats” of firing against graduate students at UCSC and call for system-wide cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) negotiations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA movements have popped up at every UC campus except for UC San Francisco, but the amount students are asking for varies from campus to campus depending on local housing costs. UCSB 4 COLA is calling for a monthly amount </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,807.51</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which would be given to all graduate students regardless of individual salary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although housing costs have been an issue in Santa Cruz for years, UCSC brought the discussion of a COLA to the forefront starting in September 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After delivering COLA demands to administrators in November, UCSC graduate students began a partial strike in early December by withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades, which at least 85 graduate students still have not submitted, according to a UCSC Graduate Student Association (GSA) email sent to UCSC graduate students on Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest points of tension between administrators and strikers is the withheld grades, for which graduate students at UCSC have been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/janet-napolitano-ucsc-administration-warn-of-termination-to-striking-ucsc-graduate-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent termination warning letters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. UCSC Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer gave UCSC strikers a deadline of Friday at midnight to turn in grades and end their strike, but the graduate students voted at a meeting late Friday night to continue striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer sent an email Monday morning to UCSC faculty “to clarify that fall-grade submission … will be verified on Thursday, Feb. 27,” a change from the previous Feb. 21 deadline set by Kletzer to submit grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC GSA wrote in an email to graduate students that they </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider [themselves] terminated from [their] employment” and that as of Monday morning, 351 graduate workers have committed to withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades and several departments have committed to refusing Spring Quarter 2020 appointments if striking graduate students have their spring appointments revoked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Friday occupation of Cheadle Hall was organized in solidarity with the “doomsday strike” at UCSC, the name being coined due to the termination warnings and midnight deadline from administrators. Across the UC system, graduate students on almost </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/skamidi/status/1230910763281211392\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> held a demonstration, rally or other action in support of the UCSC strikers on Friday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC strike </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— and the imminent UCSB strike — is a wildcat strike, meaning that graduate students are acting separate from United Auto Workers Union 2865 (UAW 2865), the union that represents graduate students UC-wide. The current UAW 2865 contract extends until 2022, and a clause in the </span><a href=\"https://uaw2865.org/know-your-rights/contract/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contract states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “there shall be no strikes, stoppages or interruptions of work” while the contract is still active.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW 2865 </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQnj7hw2866SMHQiNM_NH1TWZQPm-cfG4CzlyohAl6s/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formally asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the UC to meet them at the bargaining table to negotiate a COLA for its members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cost of living concerns have consistently been a high priority for academic student employees, and we have bargained over these matters in every set of contract negotiations at the systemwide table since 2000,” UAW 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar wrote to Peter Chester, executive director of labor relations within UCOP. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe both the Union and the University have an interest in ameliorating the economic hardships faced by its academic student employees who face some of the most high-rent cities in the city and country, and welcome sitting down to negotiate over these matters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students have been organizing for a COLA since December, but most of the movement’s initial actions were in solidarity with the striking UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actions at UCSB began with a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-12-14/in-photos-ucsb-rallies-in-solidarity-with-ucsc-graduate-students/\">solidarity rally</a> in December and with a </span><a style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/ucsb-grad-students-hold-demonstration-in-solidarity-with-uc-santa-cruz-over-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">“sick-out”</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January, when approximately 150 graduate students, faculty and undergraduates marched from Storke Tower to the Arbor to coincide with the UC Regents meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers officially </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delivered</span></a> <a href=\"https://ucsb4cola.org/demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a COLA on Feb. 10 to Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall at Cheadle Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to calling for a COLA of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,807.51</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> per month, organizers demanded that the COLA payments do not come from “an increase in undergraduate or graduate tuition, campus fees, or university-owned housing rent.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers also emphasized that the university “must not retaliate in any form, implicit or explicit, against graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, or any other individuals who support and/or participate in the struggle for a COLA, regardless of citizenship or visa status.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands also say that the COLA must be adjusted from year-to-year depending on inflation, and that the university should further accommodate graduate students with dependents who might have additional financial needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We fight for a COLA not just for ourselves, but as part of a larger struggle for a dignified life for all at the university,” UCSB 4 COLA wrote in its demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A COLA is more than just a raise: it is a structural commitment by the institution, recognizing that this university would not function without graduate student labor.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers within the UCSB 4 COLA movement have emphasized the importance of undergraduate and faculty solidarity and have been circulating petitions calling on both of them to support the movement.

Besides the noon rally, the fifth floor occupation remained relatively uneventful, with organizers even setting up a projector to watch “The Matrix” later in the evening.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several undergraduates who attended sections at Cheadle Hall said that they were in support of the COLA movement and their TAs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The TAs are being exploited right now. There’s definitely some unfair practices happening around the fact that the UC Regents refuse to discuss it; it’s pretty disappointing,” said Kate Ripley, a first-year psychological and brain sciences major who was there to attend her Feminist Studies 30 section.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In college, I’ve noticed in all of my classes that I don’t get nearly as much instruction from professors as I do from the TAs. The TAs are there to talk to you personally. The TAs are always there for you,” said Jamie Donofrio, a second-year computer science major. “They need to live, and that’s kind of a thing where if a person needs to live, we need to be there to support them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Ripley’s perspective, the themes of Feminist Studies 30, which including unfair labor practices and exploitation, are relatable to COLA movements across the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just find it very disappointing that in this situation, the graduate students have been kind of villainized and made to seem that they’re asking for too much or asking for more than others, when they’re just asking for enough to survive,” Ripley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially with the police force that was used at Santa Cruz, it is just really disappointing. As someone who is paying tuition, I know my tuition is going towards police brutality, and that is really frustrating.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both at the noon rally and throughout the day at Cheadle Hall, COLA organizers emphasized the importance of undergraduate support, encouraging them to attend COLA meetings and bring their friends. On Tuesday, COLA organizers created an </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwc6XltN-1Yp6LEfO1GdZX7SDKnhgC583DhcQ4_YA_PplfRQ/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">undergraduate petition of support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which has already received hundreds of signatures in the past three days, according to Emily, a graduate student involved in COLA organizing who preferred not to give her last name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email to the Nexus, Yang noted that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate Dean Carol Genetti and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn invited COLA organizers and the executive leadership of the UCSB GSA to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss “the concerns of graduate students broadly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our campus has long had a culture of working collaboratively with our students to address concerns and provide support.

I think UC bureaucracy is trying to keep this limited to a single campus because then they think they can quell the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that, from her perspective, the representatives of UCGPC are “anti-COLA” and don’t represent the feelings of UC graduate students as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I guess my question at the end of the day would be why would she talk to COLA if she doesn’t want to legitimize the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC’s GSA sent an email to Napolitano, the UCSC administration and UCSC graduate students in response to Napolitano’s statement, noting that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC has nothing to do with the COLA campaign [and] has refused contact since its inception.” They added that there is no UCSC representation on that council. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kavitha Iyengar, the president of UAW Local 2865, issued a statement earlier this morning echoing Sorin’s concerns about Napolitano’s invitation to UCGPC, saying the council did not “have legal authority to bargain on the workers’ behalf.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Conflating COLA negotiations with UCGPC’s other advocacy efforts is an attempt to buy time and deflate the energy of this movement — and it will not work,” Iyengar wrote, adding that UAW Local 2865 had </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQnj7hw2866SMHQiNM_NH1TWZQPm-cfG4CzlyohAl6s/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formally asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the UC to bargain with the union for a COLA in Janaury. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB 4 COLA plans to hold a General Assembly meeting on Monday at 6 p.m. in the MultiCultural Center, where they intend to discuss their actions moving forward and prepare for the Tuesday meeting with administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think in part some of that is going to be determined by what is happening at Santa Cruz come Monday morning,” Sorin said. “If folks are receiving termination letters, that may escalate things here faster, it may not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a collective movement and we are really doing our best to ensure that we are not making decisions without as many voices as possible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Sorin said she was “floored” by the response on Friday, particularly from undergraduates and faculty, and hopes to continue building a UCSB coalition moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been here for five years. I’ve never felt this level of community with grad students, let alone with the rest of my campus.
