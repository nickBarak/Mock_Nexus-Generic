The plan outlined the benefits of a long-term approach, as opposed to planning on a year-by-year basis, stating it “enable[d] sustained progress toward addressing critical State needs that cannot be solved overnight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget reflects the multi-year framework by focusing on improving student graduation rates by way of investments in faculty hiring, course availability, academic advising, student services and industrial technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also includes funding for critical capital needs, student financial needs, student mental health and various equipment costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget proposal remains tentative, however, as it is dependent on the amount of state funding the UC Regents will receive for the 2019-20 fiscal year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A one-time fund of $145 million was provided by the state last year, “replacing revenue for core operations that would have otherwise been provided by a tuition increase in 2018-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents are requesting that this is incorporated into the permanent budget for the 2019-20 year in order to avoid cuts to existing programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this time, there is no proposed change in tuition or student fees for next year.

Now that the appellate court has definitively rejected this argument, the university calls on the administration to stop its efforts to rescind the program.”</p>\n<p>Under the Trump Administration, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke initially motioned to eliminate the DACA program in September 2017.</p>\n<p>Duke argued the program was “illegal from its inception” under the Obama Administration.</p>\n<p>UC <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-08/breaking-uc-files-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-for-unlawful-daca-repeal/\">filed a lawsuit</a> challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to repeal the program shortly after.</p>\n<p>The DACA program allows undocumented residents who were brought into the U.S. as children to apply for “two-year renewable periods” allowing them to stay in the U.S.</p>\n<p>In order to be eligible to apply, individuals must have clean criminal records and meet “various educational or military service requirements,” court documents state.</p>\n<p>In wake of Thursday’s decision, UC urged all eligible DACA recipients to renew their grants.</p>\n<p>“While today’s ruling is welcome news, we stress that DACA recipients deserve better than to see their life prospects rise and fall based on events in litigation.

A portion of the one-time funds could also potentially go toward 2018-19 enrollment growth.</p>\n<p>About $2 million of the one-time funds will be allocated toward efforts to increase diversity amongst faculty, along with $4 million toward legal services for the undocumented community on UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Additionally, $1.5 million will go toward addressing student hunger.</p>\n<p>About $35 million of the one-time funds will be used for deferred maintenance and $15.5 million for research, according to the senate bill.</p>\n<p>Napolitano has yet to release a statement on the signed Budget Act, and it is unknown at this time whether the funding was enough to prevent a future in-state tuition increase for UC students.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

the University of California, announced her resignation from the position in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i> last week.</p>\n<p>Salvaty began as a Title IX coordinator at UC Los Angeles and continued to live in Southern California after she received the position as the first system-wide coordinator.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <i>Nexus</i> on April 27, Salvaty said the distance from Southern California to the UC Office of the President (UCOP) in Oakland was part of her decision to resign.</p>\n<p>“It’s a system-wide job, and it’s certainly doable to do from the southern half of the state, but I also spent a lot of time in Oakland and at the Office of the President and that’s where my office was,” Salvaty said. “Ultimately, I think it was starting to take a toll on my family.”</p>\n<p>Salvaty discussed her time serving in the position and said that the most gratifying part was seeing the diversity of the UC campuses while recognizing that they were all similar in their commitments to trying to protect students and faculty.</p>\n<p>She also said a rewarding part of her time serving in the position was the formation of the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">Title IX Student Advisory Board</a>. The board is composed of one undergraduate student and one graduate student from each UC.</p>\n<p>The board has been focused on clarifying Title IX procedures as board members believe the procedures can be hard for students to understand, according to Salvaty.</p>\n<p>“We’re in the process of changing our student procedures, not fundamentally, but adding a lot of clarity,” Salvaty said. “We’re trying to be more clear about how it works.”</p>\n<p>She said the board is considering potential amendments to the system-wide policy.</p>\n<p>The policy amendments stem from a four-year federal investigation that revealed UC Berkeley violated Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, UC Berkeley released a <a href=\"http://complianceresponse.berkeley.edu/pdf/Signed%20Resolution%20Agreement.pdf\">Resolution Agreement</a> outlining new requirements agreed upon with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), a sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Education.</p>\n<p>The changes to the policies are expected to be finalized by the end of February 2019.</p>\n<p>Salvaty’s replacement, Suzanne Taylor, previously worked as an OCR Civil Rights Attorney. Taylor currently works within UCOP as a Title IX principle investigator.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained that she believed the most meaningful work she did within OCR was in the area of sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“My goal in serving as interim is just to continue the great work that she’s done of building the office and continuing with prevention and response efforts and really identifying and helping with implementation of those practices by the campus,” she added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Bates from the District of Columbia said rescinding DACA was “arbitrary and capricious,” echoing previous federal rulings earlier this year, claiming the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) failed to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful. <em>Courtesy of Wiki Commons</em></p></div>\n<p>The UC said in its statement that the ruling “mirrors the January decision in the University of California’s successful suit that unwound the administration’s attempt to rescind DACA.”</p>\n<p>The statement added that DACA program recipients “must be allowed to continue to legally live, work, learn, and contribute to this country as the Americans they are.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> reported in March that the United States Supreme Court declined to hear President Donald J. Trump’s appeal to have the court view the UC’s case on DACA.</p>\n<p>“The first set of challenges to DACA’s recession was filed in September 2017 in federal court in California,” according to Tuesday’s court <a href=\"https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2017cv1907-23\">documents</a>.</p>\n<p>Judge John D. Bates from the District of Columbia said rescinding DACA was “arbitrary and capricious,” echoing previous federal rulings earlier this year, claiming the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) failed to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful.</p>\n<p>Bates said in his decision that this marks “just two of a series of challenges to the September 2017 rescission of DACA that have already been before several district courts, two circuit courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court on two occasions.”</p>\n<p>According to Bates, neither the DHS’s legal reasoning nor its assessment of litigation risk was adequate enough to support its rescindment of DACA.</p>\n<p>The order will not go into effect until 90 days from now, giving DHS the opportunity to “better explain its rescission decision.” If the department fails to do so, it “must accept and process new as well as renewal DACA applications,” Bates said in his decision.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President specified they will not only continue to fight for DACA in the courts, but they will also urge Congress to pass legislation “that will provide permanent statutory protection for DACA.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/","id":3572,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[3571,3570,3569],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CSUs Will Not Raise Tuition in 2018","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2018-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=740%2C325&ssl=1","description":"California State Universities will not be raising tuition for the 2018-2019 academic year, according to a press release from the university system’s website.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California State Universities will not be raising tuition for the 2018-2019 academic year, according to a press release from the university system’s website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Timothy P.

tuition increase for out-of-state undergraduate students Thursday afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents voted 12-3 in favor of the tuition hike, which will add approximately $978 to yearly tuition costs for out-of-state students. The increase will go into effect at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year and is expected to raise $35 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano released a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-board-regents-chair-george-kieffer-and-uc-president-janet-napolitano-gov\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January expressing concerns about receiving less funding than expected from Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget plan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s budget proposal this year proposed only a 3 percent increase in funding allocated to the UC, down from 4 percent in years past. The state government typically increases UC funding to meet the ever-increasing number of enrolled students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been tabling and performing outreach to out of state students on our campus, and we’ve still yet to find anyone with 1,000 extra dollars floating around for next year’s tuition,” Spencer Brandt, UCSB Lobby Corps co-chair, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC admits meeting after meeting that a tuition hike is a band aid solution to a long term problem, caused by 20+ years of gubernatorial and state legislative divestment,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite receiving less state funding than expected, Napolitano said the university is committed to adding an additional 2,000 undergraduate students and 500 graduate students for the fall of 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many people who control the higher education committees in the Assembly and the Senate use their platform to score political points against the UC, and President Napolitano,” Brandt said. “Then when we take students to the Capitol to meet with them, they point the finger at the UC. And that’s worked for them for a long time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lobby Corps has a message for those legislators: UCSB students are not stupid,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristin Hsu, the external vice president of statewide affairs, has helped Lobby Corps prepare postcards asking students to “Fund the UC.” The postcards detail students’ demands and concerns and will be delivered to the state legislature at a conference next month, Hsu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What are the UC Regents expecting out of state students to sacrifice to pay for this tuition increase? The answer is physical and mental health, academic success, food and housing security,” Hsu said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, UC students are forced to pay for conflicts and disagreements among UCOP, the UC Regents, and the state legislature that we have no control over. That is an absolute shame,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will vote on an additional 2.7 percent tuition increase for in-state residents in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lobby Corps Internal Director Mayela Morales and other UCSB students attended the public forum of Wednesday’s Regents meeting to protest the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might’ve lost with out-of-state students this time, but we also have the proposed in-state tuition increase coming up in the May Regents meeting,” Morales said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morales said that she plans to lobby representatives in Sacramento to “allocate the sufficient funding to the UC system in order to buy out the tuition hikes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an issue that needs to be targeted through various tactics, but we have to remember that if it has been stopped before, we can do it again,” she added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

About $2.429 billion would come from changing the income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, $1.72 billion from eliminating Public Service Loan Forgiveness and $1.5 billion from eliminating subsidized loans, according to data from the Trump Administration.</p>\n<p>Currently, the government pays interest on subsidized student loans while students are in school or the loans are in deferment. If the changes in the new budget are enacted, the federal government would only offer unsubsidized loans.</p>\n<p>The budget suggests “streamlining”  IDR plans for student loans and altering the cap on the percentage of income for these plans and the length of payment.</p>\n<p>Currently there are several IDR plans dependant on income.</p>\n<p>Under the suggestions laid out in the budget, repayment would be capped at 12.5 percent of discretionary income, and balances would be forgiven after 15 years of repayment for undergraduates and after 30 years for graduate students.</p>\n<p>The proposed changes would “focus assistance on needy undergraduate student borrowers instead of high-income, high-balance graduate borrowers.”</p>\n<p>These new conditions would apply only to students borrowing loans beginning July 1, 2019, and would not apply to students who are already using student loans from the federal government.</p>\n<p>The budget also encourages Congress to pass a law that would make colleges and universities assume some of the financial risk associated with student loans.</p>\n<p>The budget also suggests changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.) and CalFresh, which is California’s version of the program. A portion of the monetary benefits that program recipients currently receive would be replaced with a box of food.</p>\n<p>Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), compared the proposed program to Blue Apron, the meal delivery service, at a press briefing.</p>\n<p>Mulvaney said it would cause “tremendous” cost savings.</p>\n<p>“It lowers the cost to us because we can buy prices at wholesale, whereas they have to buy it at retail. It also makes sure that they’re getting nutritious food,” he said.</p>\n<p>The reforms to S.N.A.P. would save about $17 billion, according to numbers the OMB produced.</p>\n<p>UCSB students who receive benefits from CalFresh would be impacted by the proposed changes.</p>\n<p>Rodolfo Herrera, the coordinator of the A.S. Food Bank, said the average student at UCSB receiving CalFresh benefits received about $150 per month.  He noted, however, that the amount students receive varies significantly.</p>\n<p>He added that international and undocumented students are not able to receive these benefits.</p>\n<p>He said the freedom of students to purchase foods from CalFresh is “really important” because recipients can use it to buy foods that don’t require a lot of cooking or processing, which he noted would matter especially to students preparing for finals or midterms.</p>\n<p>According to data provided by Herrera, CalFresh sales at the Isla Vista Food Co-op totalled $52,930 in 2015 and $68,000 in 2016.</p>\n<p>Herrera said the logistics of implementing Trump’s proposed program would be difficult, including storing large quantities of food and even keeping up with people’s addresses.</p>\n<p>“The big system programs that we have for supplemental nutrition for low-income families have been established for a few decades already.

He later only found out the union was involved when money for the union was taken out of his paycheck.</p>\n<p>“The union voice is not my voice. The union’s fight is not my fight. But a piece of my paycheck every week still goes to the union,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>He wrote that he took his job because he cares about kids, but said he no longer wants to pay union dues.</p>\n<p>He added that he is not anti-union, but that “unions aren’t a fit for everyone. And I shouldn’t be forced to pay money to a union if I don’t think it does a good job representing my interests.”</p>\n<p>Tom Steel, a third-year philosophy, ethics and public policy major and Teamster 2010 Student Organizer, said <em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME </em>would allow non-union members to “free-ride off the negotiating efforts of the union that everybody else pays into,” because labor unions are legally bound to represent them.</p>\n<p>Steel explained that non-unionized workers currently pay fair share fees that cover the cost of the bargaining contract that the workers benefit from, and that the case would make it so that individuals not represented by a union would no longer have to pay fees.</p>\n<p>“Free riders still have to be represented by the union. So if the free-riders have any grievances or any other issues like that, the union still has to expand resources to cover those members, even though those free-riders do not pay anything into the union whatsoever,” he added.</p>\n<p>Public sector union laws differ slightly from private sector unions, Young said. Public sector unions are funded by taxpayers, while private sector unions are funded by business entities.</p>\n<p><em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em> would affect public sectors unions. Private sector unions would not be similarly affected.</p>\n<p>“There’s two sets of labor laws. One way to think of it is the private sector is governed by a national labor law, whereas the public section is done state by state. We fall under the California State Labor Law Code, the teamsters who work at UCSB and other unions too,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Teamsters 2010 is statewide and covers all 10 UC campuses as well as the CSU campuses, according to Young.</p>\n<p>Young explained that when a similar law was passed in Wisconsin recently, public sector workers’ wages immediately decreased, and even the non-unionized workers saw their wages go down.</p>\n<p>“This just really hurts the whole economy because here at UCSB we’re the largest employer in Santa Barbara. Undercut my wages, then I’m not going to be able to shop locally, right, I’m just going to have to subsist on the bare minimum,” he said.</p>\n<p>Right now, unions act as a check on workplace safety issues and workplace discrimination, Steel said.</p>\n<p>“[Unions are] able to do that because they have the financial resources to provide resources for their members, to provide legal guidance to establish a fair and equitable workplace,” he said. “If the unions lose this financial backing, because free-riders won’t pay into the union, not only will they lose their strength, but this check on the employer is going to be diminished.”</p>\n<p>He explained that if <em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em> is passed, employees could face challenges similar to those from the late 1800s and early 1900s, where “employees did not have a voice that was able to combat the whims of the employer.”</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that this would weaken unions, and it would diminish the roles that unions have in their ability to protect their workers,” Steel said.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court will hear opening arguments for the case on Feb. 26.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 15 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

government without coming to a resolution for the children of undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump formally ended DACA on Sept. 5, 2017 and expects to fully end the program by March 5.</p>\n<p>It is uncertain where DACA will leave its 800,000 recipients at a federal level, but California legislators and the University of California (UC) have stated they will continue to provide support for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“If there’s a federal restriction, then there will be a restriction for federal resources for undocumented students in accessing them; however, for most resources they don’t need DACA to access, for example, The California Dream Act,” said Diana Valdivia, coordinator of Dream Scholars/Undocumented Students Services at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Valdivia said the California Dream Act, which allows undocumented individuals who have AB 540 status to apply for financial aid at the state and institutional level, will not be affected by DACA ending. Educational aid in California will not be affected regardless of DACA status.</p>\n<p>The UC Immigrant Legal Services Center will continue to provide legal services to undocumented students with or without DACA, according to Valdivia.</p>\n<p>In 2013, the UC Office of the President allocated $5 million across the 10 UC campuses for undocumented student support and later earmarked $8.4 million a year through the 2018-19 academic year to be divided among the UC’s DREAM Loan Program, Undocumented Legal Services and targeted undergraduate and graduate fellowships.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano also released a <a href=\"http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC-Community-DACA-FINAL.pdf\">statement</a> on Sept. 12, 2017, expressing support for undocumented students and prohibited UC campus police from contacting, detaining and arresting individuals based on suspected undocumented status.</p>\n<p>In September, Gov. Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">signed</a> Senate Bill 54, which declared California a sanctuary state, prohibiting local and state law enforcement agencies from collaborating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal received local <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/no-daca-no-deal-dont-take-your-students-for-granted/\">backlash</a> on his decision to vote for H.R. 195, since the government shutdown was later seen as a Democratic tactic to demand legal protection for undocumented students. His campaign platform was largely based on supporting undocumented students.</p>\n<p>At an open forum, Carbajal representative Elijah Ettenger said that Carbajal voted for H.R. 195 to maintain private assistance for mudslide victims in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>According to a Congressional Affairs Advisory document, certain requests for individual disaster assistance will no longer be possible during a government shutdown. These include requests for case management and crisis counseling, which would require review or approval from a furloughed employee.</p>\n<p>Trump has expressed openness to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/24/white-house-promises-new-immigration-framework-amid-stalled-negotiations-on-dreamers/?utm_term=.de1df0750fa9\">deal</a> that would create a path to citizenship for DACA recipients in exchange for funding of his promised wall at the border of the United States and Mexico. Valdivia did not offer an opinion on the possibility.</p>\n<p>“If you were to ask me and then you ask someone else, then their notion would be different,” she said. “It would be a political

after which they will begin their one-year fellowship in Jan. 2018.</p>\n<p>A press release by the UC Office of the President said the fellowship program is the core of the UC’s recently announced National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>The center aims to explore the issue of free speech on college campuses and American society as a whole.</p>\n<p>Claire Doan, director of media relations for the UC Office of the President, said the center is open to applications from everyone, but that they are specifically looking for established individuals in their respective fields.</p>\n<p>These include policy thinkers, legal scholars, social scientists and journalists who will be expected to use the opportunity to shape the national debate over free speech.</p>\n<p>The application, which is due on Dec. 11, requires a resume, a personal statement of 500 words or fewer and an outline of a research or project proposal, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>As part of their fellowship, fellows will engage with UC students at its Washington Program and spend one week in residence at one of the UC’s 10 campuses, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>Doan added that the UC will provide a $20,000 stipend to each fellow and that fellows do not need to be based in Washington, D.C. However, they must be able to travel to some events held at the National Center and to the UC campus to complete their residency.</p>\n<p>In the press release, UC President and Center Chair Janet Napolitano said the first group of fellows will be at the forefront of “fostering and broadening civil discourse.”</p>\n<p>In order to explore these free speech issues, fellows will conduct research or develop a project to advance the freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>This could take the form of creating a toolkit for campuses, a student app or a published paper, the press release said.</p>\n<p>“For the fellows, this is an opportunity to channel their expertise into advancing knowledge and discourse of the First Amendment and civic engagement,” Doan said.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the center will hold a national conference where the fellows’ year-long projects will be presented.</p>\n<p>The press release said that the purpose of the conference is to develop new approaches for educating students about the First Amendment’s role in American democracy.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div

voted on and selected at the UC Student Organizing Summit. Each campaign lasts two years. As a result, each year typically sees one returning campaign and one newly elected one.</p>\n<p>This year, however, UCSA will support three campaigns due to a tie in votes between UCSOS and reIGNITE, UC Santa Barbara representative on the UCSA Board of Directors Kristin Hsu said. These campaigns were selected by the UCSA Board of Directors, which is composed of student representatives from the different UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“By selecting them as UCSA campaigns, UC students are committed to increasing awareness and seeking solutions that can address these issues,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>We Are 3D, the newly-elected campaign, will advocate for an increase in resource allocation for disabled, chronically ill and neurodivergent UC students. The campaign is currently advocating for a free 24-hour transportation service, increased accessibility to classrooms and health insurance for pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p>The UCSOS campaign will address the widespread food and housing insecurity prevalent amongst UC students. The campaign organizers are currently attempting to coordinate a UC hunger and homelessness week and hope to establish a standard of living for students at a UCSA meeting with UC President Janet Napolitano in two weeks.</p>\n<p>reIGNITE focuses on the same issues addressed by the 2013-2015 I.G.N.I.T.E. campaign, which discussed the school-to-prison pipeline, issues of diversity on UC campuses and UC campus climate.</p>\n<p>According to Nushi Yapabandara, a fourth-year philosophy major and reIGNITE cofounder and campaign coordinator at UCSB, a total of $6,000 from UC student fees is allocated for the campaigns, though the funds are not necessarily distributed evenly among the three campaigns.</p>\n<p>This is the UCSOS campaign’s last year, while UCSA is solidifying reIGNITE as a permanent campaign renamed as permIGNITE.</p>\n<p>“Many of the system-wide issues that students organize around cannot be fixed in one to two years but it is extremely important that we do what we can with the time we have,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she worked to bring a resolution to UCSA asking to make permIGNITE a permanent campaign to carry out the campaign’s long-term goals.</p>\n<p>Daniel Nagey, UC Davis’s undergraduate representative for the UCSA Board of Directors, explained that the reIGNITE campaign plans to work towards affirmative action, establishing a UC-wide UC Police Department oversight committee and a student bill of rights at a university-wide level.</p>\n<p>The board also plans to engage in local, low-income community outreach, recruitment retention spaces and prison divestment awareness.</p>\n<p>Nagey said the two UCSA campaigns had “pretty low” success rates last year, which he attributes to the November elections. He said he believes last year’s political climate made UC student governments and the UCSA board feel hopeless, but said he was optimistic for this year’s campaigns.</p>\n<p>“This situation obviously still is bad, but the shock is not there,” Nagey said.  “I’m hoping that we can push through and get these demands met within the year.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Nushi Yapabandara is a fourth-year philosophy major, not a third-year, as previously reported. </em></p>\n<p><em>The article was also corrected to show that the reIGNITE campaign is already a permanent campaign. Yapabandara worked to bring a resolution to UCSA to make permIGNITE a permanent campaign. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/","id":3589,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[3588,3587,3586],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":5,"route":"/categories/news/uc-news","highestPage":7}},"__N_SSG":true}
