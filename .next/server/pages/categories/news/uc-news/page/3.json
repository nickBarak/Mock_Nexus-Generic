budget</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which allocates $36 billion for higher education across the state, offers a 5% increase in “base” resources for UC campuses, as well as funding for several specific programs on UC campuses, including the expansion of the UC Riverside School of Medicine, UC San Francisco School of Medicine and the UC San Diego Center for Public Preparedness Multi-Campus Research Initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important step toward covering the funds necessary to meet UC’s tripartite mission of delivering world-class education, conducting cutting-edge research and providing public service that benefits California and beyond,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Board of Regents Chair John Pérez and UC President Janet Napolitano said in a joint statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to ongoing funding, the budget aims to help students who require immigration legal services to defend themselves in court, support degree and certificate completion programs at UC extension centers and develop a UC Subject Matter Project in computer science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement by UC Student Association (UCSA) President Varsha Sarveshwar, who “welcomed” the proposed budget, she expressed hope that UCSA could work with legislators “to secure additional investments that reflect UC student priorities: investments in outreach and retention programs, mental health services, and resources for undocumented students, foster youth, and formerly incarcerated students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the budget proposal stated that “these investments are provided with the expectation that UC will continue to focus on maintaining college affordability, increasing student access, improving timely degree completion, and reducing achievement gaps,” it made no explicit mention of the services Sarveshwar detailed in her statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget also detailed expectations for the UC System, but it held no requirements to maintain current tuition rates. The UC has proposed a tuition increase over five years to fund financial aid and other campus needs, with the UC Regents voting on the increase Jan. 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarveshwar stated that “UCSA also hopes to work with the Governor’s office and members of the legislature to secure the funding necessary to avoid a tuition increase.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s proposed budget took into account the “significant growth” of the UCs in the past few years, and this year’s budget increase seems intended to do the same, as the proposal states that its 10 campuses now enroll more than 280,000 students, as opposed to far smaller numbers merely a decade ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newsom’s budget will not go into effect until it is voted on by the state legislature in June. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

committee selecting the next head of the University of California.</span> <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event, preceded by a town hall hosted on the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/the-uc-should-strive-for-better-students-faculty-and-stakeholders-share-suggestions-for-the-next-uc-president-at-ucla-public-forum/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> two days earlier, helps distinguish this search for a new president as being the first in which the Regents Committee have created space for public input.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the UCR speakers raised similar issues as those at UCLA, including advocacy for undocumented students and the need for climate change action, many statements addressed challenges facing the campus specifically. In particular, town hall attendees discussed difficulty the campus has had in meeting its goals of increasing student enrollment while also continuing to provide a quality and affordable education to its current student body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These inequities were recognized by many individuals present, including Robin Russin, a professor in the Department of Theatre, Film, and Digital Production at UCR. Russin expressed his frustration with the lack of funding given to the university to meet this challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need money; we need resources. We cannot grow without them,” Rossin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are already in a highly impacted situation … this idea of growing to 35,000 students [by 2035] is simply not real. It can’t happen. We’re already overstressed unless we’re given the resources for new faculty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christopher Chase-Dunn, a sociology professor at UCR, expressed bewilderment at the campus goal of expanding resources to accommodate 10,000 extra students within the next 15 years. He emphasized the ongoing challenges in addressing the already-expanding undergraduate student body with a limited amount of resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chase-Dunn, many faculty members remain “very concerned” about this issue since there does not seem to be a plan for sustainable growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we just expand and take care of all of the poor kids in California and solve the problem for the rest ofrestall the other campuses, we’re gonna be diplomable, doing online courses and handing out things, but it won’t really be an institution that meets the stands of the University of California system,” he stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The plan is to expand the campus hugely over the next few years, and we’re very concerned because apparently there’s no agreement on how we’re going to have enough resources in order to do that,” Chase-Dunn said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the students and faculty at UCR also condemned the current lack of resources and the fact that classes are held in old buildings with various utility issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Assistant Vice Chancellor and Campus Architect Jaqueline Norman, many of the buildings on campus were built during the early 1900s and during the 1950s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of these buildings have not had any significant renovation or improvements since their original construction,” Norman said. “Supporting contemporary learning and cutting-edge research in aging buildings with often failing infrastructure is a daily institutional challenge.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many also expressed their frustrations regarding a perceived status bias and disparity in funding allocations — </span><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2012/06/10/rebenching_budget_model_to_evenly_allocate_state_funds_per_student_to_each_uc_campus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a 2012 report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, showed an allocation of $398 million at UCLA, versus $154 million given to UCR and $117 million to UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are the lowest core-funded campus in the UC, heavily reliant on state funds, tuition and fees,” Jennifer Brown, a professor of public policy, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we need is a president … who will reverse the structural inequities which have existed across the system. As a woefully underfunded campus, UCR has fewer resources for our current students than other UC campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She pointed to figures obtained from UCR Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox’s office, which showed that UCLA receives $11,444 per student, while UCR receives $8,447 per student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We understand that there are weighted algorithms involved in this, but we still believe that this is an instance of institutional racism,” Brown said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She attributed this to the composition of UCR’s </span><a href=\"https://www.ucr.edu/about/ranks-and-facts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student body</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has a higher proportion of minority students compared to other campuses in the UC system on average. The student body, of which 86.6% identifies as a minority, has a higher overall ethnic diversity than </span><a href=\"http://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"https://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. More Pell Grant students are enrolled at UCR than at all of the Ivy League universities combined, and nearly 60% of the student body is made up of first-generation college attendees, according to data from the official </span><a href=\"https://www.ucr.edu/about/ranks-and-facts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCR website.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Therefore, we ask that the next president commit to funding UCR on a proportional basis equivalent to other campuses and erase the structural inequalities which are deeply eroding the quality of access at UCR,” Brown said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students also associated lack of funding as being especially harmful to minority or underrepresented groups, often drawing from their own personal experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silvia Ferrer, a DACA recipient at the university, spoke about navigating the legal difficulties associated with her immigration status.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferrera cited university support groups as critical in supporting her academic endeavors, but also described these programs as being “substantially underfunded,” which she said came as no surprise in light of the campus’s status as the lowest core-funded campus in the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent Rasso, director of government relations for Associated Students at UCR, said that the next UC president must work to help students facing urgent housing and food insecurities, issues which he attributed to being more pervasive at UCR among Black and Hispanic students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next UC president must be a strong ally to students by working diligently within university and legislative governance to uplift the voices of  students,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public commentary for the next UC president can be submitted to the Regents through email or postal mail, with the addresses on the Search Committee </span><a href=\"https://presidentialsearch.universityofcalifornia.edu/public-input.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec21eb515a0882fb7b969b6d32fa5b66?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec21eb515a0882fb7b969b6d32fa5b66?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/heather-carr/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Heather Carr</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Heather Carr is an Opinion and News staff writer.

Newsom Announces Proposed 2020-21 Budget (<em><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/01/14/ca-gov-newsom-announces-proposed-state-budget/\">Daily Californian</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget includes $36 billion for higher education, including community colleges, CSUs and the UC system. This is a $110 million increase compared to last year and specifically increases the UC General Fund by $217 million. The budget also includes $84 billion for K-12 schools and $750 million for a new state fund. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz: Continued Striking at UC Santa Cruz (<em><a href=\"https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/01/10/skilled-craft-workers-launch-indefinite-strike/\">City on a Hill Press</a></em>) </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Wednesday, the UC Santa Cruz American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) K7 workers were on their ninth day of striking; they announced earlier this month that striking would continue until the university presented them a contract that delivers “liveable standards.” K7 includes over 50 employees on the UCSC campus, such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters and HVAC mechanics. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCLA: UCLA Rejects Proposal for Students Experiencing Homelessness (<em><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/15/ucla-rejects-parking-space-proposal-for-students-experiencing-homelessness/\">Daily Bruin</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA rejected a proposal from the North Westwood Neighborhood Council and the Undergraduate Students Association Council, calling it “unsanitary” for students to sleep in their cars on campus. Instead, the administration suggested a “hostel-like” environment where students pay $15 per night. A small-scale version of the hostel program would include 100 beds and could potentially begin as soon as Fall Quarter 2020. The councils also called on UCLA administration to collect more data on students experiencing homelessness. Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck said in the meeting that it is difficult to identify students facing homelessness versus housing insecurity. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine: Irvine’s Housing Crisis (<em><a href=\"https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/01/13/irvines-housing-crisis-how-housing-insecurity-is-affecting-both-students-and-residents-in-irvine/\">New University</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New University looked back on housing trends over 2019, where increasing prices have led to lower home sales and greater housing insecurity for students and low-income people. These trends are coupled with lack of homeless resources, as earlier this year Irvine (along with four other Orange County cities) was sued for mistreatment of homeless people and lack of shelters in the city. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

mental health resources and addressing the climate crisis. </span><em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The search follows current UC President Janet Napolitano’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/upcoming-year-will-be-uc-president-napolitanos-last-in-office/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announcement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that she will be stepping down from her position on Aug. 1, 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion was held at UC Los Angeles, with students, faculty and UC system stakeholders sharing their advice, ideas and hopes for the type of president they would like to see next. Comments were directed to the </span><a href=\"https://presidentialsearch.universityofcalifornia.edu/special-committee.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special Committee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a temporary group appointed by the chair of the Board of Regents to consider and ultimately recommend a candidate for the position in question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ernesto Arciniega, a PhD student at UCLA, was first to speak. He articulated a desire for a president who, instead of admitting diverse students with the sole aim of fulfilling diversity quotas, “has a larger social consciousness, who truly commits to defend the voice of the voiceless,” a message that many other speakers echoed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 12 other student and faculty speakers at the public forum discussed college affordability, increasing mental health resources and addressing the climate crisis, but one of the most consistent demands raised by speakers that afternoon centered around electing a president who would resolve the contract dispute with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees 3299 (AFSCME) in the workers’ favor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME, one of the UC’s largest unions, has regularly gone on strike in the past few years over </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/afscme-calls-for-boycott-of-commencement-speakers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pay raises</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-06/afscme-files-six-new-unfair-labor-practice-complaints-against-uc-plans-to-strike-nov-13/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">minimum wage and outsourcing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under Janet [Napolitano]’s leadership, the UC has refused to provide the workers of AFSCME 3299 with a fair contract,” said Alexia Hatun, an undergraduate at UCLA. Hatun said she would like to see a UC president “who will respect the dignity of labor and that will end outsourcing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Michelle, a third-year labor studies major at UCLA, agreed with Hatun. Explaining that her friend, a residence hall housekeeper, works seven days a week and two other jobs in order to make a living, Michelle told the committee that she believes her friend is “employed by an entity that devalues her work.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is unacceptable and the UC should strive for better,” Michelle said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple speakers also emphasized that the new president should clearly indicate that the UC system will protect any undocumented students enrolled in the UC system from deportation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other stakeholders, like representatives from education organizations, K–12 teachers and UC alumni, spoke after students and faculty. Unlike the speakers before, stakeholders generally avoided direct criticism of Napolitano. Darlene V. Willis, co-founder of the Concerned Parents Alliance, was mostly alone in acknowledging that the next president will need to “help restore public trust and confidence in higher education institutions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, stakeholders suggested a more varied set of issues they would like the new UC president to tackle, though they did agree on a few common topics. One such topic was the need for increased collaboration between different educational systems in the state — as far back as pre-kindergarten — and with community colleges and the California State University system, according to speaker Carlos Iola.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s way more to be gained than lost through planned and purposeful partnerships,” said Anne Stanton of the Linked Learning Alliance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers mentioned that the transfer process in particular could be improved by such partnerships with community colleges, according to Darla Cooper, executive director of the Research and Planning Group, which focuses on increasing the success of California community colleges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooper said that prospective transfers “need a more holistic and integrated approach to ensure that they reach their ultimate goal of a bachelor’s degree and a better life for themselves and their families.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as applications to the UC system have continually surged, space is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the UC system, which Rachel Bonkovsky from the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools criticized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since 1980, we’ve built 23 prisons in the state, and we’ve opened the doors to one UC,” Bonkovsky said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next town hall will take place at UC Riverside on Jan. 16.

and cover the 16.7 acres of land up and down the street with up to 540 housing units — 180 two- and three-bedroom townhomes for sale and 360 rental units.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an unmet and sustained need for faculty and staff housing at UCSB, which has been exacerbated by Santa Barbara’s constrained and high-cost housing market,” the proposal wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The need for attainable, high-quality housing options remains a critical issue for recruitment and retention of faculty and staff at UCSB.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the proposal doesn’t specify the proposed costs of these units — only highlighting that they would be set at a “reasonable, market-based average sale price” —  it does note that according to a third-party site, home prices in Santa Barbara and Goleta over the last 30 days averaged $1.2 million, and that the average rent for the past five years was approximately $2,249, with a 98% occupancy rate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal noted that of the current faculty and staff housing options provided by UCSB, both </span><a href=\"https://www.oceanwalk.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ocean Walk</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, made up of for-sale properties, and Sierra Madre Apartments, made up of rental properties, are at 100% capacity. The wait list for Ocean Walk housing is at 185 people, and the Sierra Madre waitlist had been capped at 200.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In addition to providing clear indications of interest and demand, survey responses also confirmed long commute times (over 45 minutes) and distances (over 25 miles) for a significant number of faculty and staff, further highlighting the need for housing options close to campus,” the proposal wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the key differences of this project, compared to typical UCSB housing projects, is that it will include “30,000 to 55,000 gross square feet of retail space.” The university hopes to help alleviate the costs of the townhouses and apartments through a subsidy program, which will be funded, in part, by the “ground rent” generated by the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The rental and retail portions of the Project are expected to be developed, owned, and managed under a long-term ground lease,” the proposal stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the housing and retail space, the proposal said that the project would include “realignment of the existing Ocean Road roadway and physical improvements for connections to Isla Vista, new and replacement parking for the community, and open space, vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian pathways.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91421\" style=\"width: 1030px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2018 article by The Current</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a publication run by UC Santa Barbara’s public affairs office, boasted that the project would create a “dynamic residential community” and “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">redefine the border between Isla Vista” — but that is exactly the problem that Isla Vistans had with a former version of the project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly 15 years ago, in 2005, campus planners </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2005-10-26/project-renovates-ocean-road-to-aid-in-traffic-housing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approved</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a similar Ocean Road housing plan, which would involve 536 units divided into apartments, lofts and townhouses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was reported at the time that construction was scheduled to begin in 2007, but in 2009, the university postponed its attempt to demolish Ocean Road amidst severe public pressure to halt the project, the Nexus</span> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-01-28/officials-pause-ocean-road-proposal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported in 2009</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-02-05/vision-2025-apt-to-give-ucsb-bad-eyesight/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">op-ed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the university’s previous attempt denounced the 2009 program, noting that the project would involve tearing down the famous eucalyptus trees that line Ocean Road; similarly, in recent months, a few citizens have shown up to Isla Vista Community Services District meetings expressing similar concerns about the trees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the current plan is approved, Student Health would also need to be relocated from its current location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2018 Current piece also said that “input from people both on and off campus will again be crucial, and multiple opportunities for such public discussions will be provided and welcomed every step of the way” — but no such publicization of the project has been prevalent until the Regents meeting last week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Outreach and community engagement were central to the original Ocean Road proposal and project approval, and they will remain important considerations throughout the project planning stage and beyond,” UCSB spokesperson Shelly Leachman said in an email about the project in June 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leachman added that the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of UCSB Community Housing Authority on campus had administered a survey to students, staff and faculty earlier in the year regarding the Ocean Road Housing project, and that the office planned to conduct additional surveys as the project planning continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act, the university will prepare an addendum to the 2010 LRDP Environmental Impact Report. T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hat addendum, along with designs, will be considered for approval by the UC Regents in a public meeting in January 2020.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal presented to the Regents updated that timeline, confirming that the UC Regents would be presented with the business terms for the project in the first financial quarter of 2020, and the design plans and “an environmental document pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act” in the second or third quarter of 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is “is currently in the final stages of a robust solicitation process” to select the developer for the project, according to the proposal, after which it will be able to “finalize the key business terms for the Project and to implement predevelopment agreements to finalize design, planning, entitlements, and Project approvals.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Daily Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-13/uc-study-abroad-suspends-spring-hong-kong-program-citing-safety-concerns/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Wednesday that the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) was cancelling its spring study abroad programs amidst concerns for student safety and was considering evacuating its 79 Fall 2019 study abroad students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, however, the program decided to leave the decision to leave Hong Kong up to the students themselves.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP spokesperson Myla Edmond said the program sent an email to students last Friday “strongly urging them to leave Hong Kong as soon as possible,” adding that UCEAP was uncertain if local transportation and the airport would be affected — another cause of concern. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edmond declined to specify the number of students who were leaving and the number who were staying, citing privacy concerns, but said that UCEAP had heard from all of the students who were abroad and confirmed that many of them would be leaving Hong Kong in the coming days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only a few who had family in the area would be staying, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP will be covering all the costs of changing travel plans, Edmond said. However, one of the biggest pieces of information is still up in the air: whether or not students will receive their course credits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We definitely don’t want them to lose an entire term due to issues that have nothing to do with them; it’s beyond their control,” Edmond said. “Some of them will be taking online courses, so we’re still trying to work out the details for that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that each student’s academics would be dealt with by the universities they were attending in Hong Kong: University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several universities </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/business/hong-kong-protests-recession.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cut their semesters short last week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> without coordinating with students and instructors about completing courses for the term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anita Carraher, a third-year environmental studies major who was studying abroad at the Chinese University of Hong Kong this semester, said in an interview with the Nexus on Sunday that she was still waiting to hear from several professors about how she would be able to finish her courses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know Hong Kong University announced that they would be having online classes, and most other universities have also announced some type of either online form of classes or have also just cancelled classes, but specifically with Chinese University [of Hong Kong], they cancelled classes before they decided how they were going to finish up the semester,” Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Nov. 11, the Chinese University of Hong Kong cancelled classes for the day; later that night, they also cancelled classes for Tuesday, and on Tuesday, classes were cancelled for Wednesday, Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until Wednesday, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-students.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=fb-nytimes&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ns3WNd1rmpfZ_NDQBZQI4oY-yHNZkQC9rWNLSD_2JqDKVaRf8RZeXIZw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amidst violence at the edge of campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that the university cancelled classes for the entire term.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Chinese University of Hong Kong — where the university is made up of several different independent colleges — it has been more difficult to coordinate course completions, especially since each college has its own protocols, Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some students on campus were evacuated from their dorms, while others like Carraher were not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carraher is currently staying with family in Hong Kong but said that she has heard from other students that coordinating housing during the time period has been difficult, particularly for students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where students were not allowed to return to campus due to high concentrations of tear gas chemicals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the university had been working with students to arrange off-campus housing for students up to Wednesday, after which they were expected to leave Hong Kong or secure their own housing, Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carraher, whose stay with family was initially meant to be temporary, had left all her belongings on campus. As of Sunday, she was waiting to hear whether she could return to campus to retrieve her luggage. On Wednesday, she said she would be traveling around Asia for a few weeks and would try to return to campus later in December. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before she arrived in Hong Kong, Carraher said there had been talk about whether or not the exchange program would be cancelled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s] a really different look now, comparing those protests [over the summer] to what’s happening now. It’s definitely gotten more and more extreme, especially when it [has] come to police treatment, of not just students, but to me, I thought the most alarming thing most of the time was police treatment of press,” Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although students studying abroad in Hong Kong received messages from friends back home asking about their safety, Carraher and two other UCSB students in Hong Kong, Rita Lake and Emma Xing, maintained that as long as they stayed informed about where protests were occurring, they weren’t particularly in danger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Besides the transportation thing, the protests haven’t really affected us that much because exchange students mainly don’t really protest or get involved in any of this, and as long as you don’t get involved, you’re not really in any sort of danger,” Xing said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lake, a fourth-year political science and art history double major, and Xing, a third-year history and philosophy double major, were studying at Hong Kong University when the roads to campus were blocked by protestors. Once classes were suspended and UCEAP emailed them recommending they leave Hong Kong, Lake and Xing went to China to stay with Xing’s grandparents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two are currently completing classes online, and Lake noted that her professors have been “really accommodating,” particularly since many of her courses had relied on group projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they finish up their coursework, Lake and Xing plan to spend the rest of their semester in China before their previously scheduled trip to Thailand in mid-December, after which they’ll be returning to the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know a lot of my friends have been asking me, ‘Are you okay?’ ‘Stay safe,’ and I guess I just wanted to say that I was never really in danger in the first place,” Xing said. “I think we’re really privileged to be able to leave the situation, because obviously if you’re a Hong Kong student, if you’re a Hong Kong resident, you can’t leave the situation because that’s your home.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do feel very privileged to be able to leave.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11/29]: The story has been updated to remove references to Hong Kong as a country; <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/topics/reference/hong-kong-history-explain-relationship-china/?fbclid=IwAR2ofMqoKoDbZjgl4Cr7feqazjNSX9bjrDDoX3KqQDrnhRSJjkj2ONQdmRY\">while it operates</a> as its own country, it is technically a territory of China.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 21, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-91417\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ora spoke at the Nov. 13 Regents meeting, accusing Kieffer of sexual misconduct against her in 2014. <em>Courtesy of UC Regents Video.</em></p></div>\n<p>During the board meeting’s public forum, Ora, the external vice president of the UC Santa Cruz Graduate Student Association, accused Kieffer of grabbing her thigh numerous times throughout a dinner between Kieffer and various undergraduate and graduate students, held prior to the Regents’ board meeting in July 2014.</p>\n<p>“Kieffer purchased wine for the table despite the undergraduate students present. I do not drink and did not drink that night, but Kieffer did,” Ora said during public forum.</p>\n<p>“At one point in the conversation, I was shocked to feel pressure on my upper thigh and looked down incredulous to find Kieffer’s hand firmly grasping my leg. This persisted throughout the evening. I was unsettled, uncomfortable and felt powerless to stop this figure of authority from putting his hands on my body.”</p>\n<p>Kieffer, a UC Santa Barbara alumnus, has served on the Board of Regents since 2009, and his term is set to end in 2021.</p>\n<p>UC spokesperson Claire Doan said in an email that due to student privacy laws, she could not comment on specific allegations raised at the board meeting but said the University of California “takes these allegations — as we do any allegations — seriously.”</p>\n<p>Ora’s testimony also shines a light on the difference between the University of California and the UC Regents when it comes to handling sexual misconduct allegations — all decisions regarding Regent misconduct are handled by the Regents themselves, according to <a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/1112.html\">Regents Policy 1112</a> .</p>\n<p>Ora told the Nexus that she has experienced instances of sexual misconduct before but said the power differential between herself and Kieffer limited her voice in the reporting process.</p>\n<p>“I was in a train station and somebody put his hand on my behind and squeezed, and I turned around and punched him in the stomach. That is who I am. But when you’re sitting next to somebody who’s talking about being best friends with [former California Governor] Jerry Brown, and you’re in a public space, you can’t punch him in the stomach,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>“The difference in power among people determines the type of response they’re capable of having in that moment. And I know it’s opening up a huge amount of complexity, but when a power differential was so steep that you literally cannot stand up for yourself, that makes whatever is occurring so much worse.”</p>\n<p>Ora said that she is the first person to go through the Regents misconduct investigation process, described in Regents Policy 1112, which outlines the specific policy for allegations of misconduct against a Regent.</p>\n<p>“Apparently the UC Regents have a policy all their own, written by the Regents, which states that all complaints against a Regent will be handled by the Regents … with a clear focus on ensuring the utmost delicacy toward the powerful Regent reported, rather than the individual reporting,” Ora said during public forum.</p>\n<p>“In the words of a Title IX employee, ‘In the Regents policy, I, the complainant, do not even exist.’”</p>\n<p>In response to Ora’s allegations, UC Student Association, the UC Graduate and Professional Council and the UC Council of Student Body Presidents published a joint statement on Nov. 20, supporting Ora and condemning the process for reviewing misconduct cases against the Regents.</p>\n<p>“We believe Rebecca, and we agree that the process for reviewing her case is deeply flawed. Regents Policy 1112 essentially requires Regents to hold themselves accountable by tasking a three-member panel of Regents to oversee an investigation. This is not survivor-centered, trauma-informed, impartial, or just, and it clearly prioritizes the powerful over those who may have been harmed,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>The leaders further called on the Regents to adhere to the same Title IX policies as students, staff and faculty, calling for further accountability by state elected officials.</p>\n<p>Ora first spoke during a June 2018 Regents meeting about her general experiences navigating Title IX as a graduate student — not relating to Kieffer — and was approached by someone following her comments.</p>\n<p>Ora said she had told the person about what had reportedly happened with Kieffer in 2014, when he let her know that he was a “responsible employee,” also known as a mandated reporter, which means he is required by UC Title IX Policy to report Ora’s story as an instance of “sexual violence, sexual harassment or other conduct prohibited by the policy to the Title IX officer or designee.”</p>\n<p>Ora was given a few options by the case’s mediator: pursue a case against Kieffer, or let it go. If she pursued a case, she would have to decide whether to go directly into an investigation against Kieffer or attempt to settle through the internal alternative resolution process, where a mediator would handle the case directly with the appointed Regents.</p>\n<p>“Even though I’ve been a student leader for so many years, it took me this horrendous conversation to realize like, ‘Oh, wow, I do need to follow this through,’ because it’s not a matter of whether I’m okay or not and how many meetings I have to step out of and avoid. It’s a matter of somebody with such lax judgment is determining the consequences of all of the perpetrators in the system,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>During public forum last week, Ora said she was encouraged at the time of reporting to “informally resolve the matter so as to avoid an investigation” and said in the interview that she felt pressured then by the case’s mediator to first handle the case internally.</p>\n<p>“I was given no direction and I had no idea what to choose, so I just chose the one that seemed the safer one.”</p>\n<p>But Ora said that earlier this year, the alternative resolution to handle the case internally failed. She described the Regents’ response to her allegation as “deeply disappointing.”</p>\n<p>“They were so invisible on any item that was clear to me that there was no use bothering to continue negotiation,” she said.</p>\n<p>Ora’s case will now move on to the outside investigation process.</p>\n<p>Ora told the Nexus she chose to speak during public forum due to frustration not only with the Regents’ system, but the entire University of California process for investigating sexual misconduct, which takes years and often re-traumatizes the person reporting sexual misconduct in the process.</p>\n<p>“We should have a system that doesn’t discourage and exhaust people who stand up for themselves and what’s right. And in order to protect other people, we should have a system that encourages them. This is not that system,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>At public forum, Ora discussed how the years-long investigation process has personally affected her, specifically her mental health and relationships.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been told not to bother trying to fix the world and told to let it go. I’ve been excluded from committees because of Kieffer’s presence, I experience regular panic attacks and have fallen behind in my academic progress. I’m afraid of being hacked and of being harassed and followed, as I’m aware other [people who reported sexual misconduct] have been.

And I do think that is a problem, like yes, somebody did something to me … it did harm me. What I think is the larger and more long-term problem to fix is UC Regents wrote a policy for themselves that is unjust and inappropriate,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>“This all happening at this very moment that we have impeachment hearings going on in the government, we have to beg the question of what is oversight of power,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>“If the standards for them are lower than those for the rest of us, then we’re doing something horribly wrong.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Finding a place to live is hard,” he said. “I slept on campus because I was too scared to go outside and look for housing as someone who’s a foster and formerly incarcerated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprise resonated on the Regents’ faces.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is horrifying to hear,” Regent Sherry Lansing said. “We should take action on this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources such as the UC Santa Barbara Guardian Scholars Program (GSP) and Berkeley Underground Scholars exist throughout the UC system, offering academic and career advising as well as scholarships for foster and formerly incarcerated students, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a lack of funding and outreach have limited their effectiveness, Borges and Hoang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borges elaborated on UC Berkeley’s own version of GSP — Berkeley Hope Scholars (BHS) — as an example. While BHS does supply emergency housing to students when dorms are closed during holidays, relatively few people know that they can apply for a space, and so most are “kicked out” during winter break, according to Borges, who added that acceptance is limited and based on a lottery system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, Borges said, students are forced into “the most inadequate” off-campus housing with mold, abusive or neglectful landlords and residents with little concern for their well-being. Securing more suitable arrangements would require parents to sign leases, money to pay deposits and a family tax history — but, as Hoang stated, “There’s no relying on mommy and daddy to get any of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a potential recourse, Borges said; passed years ago, California State Legislature bills </span><a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB1393\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB-1393</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1228\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB-1228</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> require the California Community Colleges and the California State University systems to give priority year-round housing to foster and homeless students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this requirement does not apply to the UC system until the Regents formally enact it into policy. And so far, according to Borges, they haven’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I’m here to ask,” she continued regarding the bills, “is to maybe put it on your radar.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond housing, Hoang proposed other changes that would benefit the foster and formerly incarcerated student population after graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His recommendations included awarding fellowships to alumni to compensate for the extra hands, resources and living space that parents would normally provide in an initial job search; hiring more foster and formerly incarcerated people as employees of the UC system, since they know best how to solve the problems that they themselves face every day; and re-evaluating the use of criminal background checks for certain jobs in the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoang said there is a combined, approximate total of 160 foster and formerly incarcerated students at UC Berkeley, based on the memberships of BHS and Berkeley Underground Scholars. However, he pointed out that, based on his research, the true count includes an “undetected number of about double that” — by including those who do not wish to make their history known due to the potential stigma in doing so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For their part, the Regents appeared receptive to the presenters’ suggestions. “I think those are recommendations we should seriously consider if we are truly committed to opening the doors to students who are not what we think of as a traditional student in the UC, which is primarily becoming the majority of students in higher education now,” Regent Eloy Ortiz Oakley stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the recommendations “seemed to be no-brainers to me,” said Regent Christine Simmons, who volunteered to head a task force to decide on short- and long-term changes within the UC system while conferring with Borges, Hoang, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ and other students interested in voicing their feedback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlighting the need for collaboration and communication to solve issues on a more fundamental level, Lansing advised broadening the task force. “It seems to me it shouldn’t just be us [implementing these recommendations] … I think it should be the community colleges, Cal State and obviously UC,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a crisis that we have to address.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91306\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91306\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/","id":3516,"author":{"id":237,"name":"Yiu-On Li"},"related":[3515,3514,3513],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Committee Moves Forward With Plans for Permanent A.S.

Bike Shop began its operations in 1974, working out of two corrugated steel shipping containers. The original facility had no running water or electricity, and structural decay posed threats to staff members and patrons, the report stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current building was created in 2008 to replace the shipping containers, adding plumbing and electricity and addressing the most shop’s critical needs. But what was meant to be a temporary solution has now been in place for over a decade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building’s downfalls are especially felt during the beginning of fall quarter, senior mechanic and fourth-year earth science major Estefania Franco said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have tons of supplies and especially when it comes to fall quarter, we get extremely busy and it’s kind of hard to help others in maintaining their bikes because we can’t house that many bikes here, which we do in case people don’t have time to stay with us until their repair gets done or if it’s a little bit [of a] longer repair,” Franco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The community keeps growing, but the shop stays in this constant space that doesn’t allow us to help out the growing community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current attempt to find a permanent space for the bike shop is not the first. Previous A.S. presidents have incorporated plans for the space into redesigns of the University Center (UCen). Most recently, in spring 2018, President Hieu Le introduced a ballot measure to pay for the UCen redesign that would include a dedicated space for the bike shop, but when students voted not to move forward with renovations, the bike shop plans fell through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until A.S. President Brooke Kopel, who served during the 2018-2019 academic year, took office that plans moved forward for a bike shop entirely separate from any other designs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel met last year with Mark Nocciolo, director of the Office of Budget and Planning, to discuss designs and locations. Nocciolo and Kopel intended to submit plans for the bike shop during spring of last year but were unable to when the last two campus planning committee meetings of the 2018-2019 year were cancelled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project has since moved forward into the current year, with current A.S. President Alison taking over for Kopel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They both have that sort of real conviction to get this done,” Nocciolo said. “And we’re doing all we can to make that happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Campus Planning Committee approved plans to move forward with the bike shop during its Oct. 30 meeting and now plans to hire an architect to move forward with design and location plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The committee for the bike shop’s permanent location is a collaboration with Sir, Nocciolo, others in the Campus Planning Committee, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and employees at the bike shop. The committee created a list of space needs for the building and new location, including bike path accessibility, a garage door, a safer location for test riders than the current parking lot, increased indoor space and bike-specific storage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Campus Planning Committee has opened the search to 11 sites, which may increase when an architect is hired, the bike shop identified four locations they would prefer: by the Thunderdome, by the Student Affairs Building, by the UCSB bus loop and in the Old Gymnasium Building. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of these four, Franco expressed that the Thunderdome is the preferred location of bike shop employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It already has some good plumbing and electricity situations, which would make it really ideal, especially because since it is on campus, it would make a really easy kind of for everyone since it belongs to the school,” Franco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the bike shop supports the Thunderdome location, Nocciolo has purposefully kept the location list open instead of recommending one for the Campus Planning Committee at this stage in the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our project proposal, we included all the sites that we looked at, and we did that so that the committee would recognize that this is a process that is going to have more than one set of eyes looking at it. We felt as if it made more sense for the committee to see the array of possible sites rather than saying it’s this site or that site or this other site,” Nocciolo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Nocciolo saw the immediate importance of a permanent shop location, he believes architects and the Campus Planning Committee must take into account the long-term growth of the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are instrumental in this activity; we will definitely want to have a committee involved, and students are always a part of these things. Student funds — they need to have a say. But we also need to have our eye on the long-term interests of the institution. We have a long range development plan that is going to live beyond us,” Nocciolo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want it to be in a place that makes sense for the long term so that it is indeed permanent and that we’re not asking to have it moved again. We don’t want to forego any future development that would be really important to the academic program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is also currently discussing master circulation of pathways, sidewalks, bike paths and roadways, according to the report, so Nocciolo doesn’t want any current bike shop plans to get in the way of other development projects in the works. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that an architect has been hired, Nocciolo says it is a “realistic goal” to have the project approved by the Campus Planning Committee by the end of the academic year, so construction can commence during the summer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For bike shop employees like Franco, the change can’t come soon enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The bike shop should grow as the community of biking grows. We see more and more students come in with bikes every year, but [our current location] is slowly limiting the amount of people we are able to help.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yu</em></a></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to suspend the spring study abroad program was made now to ensure that students who were planning to study abroad in Hong Kong will be able to transfer to a different program or coordinate housing and classes at their home campuses if they choose to stay in the U.S., Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We felt that rather than have them go, potentially be in an unsafe situation and have to worry about evacuating them… it would be preferable to not have them go,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray added that the program is keeping a close eye on the protests in order to gauge whether to evacuate the students currently studying abroad in Hong Kong. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are currently 79 UC students in Hong Kong taking courses through the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), seven of whom were scheduled to stay in Hong Kong for the full academic year. In addition to those seven students, 12 other students were expected to study abroad in Hong Kong in the spring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said there were originally 90 students scheduled to go to Hong Kong in the fall, but after UCEAP offered them the option to switch programs or postpone their studies abroad due to the protests, 11 students chose to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been monitoring the situation since the summer,” Nyitray said. “So this wasn’t a decision that was either made lightly or out of any kind of haste or panic.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As the protests again continued to escalate further, and the response has been so unexpectedly strong from the police, with people being shot at with live ammunition, we felt that we really needed to evaluate this very, very carefully,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said the program’s first priority was ensuring the safety of UC students who are currently in Hong Kong, all of whom are attending one of three schools: University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Two out of our three partners [University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong] are now actually sites of protests and violence, and the faculty and staff are having difficulty getting to campus if they live at any distance because of the transit systems being shut down,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-students.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=fb-nytimes&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ns3WNd1rmpfZ_NDQBZQI4oY-yHNZkQC9rWNLSD_2JqDKVaRf8RZeXIZw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Wednesday that police in Hong Kong had begun “raiding the edges of the biggest campuses to make arrests.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday night, police officers and students clashed near the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong; “police officers fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets and students hurled Molotov cocktails and bricks, and practiced firing bows with flaming arrows,” according to the Times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said that while it hasn’t reached the point where UCEAP will “actively evacuate” students currently in Hong Kong, students have been given the option to end their programs early and return home. UCEAP and its partner universities in Hong Kong have been working with students to ensure they will receive course credit for their terms, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She explained that as the protests escalated, there were “a number of [non-UC universities] who didn’t send students this fall at all,” while others have now “pulled [students] back and have simply told them ‘you must come back now.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But because the UCEAP program is unusual in that it has such a large number of students, “we really wanted to not just jump in, we wanted to really assess the situation and give the students optimal chance to remain, to have the academic experience that they wanted to have, before we pulled out,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also added that if students were sent to Hong Kong in the spring and had to be evacuated, they might not be able to receive credit for the classes they were taking or be able to enroll in time at their home campuses for the quarter or semester. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re trying to balance the academic and the financial consequences for the students, you know, we don’t want any of the students to suffer at all,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP has not determined if they will suspend the Hong Kong summer abroad programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just so unclear — it’s unclear to our partners, it’s unclear to us,” Nyitray said. “We’ve been monitoring the State Department updates every day, and we have been monitoring local news, not only the foreign news, but local news, and of course we have our partners on the ground.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray noted that the State Department security level for Hong Kong is level two, or “exercise increased caution,” which she said was the same security level as most of Western Europe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With the violence and the protests having moved to the campuses themselves, we feel that the situation warranted extra caution.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

et al. v. Regents of the University of California, et al. — has worked its way through the federal court system and is a combination of the University of California (UC) case as well as similar DACA cases in the District of Columbia and New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was created by an executive order under former President Barack Obama in 2012. The program provides two-year repeated deferments from deportation and a work permit to individuals who arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB74r7NE0A7btCgQX8od_5u0oogA\">website</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legal battle began in September 2017 when acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607871000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDw312g5cu8l9yoc1brbCBOrktxw\">announced</a> the Trump administration was ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just three days after the decision to end DACA was announced, the UC filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, becoming the “first university board to sue the government,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-filing-amicus-briefs-support-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607874000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcVJLBEAIOAKsdIDfspxkSgAjUuw\">press release</a> from the UC Office of the President (UCOP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit puts UC President Janet Napolitano in a unique position. As president, her office is leading the fight nationwide to protect DACA — the signature legislation she helped create in 2012 as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security for the Obama administration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Neither I, nor the University of California, take the step of suing the federal government lightly, especially not the very agency that I led,” Napolitano said. “To arbitrarily and capriciously end the DACA program, which benefits our country as a whole, is not only unlawful, it is contrary to our national values and bad policy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are nearly 700,000 DACA recipients currently in the program, which includes “approximately 1,700 UC students,” according to UCOP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC-DACA-Complaint.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607872000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbbp7en5OHiiYOlbelFwnekcqrXg\">lawsuit</a> alleges the Trump administration rescinded the program on “nothing more than unreasoned executive whim,” and that its removal is “unconstitutional, unjust, and unlawful.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal court granted an injunction to temporarily stop the Department of Homeland Security’s recission of DACA in January 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an unusual attempt, President Trump tried to bypass the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s hearing of the case, moving directly to the U.S. Supreme Court — but the justices denied his appeal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case went on as scheduled to the Ninth Circuit, and in November of 2018, the court ruled in favor of the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last June, the Supreme Court announced it would hear the DACA case in November 2019, beginning oral arguments this upcoming Tuesday, with expectations to have a decision in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case presents two specific questions: whether it is up to the courts to decide DACA’s fate, and if so, whether the decision to rescind the DACA program was “arbitrary and capricious.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is no dispute that this decision has life-changing implications for nearly 700,000 DACA participants and their families,” the Regent’s briefing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/20190927151220415_18-587-Regents-Brief-for-Respondents.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607878000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEj-h4CmfaWS_4hT0IjEYZhwmfjMg\">reads</a>. “Yet the Acting Secretary provided only a single vague sentence of explanation for the decision that leaves basic questions unanswered.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-president-janet-napolitano-filing-supreme-court-brief-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzPIBYHwjcOkR8r6nf7IsxddiKjQ\">statement</a> released in September, Napolitano argued that the Trump administration acted illegally because it offered no “valid justification” for ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Five federal courts have considered this issue and found that the administration’s decision was arbitrary and capricious, and therefore unlawful,” Napolitano said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court briefing mentioned that the administration waited seven months to end the program and that Trump had previously indicated he “would allow DREAMers to stay.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Department of Homeland Security argued that DACA is illegal because it is a violation of immigration law and was enacted not through Congress, but as an executive order under former President Obama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[DACA] was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,” said former acting Secretary of Homeland Security Duke in memorandum announcing DACA’s recission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the past month, UCOP began a system-wide campaign in support of DACA, including a social media campaign where prominent UC leaders and national politicians have given reasons for why they stand with DACA recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign also includes an online <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actnow.io/embed/widget/app/vwOv7u9?parentPage%3Dd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNpdHlvZmNhbGlmb3JuaWEuZWR1L2RhY2EtYnVpbGQ%253D%26frameId%3Dj1ild&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607880000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKYXoHlNlEl8qhWsyHHYOGX-2YYA\">pledge</a>

The organization Home is Here organized <a href=\"https://unitedwedream.org/protect-daca-join-a-homeishere-action-on-nov-12/\">rallies</a> for Nov. 8 and 12 on the steps of the Supreme Court and nationwide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Department of Homeland Security, DACA recipients would lose authorization to work or complete their education. Besides the court case, UC leaders are working with Congress to create bipartisan legislation providing long-term legal protections for DACA recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Supreme Court does not disclose dates for its decisions, but a ruling must be made before the end of its yearly term in June 2020. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The California Public Employment Relations Board has already obtained “sufficient evidence” to call for a “formal complaint” against the UC, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to AFSCME, previously undisclosed documents reveal that the UC, in some instances, allegedly amended contracts in secret after establishing a “contractual relationship” with vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, “UC’s initial 2016 contract with Lyon’s Security at UC Office of the President’s UCPath Center in Riverside required the vendor to pay their contractors UC’s </span><a href=\"https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/fairwage/faq.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[$15 an hour]</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> minimum wage. UC amended the contract in 2018 to exempt Lyon’s Security from this requirement,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/22/workers-at-some-uc-campuses-say-they-dont-earn-fair-wages/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mercury News reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a UC Los Angeles food service worker — who logged over 106 hours in two weeks — was paid under two names to avoid receiving overtime pay; the employee’s base pay was $10.50 an hour, nearly five dollars below the UC’s minimum wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a 2017 California State Auditor’s report that was critical of the UC’s “flawed” and “ignored” policies surrounding outsourcing and competitive bidding, the UC allegedly amended its protocols “to require all University locations to either allow existing contracts to expire after 10 years or submit them to renewed competitive bidding,” the document read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After 10 years, then, if UC wished to contract out work for more time, UC is supposed to put out a Request for Proposals (RFP), notify AFSCME and justify to the Union why it seeks to outsource the work for the additional period of time,” the document continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the complaint alleged that the university instead granted itself “exemptions” from its own amended policies and extended its existing contracts in secret. This allegedly occurred in secret “at least 28 times” from 2009-2019 at UCLA, when the university added an extra 17 “patient care technical titles” to its contract with AMN Healthcare, a healthcare management service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSMCE also alleged that the UC has spent more money on outsourcing — which has increased by “as much as 52% since 2016” — and has poached union employees’ prospects for employment, opting to instead hire lower wage non-contract workers to do the same jobs, according to a separate press release from AFSCME. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In analyses published by State Legislative committees considering reforms to University contracting practices, UC said it spent just over $345 million in 2016 to outsource jobs normally performed by AFSCME 3299 represented UC employees,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In August of 2019, UC notified state legislators that it now spends $523 million on these same services—a growth rate in outsourcing that is roughly three times larger than its direct employment growth for the same jobs,” the press release continued.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When contract renewals are on the table, AFSCME said it is the UC’s duty to first determine whether “[the contract] exists to save money solely on the basis of the contractor’s lower wages and benefits, and if so, to bring that work back in house.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of approving such contracts, AFSCME said the UC allegedly goes about filling those positions secretly, leaving contract employees in a “contingent” status, which keeps them at arm’s length from the benefits and wages of full-time employment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allegedly occurred at UC San Francisco, where 62 contracted employees working for Allied Barton, a security service, applied for “career positions” at UCSF, according to the document. Only 11 positions were filled despite many Allied Barton employees “applying to open positions two or more times,” the document read. AFSCME alleged this is a result of UCSF’s decision to keep workers retained to a contingent status.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the recent complaints and strike announcement, Andrew Gordon, spokesperson for the UC Office of the President (UCOP), said in an email that the UC finds that “AFSCME leaders have shown little flexibility on their unreasonable wage demands,” even after announcing its sixth strike since negotiations began in spring 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME leader’s contracting claims and continual strike activity are attempts to gain leverage in negotiations. UC’s agreements with AFSCME protect employees from displacement due to contracting and no employee can be terminated as a result of a sub-contracting decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In fact, the number of AFSCME-represented employees has actually increased systemwide by double digits over the past five years. The number of service workers has grown 16.8 percent, while the number of patient care workers has jumped 27.9 percent,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to UCOP’s stance, AFSCME finds that the UC’s treatment of its employees warrants a reaction that goes beyond the bargaining table — “the picket lines.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is so troubling about UC’s continuing illegal conduct is that it’s becoming even more prevalent,” Kathryn Lybarger, AFSCME president, said. “These complaints detail UC’s continuing systematic and often secretive efforts to replace its own employees with lower wage contractors.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

introductions from each panelist with a description of the work they do. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall was hosted by the Office of the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA), which is led by executive Christian Ornelas; alongside a panel featuring a number of prominent local officials, several campus organizations tabled to advertise the local resources available for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the main portion of the town hall, students directed questions about basic needs — which encompass housing, food insecurity and money — to a panel of five members: Monique Limón, an assembly member representing Santa Barbara and Ventura; Salud Carbajal, a representative for Santa Barbara; Joan Hartmann, Santa Barbara county district supervisor; Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs and Mike Miller, vice chancellor for enrollment services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) General Manager Jonathan Abboud and Board Director Jay Freeman were in the audience, but there was no representation from I.V.’s local government on stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said his office did not initially plan to host a town hall this year — until a policy proposal from the Free SB campaign earlier this summer changed that. Following conversations with fellow Associated Students (A.S.) executives and input from Hartmann, Ornelas said his office got to work on the town hall event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall kicked off with brief introductions from each panelist and a description of the work they do at their respective levels to help alleviate the insecurities that are often associated with basic needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a political standpoint, Hartmann, Carbajal and Limón all stressed the importance of food assistance programs such as the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and its California branch, CalFresh, which aim to shed weight from the insecurities of food affordability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you have qualified for [SNAP and CalFresh], the benefits [can be] used at a grocery store, the food co-op, the farmer’s market and the food pantry,” Hartmann added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the university side, Klawunn and Miller highlighted various programs and resources UCSB offers to students in need. Voucher programs, which support housing and meals, for example, can be used by students during times of crisis to help get them through their next meal or next month’s rent, according to Miller, who chairs the Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Task Force at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we’re trying to do is get as much direct aid to students as we can around food and around housing,” Klawunn added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the panelists’ introductions, students lined up behind the microphone to speak directly to the panel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first question asked to the panel was about the responsibility of the government to support basic needs and its efforts to carry those responsibilities out.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every five years, the government passes what is called the Farm Bill. And a good, significant funding of the farm bill is the SNAP program … it’s absolutely imperative that we look out for those who are most vulnerable amongst us and that we work together to provide a safety net,” Carbajal said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conversation then turned to housing when an audience member asked about affordable housing for campus workers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn responded by talking about the proposed construction of additional housing on Ocean Road, where units would be offered for rent at more affordable prices, despite the “staggering” cost of living in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limón, a member of the Housing and Community Development committee at the State Assembly who said she has voted in favor of “167 different bills to advance housing,” believes there is no one solution to remediating the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Housing for “workers, for students, for staff, for anyone — it is a greater conversation and the state has really tried to make some investments,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As questions came in, one student asked the panel how Black students — one of the most underrepresented demographics at UCSB — would be supported through basic needs initiatives and remain “secure” in interactions with university law enforcement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann responded with an acknowledgement that “people of color have it much worse” in the context of basic needs. She moved on to highlight local law enforcement’s transparent approaches through new initiatives such as the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/foot-patrol-to-launch-restorative-justice-program-offering-alternative-punishment-for-ordinance-violators/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Foot Patrol Restorative Justice Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Party Registration Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn added that the UC Police Department’s new chief of police, James Brock, is taking a different approach to law enforcement by consulting students to “hear their voices” and better embed the police department in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a question directed to Miller, one student asked what the university can do better to spread awareness for resources offered on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller acknowledged that spreading awareness for campus resources is the university’s “number one problem” in the context of basic needs. He noted that many initiatives, such as the </span><a href=\"https://hacsb.org/section-8/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Housing Voucher program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have been difficult to advertise to students because the programs were recently created. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat this, he noted that the university works with student interns to spread awareness to the rest of the student body on a grassroots level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the town hall drew to a close, one final question regarding the role of citizenship in eligibility for resources was brought to the panel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limón cited Assembly Bill 540, an 18-year-old piece of legislation that “allowed high school students who graduated in California to enroll [in college in California] with in-state tuition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a different </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB540\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 540</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom this October, undocumented students will now have the opportunity to be eligible for certain grants and programs beginning next academic year, according to Limón.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, through UCSB’s incoming “meal plan scholarship,” Miller said the university is trying to establish “parallel programs” to CalFresh and SNAP by offering a campus alternative for undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure undocumented students are on a level playing field,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Carbajal took his turn to respond, he said that documentation and citizenship should not come before helping others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t want to live in a country where we look at each other and not think of our humanity,” he said, drawing the town hall to a close. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no tangible change that came directly from the town hall in regard to helping students with their basic needs, although politicians and university administrators were presented with a clearer picture of what problems are affecting students the most.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas isn’t entirely sure what his office plans to do following the town hall but is actively “thinking of ways to move forward.” He intends to hand over his office’s work on basic needs to the A.S. Lobby Corps co-chairs who “will be able to give a lot more time and focus to a basic needs campaign.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
