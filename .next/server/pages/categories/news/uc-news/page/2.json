And even as we transfer to online, there will be very few services where the door is closed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jenny’s letter echoed Ashlock and Armistead’s points, stating that “many of the costs that campus-based fees are intended to cover will continue.” Campus infrastructure, for example, will still require maintenance and upkeep with or without students, he said in the letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandatory charges, which include tuition, the student services fee, the nonresident supplemental tuition and professional degree supplemental tuition “will continue to help cover the faculty’s delivery of instruction, other educational costs, and the cost of student services,” Jenny said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some students have continued to express frustration that their respective UC campuses have not offered a reduction for certain campus fees that cannot be replaced by online services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yasamin Salari, a third-year political science major at UCSB, created a Change.org petition </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment?recruiter=840676071&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">urging the university to refund students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for services they would no longer have access to, such as “the transit system fee of $13.3, UCEN expansion fee of $20.2, events center fee of $12, recreation center fee of $70.04,” accordi</span>ng to the petition.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Although I understand these are extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances, I want to address and ensure that the education we are receiving is reflected in our tuition costs.

UCSD’s COLA movement took to Twitter, denouncing the university for not canceling the celebration, writing: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSD has an unhealthy obsession with Theodor Geisel AKA Dr. Seuss.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; outsourcing has been a point of contention between the UC and its unions in the past. In May 2019, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, the UC’s largest union, went on a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/afscme-announces-strike-over-outsourcing-unfair-labor-practices/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one-day strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over outsourcing concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the new guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new guidelines build upon the original UC Regents motion from November and hinge on the practice of insourcing, which is when “[outside] service contracts are terminated or not renewed, and the work is transferred to UC employees,” according to the guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered services — contracted labor typically performed by union employees — are at the center of the new guidelines. According to the guidelines, the UC hopes to insource “to the fullest extent possible” moving forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To determine if a covered service is eligible for insourcing, the guidelines say the UC must consider “equipment needed to perform the service,” “technical skills or expertise required to perform the service” and the “law, Federal requirement, contract or grant requirement, or court decisions or orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the guidelines say the UC must notify AFSCME when a UC campus is ready “to transition contracted covered service work.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the guidelines, only certain types of covered services can continue to be outsourced, namely when it is “required by law, Federal requirement, contract or grant requirement, or court decisions or orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC deems an outsourced covered service necessary, the guidelines mandate that UC employees cannot be displaced as a result and that “any proposed contract for Covered Services that would result in displacement must be canceled.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guidelines also explain how the UC will accommodate insourced covered service workers by providing them with the matching wages — $15 an hour or more — and benefits of university employees. According to the guidelines, the UC Systemwide Human Resources office will determine the wage and benefit parity on a yearly basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to covered service workers, the guidelines also explain how the UC should go about insourcing supplier employees, which are contractors employed by the UC to perform a specific type of work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To become insourced as a “UC career employee,” the guidelines say supplier employees must be eligible to work in the U.S., pass a background check and perform the same services at the same campus for 1,000 hours over a 12-month period or for “35% time over” a 36-month period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If AFSCME determines that a pending contract for covered services doesn’t comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the UC, the union has up to 14 calendar days to file a grievance with UCOP, according to the guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, the guidelines say UCOP has 10 days to respond to the grievance; if UCOP denies the grievance, AFSCME can file an “appeal to arbitration” within 10 days of receiving UCOP’s response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of an appeal, the guidelines say that an arbitrator will determine whether or not the UC’s pending contract for the covered service is appropriate. If it is appropriate, the contract will remain in place; if it isn’t, the contract must be terminated and the university must “stop the contracting process,” the guidelines read. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the form of a monthly stipend to alleviate high costs of housing since Fall Quarter 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike is known as a wildcat strike because it is not approved by United Auto Workers (UAW) 2865, the graduate students’ union.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the university did not meet the demands for a COLA of $1,412, hundreds of graduate students at UCSC voted in December to withhold over 12,000 undergraduate grades until the demands were met. When the graduate students went on a full strike last Monday, they refused to hold sections, grade or hold office hours in addition to continuing to withhold fall quarter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an open letter addressed to all faculty, staff and students, Napolitano said the contract between the university and UAW 2865 contains a “contractual promise” that its teaching assistants (TAs) would not strike while the contract was in effect, through June 30, 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the current contract allows for waived tuition, 3% annual wage increases, childcare subsidies, a one-time signing bonus and a remission of healthcare premiums. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The obligations between the University and its unions are negotiated and memorialized systemwide in collective bargaining agreements, which must be voted on and ratified by the union membership,” Napolitano wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling the wildcat strike “in direct violation of the existing collective bargaining agreement,” Napolitano said the UC would not re-open the union’s current contract nor would it agree to a COLA in addition to the current contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The TAs must honor their side of the bargain, just as the University must honor its commitments. The wildcat strike must come to an end,” Napolitano ended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer sent a separate email on the same day to all UCSC faculty, informing them that graduate students who did not submit grades from Fall Quarter 2019 would be dismissed from TA positions for Spring Quarter 2020. Kletzer wrote that graduate students had until Feb. 21 to “submit all missing grades, to end the strike and to fulfill their contractual obligations,” before facing consequences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those who do not submit full grade information by February 21 will not receive spring quarter appointments or will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments,” Kletzer wrote, calling it a “difficult next step that our campus must take.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her email, Kletzer also emphasized multiple times the “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">costs on students, particularly our undergraduate students,” that the strike was creating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She urged faculty members to “speak with [their] TAs and advisees and encourage them to stop their unsanctioned strike and to submit the missing grades.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer noted that UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive had proposed two new initiatives in an effort to end the strike: creating support packages for up to five years for doctoral students and two years for master’s students, alongside a $2,500 annual need-based housing stipend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous interview with the Nexus, Jane Komori, a doctoral student within the history of consciousness department and co-secretary of the UCSC Graduate Student Association (GSA), called the offers “insufficient,” and said they showed, to her, that the university “doesn’t take our demands seriously at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 15, UCSC’s GSA addressed Napolitano and Ketzler’s letters in an email to graduate students, telling the students not to submit their fall quarter grades before the GSA General Assembly meeting on Feb. 18, where they plan to discuss the termination threats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a decisive moment in our struggle,” the UCSC GSA wrote in the email, noting that this was the first communication the graduate students have received from Napolitano regarding the strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the email, over 200 graduate students had received warning letters from the university for failing to submit Fall Quarter 2019 grades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If hundreds of graduate student workers are terminated from employment, whole departments will be unable to offer courses next quarter, dozens of international graduate students will effectively face deportation, UCSC rankings will nosedive, huge sources of funding will be jeopardized, political organizing at other campuses will intensify, and UCSC may become subject to academic boycott (over 1,000 non-UCSC scholars and educators have already committed to a pledge of </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG2HqiSsC2XFFaT26e0YfGkRNo0LbIxQAiCxHoG12IlErlSw/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solidarity and non-cooperation with UCSC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">),” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In short, such a move would profoundly impoverish graduate and undergraduate education and research at UCSC, as well as its collaborations and partnerships with other research institutions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email also noted that a poll taken in mid-January found that 715 graduate students were in favor of withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our readiness to escalate is profoundly unsettling for UC leadership,” the email continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Union leadership at UCSB addressed Napolitano’s letter on Feb. 18 in an email to the UC Office of the President (UCOP), UCSC leadership and the COLA email groups at UCSC and UCSB. Sheila Kulkarni, the recording secretary of the UAW 2865 bargaining unit at UCSB, said in the email that termination of existing employment for spring quarter is a violation of </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/know-your-rights/contract/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Article 3 (Appointment Security), Section D</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the agreement, an Academic Student Employee (ASE) can only be removed from a position when the student has become “academically ineligible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The University has no standing to terminate ASEs who have been promised employment in spring quarter,” Kulkarni wrote in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To be clear, if you are a TA who has been promised an appointment for spring quarter in any way, formally or informally, verbally or in writing, this statement from President Napolitano is in clear violation of your union rights… We are more than happy to help file grievances on behalf of our colleagues at UC Santa Cruz.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC COLA movement is calling on graduate students at other schools to begin striking as well, UCSB graduate students discussed in their most recent COLA meeting on Thursday.

The protestors formed a large circle, sang, played instruments and gave a series of speeches in opposition to the housing project — while also providing a list of alternative spaces for the project that they believe would better suit the needs of the community. If built, the People’s Park development would provide 1,200 beds for undergraduate students and 75 to 125 permanent living spaces for houseless individuals.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Senate also recommended that the UC conduct additional research into other admissions avenues, such as going “test optional.”<em> Breana Lepe / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Senate also recommended that the UC conduct additional research into other admissions avenues, such as going “test optional” or using alternative standardized tests beyond the ACT and the SAT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Standardized Testing Task Force’s (STTF) report comes on the heels of a brewing debate as to whether or not universities should amend their policies to either forgo requiring standardized testing results altogether or to make submitting them optional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, prominent UC administrators, including UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ and UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive, supported the elimination of standardized testing after they deemed it a barrier for underserved students, the Los Angeles Times </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-23/uc-officials-recommend-dropping-sat-admission-requirement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point in time, the Academic Senate still supports the use of standardized testing, namely because it is unclear how altering the standardized testing policy will affect the admissions process as a whole, systemwide diversity and consistency among applicants, the task force said in its report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC — which receives the largest volume of SAT scores in the nation — were to alter its standardized testing requirements at this time, the report noted that “such a move could have significant, unanticipated, and undesirable effects” on students who plan to apply to a UC school in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the STTF report, the UC currently uses standardized tests for four purposes: to assess academic preparation and achievement, to use as markers for success beyond high school GPA, to establish eligibility and to aid in admitting students at individual campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But standardized testing is only one part of a 14-measure suite of admissions practices used by UC campuses, called a “comprehensive review,” according to the report. The “comprehensive review” encompasses students’ academics and backgrounds to factor in social disparities, the report said.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara and UC Riverside weigh students’ applications based on their standardized test scores before the “comprehensive review” stage. At UCSB, SAT and ACT scores comprise 20 to 25% of a students’ admission score, depending on major, according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At all other UC campuses, however, applications enter the “comprehensive review” stage without a weight assigned to their standardized test scores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Test scores are still weighted less than high school grades, and “admissions decisions are ultimately made based on a review of all the information available in the applicant’s file.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the predictive power of test scores, or how accurately the tests reflect eligibility, has increased in the past decade, the report found, while the predictive power of high school grades has decreased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also said that current standardized testing procedures may be a possible contributor to the underrepresentation of different groups at UC campuses. Almost 60% of California high school graduates are underrepresented minorities (URM), but only 37% of California resident students admitted to a UC school in 2019 were URMs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also acknowledged that the UC’s admissions procedures do not fully compensate for students’ racial and socioeconomic disparities, but found that “for any SAT score, students from disadvantaged groups have a higher probability of being admitted than students from advantaged groups.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to its recommendation to continue using standardized tests, the report also said the UC should steer clear of using the Smarter Balanced Assessment </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consortium </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(SBAC) in lieu of the current standardized tests, such as the ACT or SAT. The SBAC, which 11th grade California students take in high school, is aligned to a different set of academic standards and carries risks that are either not present or not as extreme in the ACT or SAT, according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The task force was deeply concerned with a wide range of risks related to the adoption of SBAC to meet UC admissions requirements, including (but not limited to) test security, item exposure control, and item bank size,” the report read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report will now move on to the UC’s entire Academic Senate for systemwide input. Then, the Academic Senate will forward its recommendation to UC President Janet Napolitano, who will make a recommendation to the UC Board of Regents to make a final decision in May. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299 (AFSCME 3299) patient care and service workers have been without a contract for just under two years — reaching an agreement with the UC is a “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">testament to our members’ commitment,” AFSCME President Kathryn Lybarger said in a press release sent out by the union. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This has been a long and hard process that required both sides to seek common ground and work in good faith,” Lybarger said. “But it has brought important issues to light about the growing problem of income inequality, the fight for what’s left of America’s middle class and how large public institutions can uplift the communities they serve.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC similarly welcomed an agreement with the union. The contracts were “achieved through the hard work and good faith efforts of the AFSCME and UC negotiating teams,” UC Board of Regents Chair John A. Pérez said in a press release sent out Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the contracts “provide hardworking UC employees with the benefits and protections they deserve, and it moves UC closer to being the kind of employer we need to be.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The terms of the contract for patient care workers include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 6% across the board increase plus an experience-based increase; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A one-time $500 payment to per diem and limited employees who worked at least 400 hours in 2019; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual 3% across-the-board increases between 2021 and 2024;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual 2% experience-based increases between 2020 and 2024; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A one-time payment of $3,000 for all eligible full-time employees; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second one-time payment of $1,000 for all eligible full-time employees in 2021; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A one-time payment of $1,000 for employees who have or will achieve 20 years of service for the UC while the contract is active. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contract, along with directing that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new employees receive the same pension benefits as current AFSCME-represented employees,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also continues to prohibit layoffs as “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a result of subcontracting decisions and creates career employment opportunities at UC by placing additional restrictions on UC’s ability to contract out service unit work.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The road to coming to an agreement was not smooth — AFSCME workers went on strike several times during the contract negotiations, most recently in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/ucs-largest-union-strikes-for-the-third-time-this-year/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">November 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over alleged unfair labor practices.
