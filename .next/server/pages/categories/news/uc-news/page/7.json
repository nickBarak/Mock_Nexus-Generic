According to the study, the university enrolled 82 percent more nonresidents from 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 while decreasing enrollment for resident students by about one percent in that same period.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the audit claims that the UC lowered its standards for nonresidents by admitting thousands of out-of-state students with lower grade-point averages, S.A.T. and A.C.T. scores than those of resident students.</p>\n<p>Assembly members called the hearing to examine if the University’s admissions and finance policies disadvantaged California residents applying to the UC in recent years. According to committee chair and District 52 Assemblymember Freddie Rodriguez, the UC’s policies have failed to put Californians first.</p>\n<p>“Sadly, we are here today with an audit report that confirms what many of us have speculated,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>District 64 Assemblymember Mike Gipson, who requested the audit in 2015, said he was “pissed” by the state auditor’s findings that the UC displaced resident students by increasing the number of non-resident students.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a slap in the face, not only of the members of the legislature, but also of the taxpayers of the state of California,” Gipson said. “The University has just done a very poor job.”</p>\n<p>UC Associate Vice President of Undergraduate Admissions Stephen Handel insisted, however, that the report is “incomplete” and that the University admits every eligible resident student.</p>\n<p>“The University makes an explicit guarantee to every family in California whose son or daughter applies to UC that we will find a place for them if they meet UC’s eligibility requirements,” Handel said. “It is a guarantee that we never extend to nonresidents.”</p>\n<p>UCSB <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/campus.profiles.2015.16.pdf\" rel=\"\">enrolled</a> 6,014 students in 2015, of those, 86 percent were California residents, seven percent were out-of-state and seven percent were international.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_yhhis0kzk8JIuVxN\" title=\"UCSB Nonresident Enrollment Gradually Increased from 2013 to 2015.\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?xTC\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am/yhhis0kzk8JIuVxN\" target=\"_blank\">UCSB Nonresident Enrollment Gradually Increased from 2013 to 2015.</a><br>\n <a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create pie charts</a></div>\n<p>The state audit report specifies UCSB among four other campuses that increased its nonresident target faster than the resident target. Nearly 20 percent of UCSB’s expenditures are funded by the state, and the freshman enrollment targets for the 2015-2016 year aimed for approximately 3,850 California students and 550 nonresidents.</p>\n<p>The different enrollment targets were created to fill each state-funded seat with a California student, according to Lisa Przekop, UCSB Director of Admissions.<br>\n “Non-residents never replace a seat funded by the state,” Przekop said in an email.</p>\n<p>The report also includes GPA breakdowns between resident and nonresident students for every school in the UC. UCSB displayed lower average GPAs for nonresident students between 2010-2011 and 2014-2015.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_Q08MW6ql9XhDCnQ3\" title=\"UCSB showed significant shifts in admitted resident and nonresident GPAs between 2009-10 and 2010-11.\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?cIO\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am/Q08MW6ql9XhDCnQ3\" target=\"_blank\">UCSB showed significant shifts in admitted resident and nonresident GPAs between 2009-10 and 2010-11.</a><br>\n<a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/bar-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=bar_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create bar charts</a></div>\n<p>According to Przekop, the “slight” differences in GPA can be attributed to inconsistencies in the ways different schools calculate GPAs across the world.<br>\nIn the Assembly hearing Wednesday, Handel said the GPA, S.A.T. and A.C.T. scores of the students admitted to the University do not completely qualify an eligible student.</p>\n<p>“Reader evaluations are based on a set of 14 academic factors that look well beyond traditional numeric markers of achievement,” Handel said. “A grade-point average and a test score, important as they are, provide only partial insight into the qualifications of students for college.”</p>\n<p>UC Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom further asserted that the state budget is what controls the enrollment of resident students, not the enrollment of nonresidents.</p>\n<p>“Growth in nonresident students does not constrain the Univeristy’s ability to enroll growing numbers of California resident students,” Brostrom said. “The key to enrollment is state funding.”</p>\n<p>District 16 Assemblymember Catharine Baker told the UC representatives at the meeting that they need to stop discounting the audit report as “unfounded” and start working with the legislators on a solution.</p>\n<p>“It’s very easy for all of us to come after you with pitchforks, and trust me, I’ve got one and constituents of mine have one,” Baker said. “Part of the solution is that you are not tone deaf. One of the worst things that can happen with a public servant is they get tone deaf. That’s what we’re hearing.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 7 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A vice chancellor at the school resigned in April 2015 amid allegations of sexual harassment, and <a href=\"http://www.dailycal.org/2016/03/10/berkeley-law-dean-resigns-amid-sexual-harassment-allegations-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier in March</a>, the dean of UC Berkeley’s School of Law resigned after a campus investigation found he had violated the university’s sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>“It was just time to say look, the sanctions need to match the seriousness of the behavior that’s substantiated,” Napolitano said in the radio interview. “We just don’t tolerate this kind of activity at the University of California, be it at Berkeley or be it at any other campus.”</p>\n<p>Under the new policy, sanctions imposed on administrators in these positions would need to be reviewed by the committee, which would then send its recommendation to the campus chancellor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As before the committee’s creation, Napolitano will have the final say as to how senior leaders are reprimanded.</span></p><div

(...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The University of California announced the new Presidential Public Service Fellowship on Feb. 18, encouraging undergraduate students to apply for public service internships through the UC Washington (UCDC) and the UC Center Sacramento (UCCS) programs.</p>\n<p>The fellowships will provide $2,500 in need-based financial aid to students of any major who are accepted into UCDC and UCCS. The two programs offer a full quarter or semester’s worth of academic credit for internships, coupled with a weekly seminar and other electives, with approximately 1,000 undergraduate students participating each year.</p>\n<p>Two UCDC participants and one UCCS participant from each UC undergraduate campus will be selected for the fellowships, which will be awarded based on financial need and commitment to civic engagement.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano praises the program for sponsoring a sense of citizenship in students.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to catalyze student interest in public service careers,” Napolitano said in a press release. “There are few callings that are as essential to a healthy democracy as a career in public service.”</p>\n<p>President Napolitano regards the chance to participate in public service as a crucial part of one’s professional life, as well as for the public good.</p>\n<p>“A public service internship can be a life-changing experience,” Napolitano said in a press release. “It can also be the start of a long and rewarding career that really makes a difference in the world.”</p>\n<p>Media Relations for UC Office of the President (UCOP) Kate Moser said the fellowship program benefits students by increasing their leadership skills.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to remove some of the financial constraints that prevent UC students from entering these programs,” Moser said. “This means that talented students from the UC system will be able to participate and become the public service leaders that we need.”</p>\n<p>Moser said students who are engaged in civic issues should apply for UCDC and UCCS because through the internships they could develop leadership skills in the fields of work they are interested in.</p>\n<p>“We need good leaders for our state and for our country, and UC students participating in these programs get good preparation for being strong leaders,” Moser said.</p>\n<p>Robert Kovacs, Fourth-year communication and political science double major, who is currently participating in the UCDC program, said the fellowship will help to relieve the financial stress associated with participating in the program.</p>\n<p>“The additional costs of the UCDC program can be over $2,000 compared to UCSB’s tuition, so it basically allows people to consider UCDC who wouldn’t have before,” Kovacs said. “I think $2,500 is the perfect amount, since it’s just enough to cover the extra cost of doing the program.”</p>\n<p>Chief Administrative Officer for UCCS Cindy Simmons said UCDC and UCCS train students to become California’s future leaders by providing real-world experiences.</p>\n<p>“UCCS really allows students to apply what they learned in the classroom,” Simmons said. “The Presidential Public Service Fellowship provides UC students with a great way to do something truly amazing during their undergraduate career, and gives them both an enriching academic experience through our UCCS classes, as well as phenomenal experiential experience through their internships.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A portion of S.A.G.E.’s revenue would go to financial aid for students under the UC system’s return-to-aid policy. At the meeting, UCSB students were able to ask questions and voice their opinions on the proposal.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSA’s work runs on membership dues collected by most campuses’ undergraduate and graduate or professional student associations, with supplemental support from the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and grants for program initiatives.</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major, discussed UCSA’s work. Mirza said he believes S.A.G.E. is a good solution to the financial challenges UCSA faces.</p>\n<p>“S.A.G.E. is just one of many solutions we can look at, but it is certainly a very viable one right now,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Sabo said the organization works to represent all UC students and connect with groups that have similar goals.</p>\n<p>“We represent all undergrads, grads and professional students before the legislature and legislator advocacy in front of the Regents and UC advocacy,” Sabo said “We do a lot of on-campus organizing connecting with different nonprofits or local groups that do a lot of work on the same issues that we do as well.”</p>\n<p>Sabo said the UCSA maintains close relations with California State University (CSU) and California Community College students.</p>\n<p>“We are a quarter of a million students. We work very closely with the CSU Students Association, which has about half a million students, and with the Community College Students Association, which has about two and a half million students,” Sabo said.</p>\n<p>Mirza said there are a number of campaigns UCSA runs every year, such as working to increase the number of student voters.</p>\n<p>“That is how we get people to listen to us and pay attention to what we are saying. So every year we register a significant amount of voters,” Mirza said. “Back in 2012 we registered over 50,000 voters, and that had a really big impact on the work we were doing.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, UCSA’s “Fund the UC” campaign aims to fight tuition hikes caused by budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“A big reason why you are paying more tuition is because funding for the University has been decreased over a significant period in the last 20 years, but beyond that ever since the recession we have seen huge budget cuts to our University,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Sabo said S.A.G.E. will promote the advocacy by and for UC students and increase students’ ability compete with large, well-funded and well-organized special interests in Sacramento. Sabo said UC-student advocacy is currently a “pay to play” system, something S.A.G.E. aims to fix.</p>\n<p>“You get to participate to the extent that you can pay for it, which is sort of counter intuitive to the UC’s mission, which is why we have started talking about S.A.G.E.,” Sabo said. “Unfortunately, tuition is going up and so we have to make sure that our voices are heard in that process too when it comes to the budget.”</p>\n<p>Sabo said UCSA hopes to get more UC students to Sacramento to testify and lobby lawmakers in order to prove their investment in state politics.</p>\n<p>“They look at students and they say ‘students don’t vote, they don’t come to visit, so I can continue to screw them over without any consequence, because I will just get re-elected to office because they have short-term memories,’” Sabo said.</p>\n<p>UCSA Communications Director Anaïs LaVoie said campus discussions like Thursday’s help UCSA gather valuable feedback regarding S.A.G.E.</p>\n<p>“We have been here four times now. We are really trying to talk to as many students as possible,” LaVoie said. “This is not a final proposal by any means. We are still developing it.”</p>\n<p>According to LaVoie, UCSA is working to make S.A.G.E. as transparent as possible.</p>\n<p>“Even if it is different on each campus, how can we make sure that every single student sees something that says, ‘hey, you are paying this to UCSA and you have the right to opt-out’ before they pay the fee?” LaVoie said.</p>\n<p>Third-year physics major Liam Stanton said he is skeptical students will choose to fund S.A.G.E. if given the option to opt out.</p>\n<p>“Guarantee you it isn’t just going to be five to eight percent of students who are going to say no,” Stanton said. “There are going to be a lot of students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/ucsa-leaders-host-forum-to-disucss-s-a-g-e-proposal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/ucsa-leaders-host-forum-to-disucss-s-a-g-e-proposal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/ucsa-leaders-host-forum-to-disucss-s-a-g-e-proposal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/ucsa-leaders-host-forum-to-disucss-s-a-g-e-proposal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/ucsa-leaders-host-forum-to-disucss-s-a-g-e-proposal/","id":3609,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[3608,3607,3606],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Victim of On-Campus Rape Files Lawsuit Against UC Regents","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?resize=980%2C555&ssl=1","description":"A lawsuit filed Tuesday on behalf of a UC Santa Barbara student who was violently raped by three men in 2014 alleges that UCSB is partially responsible for the assault because it neglected a “danger...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A lawsuit filed Tuesday on behalf of a UC Santa Barbara student who was violently raped by three men <span style=\"color: red;\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/sexual-assaults-reported-in-i-v/\" target=\"_blank\">in 2014</a></span> alleges that UCSB is partially responsible for the assault because it neglected a “dangerous” part of campus.</p>\n<p>Three men forcibly took the unnamed female student, who was 19 at the time, from Isla Vista late on Feb. 22, 2014 and raped and beat her for several hours until approximately 4 a.m. on Feb. 23.

The student also contracted herpes from one of the attackers and had to take preemptive anti-HIV medication, although the lawsuit does not say she contracted the virus.</p>\n<p>The student is requesting damages from the university for personal injury, negligence related to the premises of the university and both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

Oved and Ramirez explained the recruitment process for the 2017-18 Student Regent and discussed current UC student issues, such as affordability and accessibility of UC education.</p>\n<p>Oved said the University is addressing the issue of affordable housing for UC students.</p>\n<p>“The universities are now calling to implement the President’s new initiative to create 14,000 beds,” Oved said. “New, affordable beds by 2020, because there is such a huge, acute housing shortage across the UC system.”</p>\n<p>Oved said he plans to push UC campuses to support middle-class students with special scholarships.</p>\n<p>“I’m charging the universities to develop a system of the middle-class scholarship that currently exists at Berkley,” Oved said. “There also exists a similar one at Davis, but at every other campus, there [isn’t] any middle-class scholarships. My hope is that we can charge each campus to establish a baseline of support that is equitable across the system for middle-income students.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67643\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67643\" data-attachment-id=\"67643\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/student-regents-discuss-roles-recruitment/regents_by-lorenzo-basilio-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Regents_by Lorenzo Basilio-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67643\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regents_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-1024x684.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Student Regent-desginate Marcela Ramirez.

California’s postdoctoral scholars voted overwhelmingly to ratify a one-year agreement with the University between Oct. 19 and 27, ending long and sometimes tense negotiations between the UC postdoc union (UAW 5810) and the UC.</p>\n<p>The agreement, which instates yearly raises, increases health care coverage and loosens restrictions on international postdocs, was ratified by 98.8 percent of postdocs in a count of 3,471 to 42. Negotiations came down to the last hour on Oct. 1, with postdocs threatening to strike. After having to extend the previous contract to Oct. 9, the two sides reached a new one-year contract which the union ultimately ratified Oct. 27.</p>\n<p>The union, which represents more than 6,000 postdocs at all UC campuses, charged the University with “bad faith bargaining” and “refusing to provide the Union with information” necessary for negotiations in a document submitted Sept. 18 to California’s Public Employment Relations Board.</p>\n<p>Although the union never actually went on strike, president of the postdoc union Anke Schennink said she believes the threat of a strike led to concessions from UC negotiators who were “definitely aware” of the strike.</p>\n<p>“[The strike] was not mentioned at the bargaining table itself, but it came up in conversations in the hallway,” Schennink said. “We were willing to go on strike, and we were willing to prepare for that if the University hadn’t made any moves towards us.”</p>\n<p>Director of the UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program Mark Lawson said the agreement is an “accomplishment” for both sides.</p>\n<p>“I think it is important to look at the big picture and be happy that the UC and the postdoc representation are able to come to an agreement,” Lawson said in an email.</p>\n<p>The previous deal had run for three years, and Schennink said the new one-year contract means the union is already preparing for next year’s negotiations.</p>\n<p>“We have already started making plans and are already working on our strategy for next year,” Schennink said. “There is really no plan to relax.”</p>\n<p>The one-year time frame also allows the University and the union to get right to work on issues where there is common ground, according to Schennink.</p>\n<p>“We made some improvements and they are important, but there are also some other improvements that both sides wanted to see, definitely in terms of gender equity and childcare reimbursements,” Schennink said. “With a one-year contract, more post-docs will have more opportunity to participate and express their views and say what’s important.”</p>\n<p>Schennink said female postdocs face additional difficulties, referring to a UC Berkeley professor who was accused of kissing and groping female students against their will.</p>\n<p>“As a postdoc, you are in a lot of ways dependent on your professor,” Schennink said. “A professor in your postdoc can make or break your career.”</p>\n<p>In October, Schennink said members of the negotiating team “don’t respect postdocs.” When asked if that is still the case, she said the new contract would not immediately change that feeling.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that changes in a month or in a couple of months,” Schennink said. “I think this takes years, given how lengthy the process was for bargaining … and how ridiculous and absurd the University’s comments were.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara unit chair for the union and postdoctoral fellow in UCSB’s materials department Patrick Callahan said he voted for the deal and expected it to pass.</p>\n<p>“I did expect [the vote] to be about as overwhelming as it was,” Callahan said. “We didn’t really lose anything so I’m not really surprised.”</p>\n<p>Callahan said while other postdocs would benefit from the contract, his job would not change much, if at all.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we were really fighting for was protections for international postdocs, but I’m not an international postdoc so that doesn’t really affect me,” Callahan said. “I don’t expect things to change for me, but for other people I’m sure it will make some difference.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Halloweens, during which videos of rowdy street parties, car wrecks and police riots emerged on social media. UC Berkeley students and administrators attribute the rowdy crowds to both Halloween and the UC Berkeley vs. University of Southern California (USC) football game at Memorial Stadium on Saturday.</p>\n<p>With the absence of signature Halloween festivities in I.V., which were replaced by university-sponsored concerts and events and the emergence of Berkeley as a new hotspot, students are questioning if UCSB lives up to its status as a Halloween destination and its Princeton Review ranking of sixth best party school in the nation.</p>\n<p>Communications Manager for Student Affairs at UC Berkeley Adam Michael Ratliff said campus law enforcement is still investigating the cause of the parties and rioting.</p>\n<p>“Student Affairs leaders are planning to gather the facts about this weekend’s incident to better understand what occurred, who was involved,” Ratliff said in an email. “They will continue to work with all of our various student organizations to promote safe events for the Berkeley community.”</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley Police Department Lieutenant Marc DeCoulode said the presence of USC students at the football game and tailgating may have contributed to the rowdy crowds in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>“I think what contributed to it was that Halloween fell on a Saturday, which doesn’t happen really often and the fact that we had the USC football game so there was some extra people along fraternity row,” DeCoulode said. “Both some of our people and USC people [were] outside, so it was a little more crowded than usual.”</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley student and second-year environmental economics and public policy major Alyssa Nguyen said last year’s Halloween weekend ended early in the evening due to stricter law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“This year I think [police] were more lenient; this year it seems that the parties were shut down later than last year,” Nguyen said. “Last year, there were a lot of incidents of college student deaths in parties. The parties were dead silent at 10 p.m. to 11p.m., and all the parties were not big. It wasn’t like anything where everyone was allowed in and having fun.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said party-goers on Channing Way playing loud music and vandalizing cars were later constrained by Berkeley police department at the scene.</p>\n<p>“I heard that there was an individual’s party so crazy they brought it out to the streets. Everyone was jumping on a car, and dancing on the car,” Nguyen said. “Apparently a guy dressed up as Jesus was also dancing on the car and everyone was yelling ‘Jesus! Jesus!’ But the windows cracked and everything. The police pretty much blockaded everyone inside on the street.”</p>\n<p>Berkeley resident Nina Krishnan said the weekend was an outlier compared to what typically happens in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>“The last Halloween at Cal was on a Friday, and it was quite disappointing. I can definitely say compared to last year, there were far more people on the streets at Berkeley — especially Frat Row,” Krishnan said “More people, bigger crowds — it was lit. It was definitely lit on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Krishnan said she witnessed a street party that escalated into car vandalism and then chaotic running from the center of the party. Krishnan said she did not witness any police or security at the scene and didn’t know what motivated people to run.</p>\n<p>“It was more of a general party on the street at first. It wasn’t dangerous or violent — it wasn’t a riot — that’s not what I would call the first part. But then something snapped — in a flash, things got very messy as people started smashing cars and jumping on cars,” Krishnan said. “They definitely cracked the window and windshield and then in a few minutes, there was straight-out mayhem. People started running in all directions.”</p>\n<p>The unprecedented Halloween party scene in Berkeley drew a sharp contrast to the quieter-than-ever weekend in I.V.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Sheriff Department Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said based on low turnout this Halloween, UCSB students are beginning to realize the danger of inviting out-of-towners and having open-door policies for parties.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had huge crowds for Halloween especially, on a weekend. We were prepared for a large turnout; however, the last several years we’ve noticed a significant decrease every year in turnout for Halloween,” Hoover said. “The fact that there is heavy law enforcement, there was no music, parking was very strict and the students aren’t inviting out-of-towners — we are seeing it reflect in the number.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies and Chican@ studies double-major Carmen Mares said her freshman year Halloween weekend was surrounded by “negative vibes” due to many out-of-towner-induced safety concerns.</p>\n<p>“DP was filled with people. Everybody dressed up, some people getting a little too crazy. We’d walk a block, and in the next block, there are, like, cops having to get people on the sidewalk because they were too drunk,” Mares said. “It was intense because it was a playground for a lot of people to come.”</p>\n<p>Mares said she enjoyed her Halloween weekend this year because of the safety and the lack of worry over out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>“Halloween in I.V. was really exciting in the sense that we’re all dressed up, we all have fun and we don’t have to worry about school for a couple of days. Even if you’re not partying and you’re just walking down the streets in I.V., everybody’s just happy,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President and fourth-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian also said Halloween this year was significantly different from her freshman year.</p>\n<p>“The first year there was crazy amounts of people, and I think it is the last year before there was super enforcement of police,” Hashemian said. “[This year] there were more volunteers out there than actual people, which shows, like, how great of a job to keep this a local event.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Jorge Escobar said due to I.V.’s party reputation, many police and security resources are assigned to I.V. during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“Every UC sends a certain amount of allocation of cops to Santa Barbara because they know a certain percentage of their school population will come to Santa Barbara,” Escobar said “That’s why you would see things like ‘UCLA Campus Police’ here in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said she hopes I.V. can reduce police presence in the future if Halloween continues to be a local event.</p>\n<p>“I loved what happened, and I guess it’s one year but if it happens in four or five years, then it becomes a trend,” Hashemian said. “Hopefully we can spend less money on cops coming here and also changing the culture, which is what we really need.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said she noticed fewer out-of-towners and more community bonding despite heavy law enforcement within the area.</p>\n<p>“I was walking on Del Playa and I saw the police playing Frisbee with students; I saw students taking pictures with the police, chatting with the police,” Armistead said. “But you can tell they were from the area because they weren’t looking to trash the place, they were just looking to be with their community.”<br>\nAccording to Krishnan, this Halloween weekend doesn’t reflect the culture and reputation of UC Berkeley as a university and the community of Berkeley.</p>\n<p>“I personally don’t think you would go to Berkeley for the parties,” Krishnan said. “There are other things that were far more memorable at Berkeley than the parties, such as the food, culture [and] people. That’s the vibe you get from the city.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said this weekend doesn’t change or increase Berkeley’s party reputation because they typically experience the same amount of parties as other colleges in the nation.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we’re known to be work hard, play really hard. I think for [party] reputation, we don’t really have a matter of say in it,” Nguyen said. “I think for us we don’t care about the reputation — I have a feeling that it’s just Berkeley always has something going on every weekend where we really enjoy ourselves.”<br>\nHashemian said she is glad UCSB is losing its party school reputation.</p>\n<p>“It’s unfortunate that Berkeley had an insane [Halloween weekend], but insane as in having 3,000 people when, like, we have 16,000. I’m glad that we’re losing that reputation because it’s a reputation that doesn’t really represent us.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said UCSB’s party reputation is irrelevant compared to the university’s quality of education and on-campus diversity.</p>\n<p>“I think, ultimately, our reputation defines the quality of our degree,” Armistead said. “I think bringing Halloween down to a manageable fun time is the best thing for our community and education.”</p>\n<p>Mares said UCSB’s party reputation will not change just because this year’s Halloween was safer and more local.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it has that big of an impact in our SB party scene or reputation because people still party. It’s just for that specific event nobody wants that to happen. Nobody wants riots or [to feel] unsafe,” Mares said. “I think it was a community agreement — ‘Okay, we’re a party school — we party all the time. But hey, this is our school. A lot of the locals want to feel safe. We still party but we’ll party in a different way.’”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang said the university’s efforts to preserve I.V. have been effectual.</p>\n<p>“As evidenced by the calm Halloween weekend, our combined efforts are making a cultural change in Isla Vista and helping to create a surrounding community that complements the preeminent academic stature of our university,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 and 4 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66162\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66162\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/berkeley-draws-big-halloween-crowd/","id":3603,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[3602,3601,3600],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Postdocs Negotiate for Better Benefits, Rights","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.jpg?resize=512%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Just before their previous contract expired in October, University of California and the UC postdoctoral union (UAW 5810) reached a one-year agreement that union members will vote to approve next week...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Just before their previous contract expired in October, University of California and the UC postdoctoral union (UAW 5810) reached a one-year agreement that union members will vote to approve next week.</p>\n<p>With the union threatening to stage a UC-wide strike, negotiators from UC and the union were able to find common ground on issues that had eluded consensus in prior negotiations. UC agreed to yearly raises and improved healthcare benefits for all postdocs as well as expanded rights for international postdoctoral researchers. More than 6,000 postdocs throughout the 10 UC campuses will have the chance to vote from Oct. 19 to 27 on whether to approve or reject the contract.</p>\n<p>If approved, the agreement would also require the University to form a new Family-Friendly Committee to explore how to reimburse postdocs for childcare.<br>\nUnion president and former UC Davis postdoc Anke Schennink said the union was able to remove any salary reductions from the agreement in the last hour of negotiations.</p>\n<p>“The University had proposed a number of different wage cuts, and they would basically lower the take-home pay for postdocs,” Schennink said. “That was definitely a point that was talked about until the last moment.”</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, postdocs will receive yearly raises based on the National Institute of Health’s inflation index.</p>\n<p>The amount of University assistance offered to international postdocs had also been a sticking point in previous negotiations, but Schennink said the contract’s new terms on international postdocs is one of the “important improvements” over the previous contract.</p>\n<p>“For example, in case of the termination of a postdoc, the University will assist in helping the postdoc to get a travel visa to come back for a hearing if a postdoc has to leave the country because of this,” Schennink said.</p>\n<p>According to Schennink, the contract also expands postdocs’ healthcare coverage.</p>\n<p>“The plans will be at the same cost or slightly cheaper, but the new healthcare plan will be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, which is important basically for the reason that preventative care and contraception will be available with no co-pay,” Schennink said.</p>\n<p>Schennink said she thought the threat of postdocs authorizing a strike coerced the University to make some concessions.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think [the strike] has been important and that resulted in the improvements that we have now, but the University will not talk about that,” Schennink said.</p>\n<p>Schennink said in a previous Daily Nexus article titled “Postdoc Student Union Makes Case for Fair Pay, Job Security” that members of UC’s negotiating team “don’t respect postdocs.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s materials department postdoc and Santa Barbara unit chair for the union Patrick Callahan said postdocs do “all kinds of things,” including guiding graduate students through school and doing in-depth research.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, UCSB is a research university and postdocs are pretty important to getting high-level research done,” Callahan said. “They’re people who already have PhDs, so they are highly trained.”</p>\n<p>Postdoctoral researchers often work under the direction of a professor while training for a faculty position, according to analyst Billy Ko, who works in UCSB’s academic personnel department.</p>\n<p>“Postdocs typically spend five years getting training and mentorship with a faculty member,” Ko said.</p>\n<p>Callahan said because the terms included many improvements that he and other postdocs were pushing for, he expected a majority of postdocs to approve the contract.</p>\n<p>“Everyone I’ve talked to is happy that we’ve reached a tentative agreement … So I would imagine it’s going to be exactly the same, where the majority of the postdocs support the agreement that the bargaining team got for us,” Callahan said. “I have to imagine that a majority of postdocs will be voting to ratify the agreement.”</p>\n<p>Schennink said although the union accomplished many of its goals, members still have issues to address during next year’s negotiations.</p>\n<p>“We would definitely like to make further improvements in family-friendly benefits and gender equity in the University,” Schennink said. “There can be a lot of improvements there. That’s definitely something that will stay on the agenda for next year.”</p>\n<p>If the new agreement is ratified, it will be effective until Sept. 30, 2016.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

and the UConsent campaign at the monthly board meeting Sunday at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>UCSA is a UC-wide student advocacy organization governed by student officers made up of External Vice Presidents (EVP) from each UC campus’ undergraduate and graduate student governments and staff members. #HowAreYou is a mental health campaign voted on by UCSA Congress members in September 2015 aimed to improve accessibility and diversity of on-campus mental health services for students. The UConsent campaign is a UC-wide initiative proposed by UCSA in 2014 to support student survivors of sexual assault through education and advocacy.</p>\n<p>According to UCSA Undergraduate Chair and third-year sociology and education double-major and External Vice President (EVP) at UC Davis Sam Alavi, the board worked hard to solidify the rubric which will be used to evaluate on-campus mental health services. Alavi said the rubric will include total wait time to see a counselor, the total number of Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) counselors available and whether or not the C.A.P.S. building is accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“We figure out what is right and wrong with the mental health services, we give them a grade and then we give them solutions to have them improve their services and help raise their grade,” Alavi said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Mohsin Mirza said the meeting began with a discussion about what other campuses have done in conjunction with their C.A.P.S. centers.</p>\n<p>“We are beginning to quantify the data that we’ve gathered so that we can better advocate for the solutions that our students need,” said Mirza.</p>\n<p>According to Alavi, the UConsent campaign advocates for a diverse set of counselors who can relate and provide help to various students seeking help.</p>\n<p>“We want to make sure that these conversations are as intersectional as they can be and so the statistics are not whitewashed,” Alavi said. “Part of this is talking about how certain communities face more sexual assault than others and training staff members to work with students who are undocumented or transgender so that they can support their identities.”</p>\n<p>According to Alavi, students felt UCSA did not prioritize sexual assault enough, which motivated the board to create a plan for preventative education about sexual assault on college campuses. Alavi also said the board is pushing for UC Office of the President (UCOP) to host a peer-to-peer training symposium where students across the UC system come together to look at the best practices for consent training.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we’ve done is pressure the regents and president Napolitano to mandate sexual assault prevention education,” Alavi said. “We believe that if we can start having these conversations, we can prevent a lot of the sexual assaults that happen, instead of focusing on dealing with their aftermath.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he is hopeful of the accomplishments to come as the year progresses.</p>\n<p>“The level of dedication and planning that we have done these past board meetings makes me optimistic that we are going to make our students very proud,” Mirza said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65332\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65332\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/","id":3616,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[3615,3614,3613],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSA Meeting Addresses Student Debt, Improving Communication Between Students and Regents","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/UCSA.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/UCSA.png?resize=796%2C411&ssl=1","description":"The University of California Student Association (UCSA) held a board meeting to discuss several issues concerning UC students Saturday and Sunday at UC Riverside.

UCSA meets monthly, and in its October meeting discussed the goals of the Student Advocacy, Governance, and Engagement (S.A.G.E.) fee, Million Student March, developing the role of Student Advocate to the Regents (StARs) and communications with the UC Office of the President.</p>\n<p>S.A.G.E. is a proposal that would establish a UC-wide, voluntary opt-out fee of six dollars per student to fund UCSA and is set to be established at the upcoming November Regents meeting. The Million Student March is a movement that demands tuition-free public college, cancellation of all student debt and a minimum $15 wage for all campus workers which will take place at campuses across the nation Nov. 12. StARs are UC students who attend Board of Regents meetings held every other month to converse with regents and to present student concerns, and UCSA hopes to increase the presence and influence of StARs at the meetings.</p>\n<p>UCSA President and fourth-year peace and conflict studies major at UC Berkeley Kevin Sabo said UCSA is funded by student associations across the UC campuses, and for individual UC’s to receive the benefits of UCSA at the state level the associations must pay their membership dues. According to Sabo, the SAGE fee would better connect students and decision makers.</p>\n<p>“Really what S.A.G.E. does is there is a lot of difficulties with students being able to get access to decision makers,” Sabo said. “With S.A.G.E., the UCSA would be able to really eliminate that barrier of accessibility and get students before those decision makers.”</p>\n<p>Sabo said students who are interested in going to Sacramento to lobby may have troubles paying for transportation and other expenses. According to Sabo, S.A.G.E. will allow UCSA to “spend more effectively.”</p>\n<p>“They have to front the cost to participate and then wait several weeks, even months, to get reimbursed,” Sabo said. “S.A.G.E. is really about stabilizing the organization, giving a better, more predictable outlook on what revenues are going to be like so we can budget for things like taking students to lobby on things like student loan debt or the Perkins Loans.”</p>\n<p>UCSA campus action vice chair and UCSB fourth-year global studies major Dana Patterson said the Million Student March is a “unique opportunity” to address the growing problem of student debt in the United States. According to Patterson, tuition freezes are not enough.</p>\n<p>“Every person in our community is affected by student debt,” Patterson said. “Student debt is greater than credit card debt … It has tripled in the last 10 years … education needs to be free, mainstream, and make politicians talk about it.”</p>\n<p>According to Patterson, the board meeting was “100 percent a success,” and UCSA passed a resolution for the UCs to contribute to the efforts of the Million Student March on individual campuses. Patterson said she encourages students across the nation to participate in the Million Student March at their campus.</p>\n<p>“This is for every student to get involved, and I encourage any who wants to join this movement to come,” Patterson said.</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley graduate student Iman Sylvain said StARs are allowed to provide comments at UC Regents Board meetings and meet with Regents in private settings such as in break rooms or while getting lunch.</p>\n<p>“We have a wonderful program that gives students a back door access to the ability to really interface genuinely with the Regents, because they are kind of an elusive group,” Sylvain said.</p>\n<p>Sylvain said StARs representatives are able to advocate for issues relevant to UC students.</p>\n<p>“We’ve talked about student homelessness, we’ve talked about renewing the act for sexual assault prevention training for faculties, we also talked about mental health and the cost of living has been huge,” Sylvain said.</p>\n<p>According to Sylvain, UCSA is working on developing more personal relationships with Regents through StARs in order for the Regents to better understand the student perspective.</p>\n<p>“For example, the housing crisis — you can see that, you can see students sleeping in their cars or showering at the gym,” Sylvain said. “The Regents are very removed from the on-campus situation … So we are trying to engage [the Regents] in different ways.”</p>\n<p>According to Sylvain, UCSA is “only” scheduled to meet with the UC Office of the President three hours a year.</p>\n<p>“We are definitely pushing for the president to take more meetings and to have more ongoing conversations with them,” Sylvain said. “What are the ways to be in constant communication with the Office of the President?”</p>\n<p>Sylvain said UCSA advocates for a “genuine” shared government between administration, faculty and students.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t we have a vote — why don’t we have a say when it comes to decision making?” Sylvain said. “We want more than just our ‘foot in the door;’ we want a seat at the table.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCOP Inter...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) presented its 2015-16 budget at the monthly University of California Student Association (UCSA) meeting Saturday at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>UCOP Interim Executive Director for Budget and Director of State Government Relations at UC Berkeley Kieran John Flaherty presented the UCOP’s proposed 2015-16 budget and displayed connections between the California State budget and the UC budget. UCSA also reviewed the May Revise of the UCOP Budget Act of 2015, which froze tuition at current levels for a total of six years but allowed for mandatory tuition increases pegged to inflation after the six-year period.</p>\n<p>According to State Department of Finance data Flaherty presented, the primary source of state revenue is Personal Income Tax (P.I.T.), the secondary source is Sales and Use Tax (SUT) and additional revenue is from corporate tax. Flaherty said the P.I.T. has increased more than the SUT in recent years because California’s economy is largely based in universities and educational institutions rather than taxable services.</p>\n<p>“Nowadays … we don’t have a sales tax on services and our economy in California is very much a knowledge-based economy,” Flaherty said. “Good for us, because we are all in school.”</p>\n<p>According to Flaherty, the State now decides its budget in June, as opposed to January in previous years. Flaherty said this change benefits the state but poses a challenge to the UCs, as the universities must plan the yearly budget without knowing the State’s contribution.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge improvement now that the budget is settled in June because the fiscal year starts in July,” Flaherty said. “[It’s] still problematic for the University because in November we are set to approve our budget for the University, we accept students in the spring and we are not really sure how much funding we are going to receive from the State until after that.”</p>\n<p>Flaherty also said the relationship between the State and the UC is characterized by “volatility.”</p>\n<p>“It’s has been that way pretty much forever,” Flaherty said. “Agreements between UC and the administration in the past, called compacts or partnerships … are things that can’t bring stability and predictability to the UC state budget.”</p>\n<p>According to Flaherty, UC partnerships with the Governor are generally multi-year and extend beyond the one-year budgeting cycle that the Legislature appropriates for.</p>\n<p>“So a lot of state agencies — so labor unions for instance — a lot of businesses who have advocated for and received a tax benefit, for instance — they like to plan those over a multi-year basis,” Flaherty said.</p>\n<p>Flaherty said the State Legislature may oppose multi-year partnerships between the governor and the UC because their decision-making role is bypassed.</p>\n<p>“The Legislature is far less fond of these funding frameworks than administrations and the University,” Flaherty said. “The Legislature is basically left out of the process, yet they are asked to approve the funding for it without having had that much input.”</p>\n<p>According to Flaherty, the UC budget fell from 103 billion dollars to 87 billion within one fiscal year after the 2008 recession.</p>\n<p>“Less revenue resulted in cuts for almost all of the agencies … and all departments, and of course UC, CSU, the community colleges [and] K-12 were not exempt from those cuts by any stretch of the imagination,” Flaherty said.</p>\n<p>Flaherty also said the State proposed a 25 million dollar addition to the current UC budget year if the university projects enrollment of 5,000 more undergraduate students by next May.</p>\n<p>“The State is attempting to incentivize the University to really grow enrollment by a lot more than we anticipated,” Flaherty said. “Initially back in November … last year we were thinking of growing about 2,200 students, a lot of budgetary uncertainty at that time … so there was basically no growth of undergraduate students or marginal growth of undergraduate students.”</p>\n<p>Flaherty said he does not like the term “affordability” when discussing tuition because it is not the only factor in student expenses.</p>\n<p>“From a student’s perspective, affordability is a total cost of attendance,” Flaherty said. “It involves housing … it involves the reality of how much support some students provide to their families. It is not just tuition alone.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

and organizations across the UC to add a Student Regent Adviser position as part of his Shared Governance Initiative.</p>\n<p>Oved’s initiative aims to increase student representation on the UC Board of Regents through an appointed position, which would belong to a student from a different level of education than the elected student regent. Currently, Oved, an undergraduate student at UCLA, holds the only voting Student Regent position for the 2015-2016 term. UC Riverside graduate student Marcela Ramirez serves as the Student Regent-designate, a non-voting position, and will be the 2016-2017 Student Regent. If Oved successfully establishes the adviser position, he hopes to ultimately secure a new Student Regent voting position on the Board of Regents.</p>\n<p>According to Oved, UC students suffer a “lack of representation” on the Board of Regents, and he hopes to combat this underrepresentation with the new student position.</p>\n<p>“We’re 246,000 students with two seats and only one vote,” Oved said. “It’s ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>According to External Vice-President for Statewide Affairs, University of California Student Association (UCSA) Undergraduate Committee Chair and fourth-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza, the Regents fail to represent UC students with their decisions.</p>\n<p>“The UC Regents govern the University and unfortunately seem to be very out of touch with the issues facing students when making decisions that affect their lives,” Mirza said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Oved, past student Regents have pushed for another voting student board member and have not been successful. Oved said by first creating the adviser position, the Initiative will provide a foundation for the later establishment of a voting position.</p>\n<p>“It was really important for me to lay a framework and groundwork so we can really carry on the momentum that’s built every single year,” Oved said. “That’s why we crafted the Shared Governance Initiative, which is a multi-prong approach to increasing shared governance at the UC.”</p>\n<p>Last year, Oved served as the Student Regent-designate with Student Regent Sadia Saifuddin, a UC Berkeley undergraduate at the time. Oved said having two undergraduates representing all UC students was problematic when trying to address challenges unique to graduate and professional students.</p>\n<p>“As much as we studied about the issues of graduate students and professional students across the board, we still couldn’t really speak to the experience of a graduate student or a professional student, especially since they vary greatly from discipline to discipline,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>Oved said student governments on individual UC campuses change every year, and one goal of the initiative is to create a long-term plan that will keep momentum going for a new Student Regent position.</p>\n<p>“What we’re looking to do is try to defeat the leadership turnover and [ensure] that we have a long term plan that will make us effective at accomplishing,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Graduate Student Association External Vice President and UCSA Board Vice-Chair Yanira Rivas Pineda, the Regents often do not address issues pertaining to graduate students, a problem Oved’s Initiative could remedy.</p>\n<p>“Two years ago I remember talking with Avi about how important it is to have graduate students’ voices represented because our needs oftentimes go unheard,” Pineda said in an email. “Having two student Regents will ensure that we have more student representation and hopefully have an undergraduate and graduate representative.”</p>\n<p>According to Oved, tuition and financial aid policy discussions among the Board of Regents are often focused on undergraduates, but graduate and professional students face fee increases as well.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have as robust of a financial aid policy for our professional students as we do for undergrad students,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>According to Pineda, the most recent UC budget deal raises Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition for many professional students.</p>\n<p>“Many of us are no longer have access to traditional financial aid packages, like Cal grants, Federal grants, and subsidized student loans,” Pineda said in an email. “Many of us have families that we need to provide for as well and those of us who took out private student loans as undergrads are actually paying student loans while we’re in schools.”</p>\n<p>Oved said adding a new student adviser position will create change regarding problems that graduates and undergraduates both face, such as diversity, food security and tuition.</p>\n<p>“The Student Regent position has the access to key admin., to the Regents, to critical information and data that is otherwise not open to the general public,” Oved said. “They have ability to sustain long-term relationships and navigate the bureaucracy of the UC to really contribute meaningful change.”</p>\n<p>According to Pineda, graduate and professional students need UC-level representation to address challenges pertaining to issues such as mental health and financial stability.</p>\n<p>“A recent well-being report from UC Berkeley revealed that 47% of its PhDs and 37% of Master’s/Professional students score as depressed, so we know that mental health is an issue as well, on top of more specific graduate needs like student-advisor relationships, massive student loans and job security when we finish our program,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Oved, the UC Council of Presidents, both graduate and undergraduate, UCSA and Student Regent-designate Marcela Ramirez support the Initiative.</p>\n<p>“We’re starting to see a domino effect because now individual associations are passing resolutions in support of this item,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>Despite support from student organizations, Oved said he has faced opposition from the Board of Regents.</p>\n<p>“We are opposed because we have a fundamental disagreement about having more students at the table,” Oved said. “Some people use the excuse of not having enough space on the board. Some people say they don’t want to dilute the voting student Regent. Some people just disagree with the effect it will have on the board.”</p>\n<p>Despite opposition, Oved said he will keep working to implement the Initiative.</p>\n<p>“It’s my job now, with the collective effort of the students, to inform [the Regents] that this is no longer a question of whether we should do it or not,” Oved said. “It’s when we should do it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65298\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65298\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/","id":3613,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[3612,3611,3610],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":7,"route":"/categories/news/uc-news","highestPage":7}},"__N_SSG":true}
