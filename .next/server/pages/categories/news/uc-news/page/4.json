Leyva, who authored the bill, said in a </span><a href=\"https://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-10-04-bill-ensuring-timely-pay-uc-workers-approved-governor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effective Jan. 1, 2020, the bill mandates that the UC pay its nearly 140,000 employees on their regularly scheduled payday, or be paid in accordance with university policy if paid on a more frequent basis, according to Tom Hintze, a graduate student at UC Davis and member of UAW 2865.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite payment complications resulting from UCPath issues in the past, the UC never faced any wage theft penalties because it is a public sector institution, which doesn’t require employers to pay fines for each payroll violation, Hintze said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees under the umbrella of UCPath looking to file a claim with the payroll system were often forced to wait an unknown sum of weeks, and in some cases, months, to get their paycheck, Hintze said. SB 698, however, allots a five-day period for the payroll system to pay employees in full. Otherwise, employers will be subject to legal action through the Private Attorneys General Act, which enables workers to sue “in order to recoup their wages.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara first implemented UCPath in Fall Quarter 2018, but experienced shortfalls similar to other universities in the UC system when the UC Student Association released a list of demands to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsa-releases-demands-to-uc-regarding-ucpath-implementation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide restitution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for student workers affected by the payroll system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hintze said he began working for UAW 2865 in spring 2018 but didn’t take notice of UCPath’s “major problems” until May of 2018, when the payroll system was implemented at UC Merced and UC Riverside. Six months later, UCPath migrated to UCSB and UC Los Angeles, where there was “somewhere near a thousand people” who either weren’t paid on time, weren’t paid the right amount or lost benefits in the process, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students, especially those who often rely on a consistent pay schedule, have been bruised by UCPath’s inconsistent pay periods. In one instance at UCSB, an employee had their car repossessed as a result of “not being paid on time,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Berkeley, three employees were greeted with eviction notices after missing two months’ worth of pay due to the payroll system’s inability to accommodate for a shift in pay periods, according to Hintze. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath is expected to continue rolling out through 2020 at other universities such as UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis. Hintze stressed the timeliness of SB 698, which he hopes will help prevent a “major disaster like last year” when payroll issues arose from UCPath’s integration at other universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath’s migration across the UC system also marks a shift in payroll infrastructure. Hintze acknowledged that payroll problems predated UCPath’s arrival but said they were significantly easier to dispute because those former payroll centers were the respective campuses. Now, the UC has shifted the entire payroll system solely to UC Riverside, but the checks themselves don’t come from there; instead, according to Hintze, checks are “cut” and distributed from out of state, making it even harder to navigate the payroll process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While SB 698 will not repair any payroll damage incurred before it became law, Hintze said the UAW was successful in settling with the university to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compensate every employee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> affected by UCPath’s payroll errors last February. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each worker who was affected was eligible for $150 for each paycheck that [UCPath] had affected. So, the university paid out over $162,000 to student workers in damages,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The Secretary of State will review each campus’s program every year to ensure that they are following the guidelines as laid out in the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara is well-known for its consistently high voter turnout — during the November 2016 election, UCSB and Isla Vista voter registration drives registered a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/over-13000-voters-registered-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record 13,000 new voters.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meg Winnett ‘19, who served as the UCweVOTE coordinator for the external vice president of statewide affairs office during the 2018-2019school year, was part of the effort to register students and maintain that high voter turnout level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last year, I observed that the nonpartisan status of UCweVOTE encouraged many students to be more comfortable talking and registering with me and our volunteers. At the time, however, we were so keen on the act of registering students to vote that it’s possible we overlooked the importance of the next step: strictly nonpartisan voter education,” Winnett said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know Campus Dems and College Republicans, as well as CALPIRG, helped out tremendously with distributing materials to the student body at large, and I’m thrilled that there will now be another outlet through which students can find reliable information.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has been a leader in student voter registration for decades because students have crafted a culture of civic engagement that is second to none,” Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited to see the passage of AB 963 because I see it as a step towards taking the model for voter registration that we have at UCSB statewide.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano, who announced her decision at the UC Regents meeting at UC Los Angeles, took over as UC president after former President Mark Yudof resigned in 2013. She was the first woman to lead the 10-campus system and tackled several issues during her time in office, including legislation related to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in which the UC system </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-08/breaking-uc-files-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-for-unlawful-daca-repeal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sued the government on behalf of DACA recipients</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in September 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Napolitano received heavy criticism following the decision to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-18/regents-vote-to-increase-nonresident-tuition-by-762/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">raise nonresident tuition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and after the reveal of a </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-uc-audit-20170425-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">state audit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that found the president’s office was mismanaging money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also faced protests during her initial appointment due to her </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2013/07/21/napolitano-confirmation-draws-protests-six-arrests/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previous position</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the U.S. Secretary of Homeland security. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Wednesday’s meeting, she thanked her fellow Regents, particularly Chair John Pérez, for all of their help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe the university is on a solid path forward,” she said during the meeting. “Challenges, however, remain. With many new board members, with a new government and what will be seven years of service behind me, I think the university will benefit from some fresh blood.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a phone call afterward with media outlets, Napolitano addressed her accomplishments, pointing out that she’s held tuition flat every year except for one and saying the president’s office has made “substantial progress” in implementing the audit’s recommended changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Members of the board and members of the public can [now] track the dollars in and the dollars out of the Office of the President in a better way,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Napolitano officially steps down next August, she said she wants to focus on the same efforts she has dedicated the past year to: increasing the number of degrees awarded, closing graduate gaps, strengthening sexual assault and sexual harassment policies, increasing availability of student housing and moving forward with UC’s goal to be carbon neutral and 100% reliable on renewable energy by 2025. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was announced on Tuesday that the UC is pulling its money out of fossil fuels, </span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/university-of-california-system-divestment-fossil-fuels-886203/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divesting its $13.4 billion endowment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and $70 billion pension. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano denied in a phone call the claim that she was resigning due to health issues, explaining that she had gone through chemotherapy in 2016 and 2017 and is now cancer free. She reiterated that the average time for college presidents to serve is six years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After leaving her position, she will take a one-year sabbatical before resuming teaching at UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy in the fall of 2021. It is not known at this time exactly what classes or subject she will teach, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked if she would ever run for public office again, accept a cabinet-level position or accept a Supreme Court nomination, Napolitano said she has “no intention in those regards” but she would “never say never.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to Napolitano’s successor, Chair Pérez said he will soon release the names of those selected to handle the nationwide search for a new UC president. The search committee will include students, faculty and alumni representatives, among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pérez said the committee will be looking for a president who will help the university “maintain its role as the top public research university in the world and one that serves as the public mission the people of California have come to expect, and one that builds on the board’s commitment to expanding access and affordability.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Community Services District (I.V. CSD) directors voted unanimously to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9E_iYyJ9UF5lbtD0vLNb5y8X4qHc62x3Hb-xQ4J2n8/edit\">send a letter to the UCPD</a>, stating the district “supports a comprehensive independent investigation into these allegations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter further calls for UCPD to hold “a community meeting in order to hear from the public and community members who have been hurt by many of the disturbing allegations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday night’s discussion primarily centered on transparency regarding the allegations, with Board President Spencer Brandt stating he was “disgusted” when he read about the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an incredibly important issue that is very pertinent to us,” Brandt said, referring to the district’s partnerships and relationships with the UCPD Community Service Officers (CSOs) and the UCPD Interpersonal Violence Investigator position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is incredibly important for the public to know how their police department is operating… When allegations like this are made from law enforcement officers against their law enforcement agency and against each other, you just damage the trust that students and residents have for law enforcement. It damages the trust that everyone has with all law enforcement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Ethan Bertrand said he was “struck” by UCPD’s response to reports of the allegations, which he said “was their interim chief saying that ‘We must move past this as a community.’” Bertrand said UCPD first needs to address the concerns of the community before it can move on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree that we must move past this as a community, but I also believe that we can make that statement after there’s been an investigation and after they’ve engaged with the community,” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaders from sexual assault violence and harassment advocacy groups Standing Together Against Sexual Assault (STESA) and UCSB’s Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) also presented statements at the meeting which reflected their concerns and disappointment in the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsa Granados, executive director for STESA, spoke as a representative for the sexual assault advocacy group, stating that she fully supports the I.V. CSD’s letter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the allegations are true, I feel saddened and disappointed,” Granados said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados also made a point to acknowledge the work she believes UCPD has done well, while also calling out those who — “if the allegations are true” — were quiet about the misconduct in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sexual violence thrives on that silence… and I know UCPD has been working very hard to make inroads to ending sexual assault, so that cover-up, those allegations, we cannot tolerate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados added that UCPD needs to “work with our entire community to hold those involved accountable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three members from SASA – Emily Montalvo-Telford, Alya Ruiz and Sreya Subramanyan  — read aloud statements regarding the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the majority of those who spoke were from the community, only one police officer, I.V. Foot Patrol station commander Juan Camarena of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), spoke during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camarena assured the community that he “keeps his people accountable” and that police officers are there to serve the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just want to assure you that we’re here for you, that even though you feel that we have broken that trust, I want you guys to reach out to us. We are still here for you and anything that we could do to rebuild that trust, please let us know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the closing discussion, I.V. CSD Director Robert Geis stressed the implications of the allegations for the department if proven true. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The department cannot be silent on this. If it’s really happening in their department, then they have a really big issue to solve and really a tough process to go through to solve that issue.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [10:39 a.m.]: The name of the one of the speakers from SASA is </em><em>Alia Reynolds, not Alya Ruiz, as stated in a previous version of this article.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

her time, according to a statement released by UC President Janet Napolitano on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“We were extremely honored and fortunate to have Ellen serve on the UC Board of Regents where her expertise and passion for quality education… helped us navigate complex issues facing the university,” Napolitano said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Before sitting on the board, she held a seat in Congress, worked on Wall Street for 14 years and was one of the first female members of the New York Stock Exchange, according to the UC Regents website.</p>\n<p>While in Congress, Tauscher served in several subcommittees, including within the Strategic Forces Subcommittee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee.</p>\n<p>Tauscher also received her bachelor’s degree in early childhood development from Seton Hall University.</p>\n<p>Governor Gavin Newsom also released a statement on Tauscher’s passing, stating Tauscher “blazed trails in business and in the halls of Congress” and “held her own at some of the world’s toughest negotiating tables.”</p>\n<p>In their statements, both Gavin and Napolitano spoke about Tauscher’s “grace” during pressing times.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein described Tauscher as “brilliant, gracious and generous” in a statement she released after Tauscher’s death.</p>\n<p>“She had a knack for getting to the bottom of an issue smartly but also in ways that people could really understand. She truly loved her country and it was an honor to work with her,” Feinstein said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Tauscher joined the Board of Regents in June 2017 after being appointed by former California Governor Jerry Brown. She was one of 17 other appointed regents who sat on the board, in addition to Napolitano.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said the increase was vital, as the UC would have a $30 million hole in its funding without the hike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we are recommending… is a modest increase in non-resident student tuition, 2.6 percent. It’s basically a cost-of-living adjustment,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our primary purpose is to educate the next generation of Californians.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association (UCSA) has been the loudest voice against the tuition hike. UCSA President Caroline Siegel-Singh delivered a letter to state legislators on March 6, opposing both a non-resident student cap and the tuition hike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we discuss the importance of an affordable UC education, we cannot neglect that non-residents contribute a total of $120 million towards need-based financial aid through the UC grant and therefore support approximately 100,000 California residents,” the letter read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Sherry Lansing first proposed not voting on the issue, saying that she “came in with one point of view” and now felt conflicted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think there is so much more work to do on this. I think that we should hold off on this if possible and really talk to the legislature and really look at possible scholarships and how we handle this situation,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hadi Makarechian, chair of the Finance and Capital Strategies Committee, presented a recommendation from the committee to move forward with the $762 tuition increase, but said that there was opposition to the increase within the committee, including from himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several Regents voiced their concerns about the tuition hike, saying it would make the UC less of a “world-class institution” and accessible only to the very wealthy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Michael Cohen also pointed out that the increase would affect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) students who might be California residents but do not qualify for in-state tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When [students] get on campus, for me they’re all California students, and we have sort of a moral obligation to treat them the same way we would all of our other students,” he said about out-of-state students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent John A. Pérez said that until the Regents “reopen the discussion about pathways for financial aid for out-of-state students,” he could not support the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez also recommended “admission group cohort increases,” which would mean that when accepted, students would pay the listed rate at the time for the four years they attend a UC.

Since 2015, the UC system overall has accepted an additional 14,500 California undergraduates and aims to increase this in the coming years, as stated in the press release.</p>\n<p>“Part of UC’s mission is to do everything possible to help students reach their college dreams,” UC Regents Vice Chair John A. Perez added in the press release.</p>\n<p>“We continue to do so in a number of ways, including addressing the total cost of attendance, such as food and housing needs, and working to develop a multiyear strategic plan that not only supports students’ financial needs but also expands access to UC for more Californians.”</p>\n<p>Rising college costs, coupled with a growing movement calling for tuition-free colleges, have made tuition hikes increasingly controversial as the Regents discuss it each year. Students groups typically attend Regents meetings to argue against the hikes.</p>\n<p>Last year, the UC Regents voted to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-07-19/uc-regents-vote-to-decrease-tuition-by-60/\">lower</a> in-state tuition by $60 – a result from eliminating legal fees – and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\">raised</a> out-of-state tuition tuition by 3.5 percent.</p>\n<p>As of Fall Quarter 2018, out-of-state students compose approximately 21 percent, or over 58,500 students, of the UC system. In 2017, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/regents-approve-nonresident-enrollment-cap/\">voted</a> to limit the number of out-of-state students allowed at each UC to 18 percent.</p>\n<p>The non resident numbers include both students from other states within the U.S. as well as international students.</p>\n<p>As of the 2018-2019 school year, <a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/cost-of-attendance\">the cost of attending UCSB</a> as an in-state undergraduate who lives in an on-campus residence hall amounts to approximately $36,798; for an in-state undergraduate who lives off campus, this number drops to $33,768.</p>\n<p>Those numbers increase for nonresident students.</p>\n<p>However, according to the press release, about 57 percent of current California undergraduates pay no tuition, and an additional 20 percent have part of the costs covered by financial aid programs.</p>\n<p>The Regents will vote on whether or not to raise out-of-state tuition for the 2019-2020 during its upcoming meeting this week.

photo)</em></p></div>\n<p>“UC already has clear policies and procedures in place that protect anyone’s right to peacefully protest or speak on our campuses.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, March 2, President Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he discussed the executive order.</p>\n<p>“I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars,” President Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference.</p>\n<p>“Everyday we’re restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all. We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right and we believe in religious liberty,” he added.</p>\n<p>The University of California Office of the President’s (UCOP) statement cited the UC as being the home of the free speech movement in the 1960s, along with the fact that UC campuses have hosted conservative speakers including Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager and Dinesh D’Souza.</p>\n<p>The UC has also established a National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement, which is “dedicated to exploring issues and challenges related to free expression through research, advocacy, debate and discussion,” according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The statement also referred to an incident when a representative of a conservative group was assaulted at UC Berkeley, adding that “the university acted swiftly.”</p>\n<p>“The campus released a statement strongly condemning the incident and expressing support for the police department’s efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice,” the statement said. “Chancellor Carol Christ also sent a campus-wide message reaffirming UC Berkeley’s commitment to freedom of expression.”</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano said the UC does not need the federal government to mandate free speech on college campuses, as it is already mandated.</p>\n<p>“Free speech is a fundamental value of the University of California and we already have strong policies in place that protect the free expression of ideas, regardless of political persuasion,” Napolitano said. “Protecting free expression has been part of the University of California’s DNA for decades.”</p>\n<p>College Republicans President Leslie Garcia, however, has differing views.</p>\n<p>Garcia said that Trump’s proposed executive order is an “incredible idea.”</p>\n<p>Garcia, a fourth-year political science and middle east studies double major, added that in the time she’s been at UCSB, “college conservatives have seen how far campus administrators and more left-leaning people are willing to go to shut down the discourse.”</p>\n<p>Garcia referenced when Ben Shapiro came to UCSB, and said that although there was a “leftist outcry” against Ben Shapiro, “the event was still funded and successful.”</p>\n<p>However, UC Berkeley had not been so lucky due to leftist groups enacting violence in a quest to shut down free speech, she added.</p>\n<p>Although President Trump spoke of his intent to issue the executive order, it is unclear when he will officially issue the executive order.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

California Dream as a house we are building together,” Newsom said in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/01/10/governor-newsom-proposes-2019-20-california-for-all-state-budget/\">press release</a>. “That wasn’t just a speech device – it’s exactly what we are proposing today. To make the California Dream available to all, our state must be fiscally sound.”</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Board of Regents were quick to praise Newsom’s budget, calling it a “welcome step and a solid down payment” for the UC system.</p>\n<p>“These funds help further the academic mission of the university, from student success to classroom upgrades, financial aid to timely graduations,” UCOP and the Regents said in joint statement released soon after the budget plan was announced.</p>\n<p>Gov. Newsom’s funds for the UC are mainly split into three parts: $240 million toward an ongoing general fund, $138 million as one-time payment and $15 million to increase degree completion and programs at UC extension centers, according to the budget.</p>\n<p>The ongoing general fund will fund finance operating costs, efforts to increase student success, improving student mental health services and helping to address homelessness and student hunger; the one-time fund will address the UC’s deferred maintenance backlog.</p>\n<p>“These investments are provided with the expectation that tuition will remain flat, access will be increased, and time to degree will improve,” the budget states.</p>\n<p>This $400 million is <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/brown-signs-budget-act-of-2018-increases-funding-to-uc/\">an increase</a> from the $346 million that former Gov. Brown allocated in the Budget Act of 2018.</p>\n<p>Newsom’s budget took into account the UC’s “significant growth” over the past decade. Enrollment for the UC system rose from about 230,000 students in 2010 compared to 270,000 for fall 2017, a 19.2 percent increase, according to the budget.</p>\n<p>For UC Santa Barbara, this was 22,000 in 2010 to approximately 25,000 students for Fall 2017.</p>\n<p>Within the $400 million allotted, there is also a designated $5.3 million toward mental health services – with the goal of allowing campuses to hire additional clinicians –– and $15 million toward addressing student hunger and housing needs.</p>\n<p>Approximately $1.3 million for an immigration legal services program is also designated, to begin in 2022-23.</p>\n<p>The budget also included a $1 million fund toward supporting UC Davis’ Firearms Violence Research Center, beginning in 2021-22.</p>\n<p>Newsom will not sign the budget until June, after the California legislature has voted on it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Jan. 7, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence and Sofia Mejias-Pascoe can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

student regent-designate — both of which are currently held by UC graduate students, Huang said in an email sent out to all UC student newspapers.</p>\n<p>“Eliminating the Student Advisor position strips away essential student representation at the highest level of UC governance and rejects years of hard-fought work to bring the student voice into university governance,” Huang said in the email.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/regents.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2132214360\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85424\">letter sent to the Regents</a>, Regent Richard Sherman recommended the position be eliminated because of the existence of other opportunities for student representation on the board, such as the positions of Student Advocates to the Regents and Student Observers to Standing Committees.</p>\n<p>If the Regents vote to remove the position, there will no longer be an undergraduate student representative serving on the board after Huang’s term ends in June 2019.</p>\n<p>The intended goal of the Student Advisor position was to provide insight on the issues and concerns of the student populations not represented by the Student Regent, according to Sherman’s letter.</p>\n<p>Student Regent Devon Graves recommended the removal of the position, Huang said.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Student-Regent-Graves-Statement-Re-Student-Advisor-Pilot-Program.pdf\">separate press release</a>, Graves said he made the recommendation on the basis of student perspectives from UCSA, UC Graduate and Professional Council (UCGPC) and Council of Presidents, which reflected that other programs are more effective in representing student voices than the Student Advisor position.</p>\n<p>He also said he wants to support “other opportunities to ensure a diversity of student perspectives” while transitioning out of the student advisor position.</p>\n<p>UC Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/regents-to-vote-on-student-advisor-proposal/\">originally voted</a> on the creation of the position in 2016 after it was proposed by Avi Oved, the student regent and a UC Los Angeles student at the time.</p>\n<p>The Board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/regents-approve-student-advisor-position-for-trial-period/\">passed the proposal</a> unanimously and agreed to a two-year trial for the position, at the end of which the Regents would assess the effectiveness of the position.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 29]: Huang later recanted his statement about UCSA. UCSA does not support the removal of the position.

Commons</em></p></div>\n<p>“[The changes will] unravel critical protections for individuals who experience sexual harassment, and undermine the very procedures designed to ensure fairness and justice,” Taylor said in the press release.</p>\n<p>Title IX is the federal civil rights law which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities that receive federal funding.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education released an extensive report of <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf\">proposed Title IX amendments</a> on Nov. 16.</p>\n<p>These amendments would narrow the definition of sexual harassment under Title IX policy, limit investigations to “formal” complaints and require live hearings for cases of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education has authorized a 60 day period of public comment regarding the proposal.</p>\n<p>U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who spearheaded the guidelines change, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-proposed-title-ix-rule-provides-clarity-schools-support-survivors-and-due-process-rights-all\">said the amendments were made</a> with both the survivor and accused student in mind.</p>\n<p>“My focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment,” DeVos said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on.”</p>\n<p>The Title IX amendments would rework the definition of sexual assault, changing it from “incidents that limit a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the educational programs” to “conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school’s education program or activity,” according to the proposal.</p>\n<p>This redefinition would limit what is legally considered sexual harassment, thus invalidating the experiences of many victims, Taylor said.</p>\n<p>“Narrowing the scope of what constitutes sexual harassment risks leaving serious misconduct unaddressed,” she said in the press release.</p>\n<p>The Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which enforces civil rights laws in programs that receive federal assistance, has used an appropriate definition of sexual harassment in the past, according to Taylor.</p>\n<p>Changes to this definition would not only create “new and unnecessary hurdles” for survivors but also create obstacles for OCR’s enforcement of Title IX.</p>\n<p>“The proposed rules significantly weaken the OCR’s authority to enforce Title IX. In stark contrast to its current enforcement powers, OCR would not require changes to a school’s process unless it determines the school is ‘deliberately indifferent,’ an incredibly high standard,” Taylor said in her statement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the proposed regulations would require live hearings for sexual assault allegations. These live hearings would allow for the cross-examination of plaintiffs through the parties’ advisors, according to the amendments report.</p>\n<p>Taylor expressed doubt that alterations to Title IX policy would improve the legal proceedings following incidents of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The rules are prescriptive… the proposed hearings would allow representatives of alleged assailants to directly cross-examine complainants, which is wholly unnecessary and inherently intimidating, especially to students making the already difficult decision to come forward,” Taylor said.</p>\n<p>Taylor is adamant about the UC’s stance against the proposed regulations, calling the amendments “ill-advised attempts to erode important Title IX protections for all members of the community.”</p>\n<p>“UC remains steadfast in its commitment to combating sexual violence through prevention, transparent and fair resolution processes, and just outcomes,” she said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“The university will continue to ensure its policies and procedures protect the rights and well-being of all parties in the process.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
