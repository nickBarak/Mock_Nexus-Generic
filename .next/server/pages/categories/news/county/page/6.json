It will produce a net total of approximately $740,000 per year, according to Spencer Brandt, I.V. Community Service District (CSD) board secretary.</p>\n<p>This was the CSD’s second attempt to secure consistent funding following the failure of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\">Measure F</a> in 2016, which left the CSD without a primary source of funding.</p>\n<p>The “Yes on Measure R 2018” campaign – spearheaded by Brandt, CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud, CSD President Ethan Bertrand and UC Santa Barbara Campus Democrats outgoing President Emily Murray – has been promoting the measure since the end of UCSB’s Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“Throughout this whole process, we’ve organized a group of passionate community volunteers to speak with residents about the issues that matter to them,” Bertrand said. “We knocked on every door in Isla Vista at least three times, some doors we hit up to six times.”</p>\n<p>Most I.V. residents will pay the tax, but Brandt said the CSD is currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75 percent vs. 17.25 percent.</p>\n<p>Approximately 23,000 people live in I.V. as of the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217#qf-flag-X\">most recently conducted</a> census in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>Initial results from the Vote By Mail and Mailed Ballot Results reported 56.34 percent yes votes and 43.66 percent no votes on the measure.</p>\n<p>However, these numbers jumped to 71.04 percent yes votes and 23.64 percent no votes once votes from the first precincts came in. The percentage of yes votes rose throughout the night from there, while the percentage of no votes steadily decreased.</p>\n<p>“We were sort of cautiously optimistic, but when that first polling station came in, and we were up, that was just insane,” Brandt said. “I don’t think any of us believed it…I was crying, I think a lot of us were.”</p>\n<p>Murray, a second-year history and public policy major, shared Brandt’s sentiments.</p>\n<p>“I walked up to Rincon, and Spencer ran out and said, ‘We did it!’” Murray said. “I was overjoyed…when we found out we won by a lot, that was amazing.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is the CSD’s second attempt to secure funding. <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Throughout the course of the campaign, the pro-Measure R group <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/how-much-are-pro-anti-measure-r-groups-spending-for-your-vote/\">raised</a> $35,630.25 and spent $7,107.67 as of May 19, according to <a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByFilerName.aspx\">campaign filings</a> with the Santa Barbara County.

Community Resource Building, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“I’m just elated and so excited for the good work that we can do for the people of Isla Vista, from opening the community center to improving public safety to continuing to work on tenant-landlord issues,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

He began his career in law enforcement in the Bay Area, later transferring to Inglewood and becoming a police chief for Moscow, Idaho, where he oversaw the city and the University of Idaho. He was also the chief of police for the City of Lompoc in 1995.</li>\n<li>Lt. Hsueh has worked in SBSO for 31 years. He’s led initiatives to provide officers trainings on responding to people with mental illness and trained over 700 officers in two years. Hsueh said he wants to improve training to teach officers to use less force and implement more crisis de-escalation training.</li>\n<li>Lt. Olmstead has worked in SBSO for 28 years and has worked in every division in the department, including the narcotics and human trafficking units. He is running on a platform of repairing relationships with the county board of supervisors.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_83337\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1473520250\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83342\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83337\" data-attachment-id=\"83337\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/sheriff-7254/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sheriff-7254\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83337\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83337\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left to right, sheriff-coroner candidates incumbent Sheriff Bill Brown, Lt.

Brian Olmstead discuss police-resident relations and sexual assault policies in Isla Vista. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Responding to Cases of Sexual Assault in I.V.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said officers should treat survivors with dignity and compassion, as if they were members of their own family. The department does not have a single rape kit that has not been processed, Brown said.</li>\n<li>Hsueh said SBSO could benefit from referring victims to both Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, formerly the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, and UCSB’s Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education, as well as implementing green dot and implicit bias training. Green dot training teaches people to be an active bystander in preventing sexual assault.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said he believes law enforcement could provide more education to the public about where victims can report sexual assault cases, as jurisdictional issues can be confusing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Police-Resident Relations During Large Events in I.V. </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said future large events in I.V. such as Deltopia should only be for local community members because the majority of crime and citations during these events are linked to people from out of town.</li>\n<li>Hsueh suggested SBSO work with the CSD to create sanctioned events that minimize crime through crisis stabilization units and through triaging those suffering from alcohol and drug abuse. Hsueh has been on the “front lines” of riots and said police often did not act in accordance with their training because they did not give ample notice before using their weapons.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said more alcohol-free daytime events could decrease the rates of crime and medical transports because alcohol is a main source of problems during I.V. events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All three candidates unanimously expressed support for medical amnesty for overdose victims and those suffering from alcohol and substance abuse.</p>\n<p>Hsueh, in particular, expressed support for written policies that would show the public that the department’s emphasis is to protect their lives. Under these new policies, those seeking medical attention for illegal activities like drug use or underage drinking would not be arrested.</p>\n<p><strong>Candidates’ Perspective on I.C.E. Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown, who has previously complied with I.C.E.’s requests, said he would continue to comply with requests to give the agency the release dates of violent criminals.</li>\n<li>Hsueh was the only of three candidates to state that he would stop complying with I.C.E.’s orders, which he said was necessary to improve “public trust.”</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the immigration system currently needs “comprehensive reform” but said the department needs to follow the law and focus on removing violent people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Concerns Over SBSO Lack of Personnel</strong></p>\n<p>The three candidates said one of the department’s pressing needs is its lack of personnel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said the department has lost approximately 90 positions funded through the county’s general fund since 2008. He said the department has cut programs in non-emergency areas and lost several specialized units and crime prevention programs, but he hopes to bring back those programs incrementally.</li>\n<li>Hsueh agreed with Brown’s position.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the county has paid $4.5 million in overtime as a result of vacancies.

id=\"caption-attachment-83266\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara Congressman Salud Carbajal signed a bipartisan discharge petition last Friday in an attempt to force the U.S. House of Representatives to vote on bills that would protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients.</p>\n<p>“Obviously this is a long overdue vote that’s needed, and it’s forcing the leadership to have to bring this legislation forward,” Carbajal said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"_5yl5\">Carbajal said the goal of the discharge petition is to have a bipartisan bill that provides DACA recipients with the same benefits that they have received under the DACA program.</span></p>\n<p>The petition was first proposed by Florida Congressman Carlos Curbelo in mid-May.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, 205 members of Congress have signed the petition, according to the <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0010.xml\">Clerk of the House of Representatives</a>. Overall, 218 congressmen and congresswomen must sign the petition for it to be considered.</p>\n<p>If enough members of Congress sign the petition, the document will force a vote in the House on several bills, according to Carbajal.</p>\n<p>The bill which receives the most votes in House of Representatives will be adopted under a “queen-of-the-hill” procedure, which is a special method members of Congress can use to allow a series of bills to be voted on, according to <a href=\"https://valadao.house.gov/uploadedfiles/congressional_research_service_queen_of_the_hill_rules.pdf\">the Congressional Research Service</a>.</p>\n<p>The bill that then receives the most votes will pass the House.</p>\n<p>House members can propose discharge petitions when a bill has been introduced and referred to a committee for 30 or more legislative days, according to the House of Representatives rules.</p>\n<p>Carbajal believes legislation to protect DACA recipients would pass “overwhelmingly” if it was voted on in the House, according to a press release sent out by Carbajal’s office.</p>\n<p>“There are many good bipartisan proposals to ensure that the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients who have grown up in this country, gone to school, and paid their taxes are allowed to continue living and working in the only home they’ve known,” Carbajal said in the press release.</p>\n<p>Should the discharge petition gain the required number of signatures, the four bills likely under consideration are the Securing America’s Future Act of 2018, the D.R.E.A.M. Act of 2017, the Uniting and Securing America (USA) Act of 2018 and a bill that House Speaker Paul Ryan will propose, according to Carbajal’s office.</p>\n<p>It is currently unclear what Ryan will propose, according to Carbajal’s office.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4760\">The Securing America’s Future Act of 2018</a>, introduced by Congressman Robert Goodlatte of Virginia, would provide current DACA recipients a renewable legal status but would also decrease national immigration levels and authorize construction of a border wall, according to <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/011018-Securing-Americas-Future-Act-Final.pdf\">the House Judiciary Committee</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3440\">The D.R.E.A.M. Act of 2017</a> would provide lawful permanent residence status to DACA recipients and others meeting certain conditions and provide a path to citizenship for eligible individuals, according to a press release from Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, one of its sponsors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4796\">The USA Act of 2018</a> would also provide lawful permanent residence status to DACA recipients and other eligible persons. It has additional provisions as well, including increasing the number of immigration judges, according to a press release from Congressman William Hurd’s office.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said he is “very hopeful” that the discharge petition will gather enough signatures.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 24, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hayley Tice</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hayley Tice serves as data editor for the 2020-21 school year.

Tamari Dzotsenidze, a second-year political science major, also ran for the position.</p>\n<p>“[Washington] has a passion for the things we do here,” said Carlos López, vice chair of the IVRPD board.</p>\n<p>The board position has been vacant since former member Daniel Torres stepped down on March 8 because he could not maintain consistent residency in I.V., López said.</p>\n<p>The application process consisted of a written application and interview conducted at the meeting. Current board members and members of the audience asked the candidates about their goals for the IVRPD and interests within the community.</p>\n<p>Washington has volunteered with the I.V. Elementary School and for the Measure O campaign, which in May 2017 secured a special tax that now funds additional parks services in I.V.</p>\n<p>The newly appointed board member said she is particularly interested in the I.V. Youth Center and engaging with the younger population in the community.</p>\n<p>“To a certain extent [UC Santa Barbara] students can dominate the community,” Washington said, noting the importance of keeping children a part of the conversation when discussing the needs of the I.V. population.</p>\n<p>During her time on the board, Washington said she plans to work toward creating more playgrounds for children, as well as organizing an assembly at I.V. Elementary School to talk with students about their thoughts on I.V. parks.</p>\n<p>After being appointed, Washington joined the other four board members — López, Jacob Lebell, Pegeen Soutar and Matias Eusterbrock — for the remainder of the meeting.</p>\n<p>The board voted to endorse Measure R, a ballot measure that would fund the I.V. Community Services District by imposing an eight percent tax on electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services.</p>\n<p>The board also voted to endorse Proposition 68, which would allocate $4 billion of statewide funds for California water conservation, water projects and outdoor recreation, including parks.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents can vote on Measure R and Proposition 68 in the primary election on June 5.</p>\n<p>The group also voted to move forward with St. George Family Youth Center’s plans for a second mural in Estero Park.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD meets the second Thursday of every month at 6 p.m. in the District office in I.V.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

documents released to the public during the Community Services District’s (CSD) Tuesday meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s very likely that there will be a cannabis dispensary in Isla Vista,” said Ethan Bertrand, CSD president.</p>\n<p>Residents of Santa Barbara County will get the chance to vote on Measure T, also known as the Cannabis Operations General Tax, in the June 5 primary election.</p>\n<p>The board voted to endorse the measure with all board members voting in favor except for George Thurlow, who was absent for the meeting.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, any individual who “engages” in cannabis operations, including the “cultivating, manufacturing, producing, processing, preparing, storing, providing, donating, selling or distributing cannabis” within unincorporated areas of the county would pay a tax on each of the operation’s activities, according to documents released by the county.</p>\n<p>The tax will vary depending on the classification of the business. Nurseries and distributors will pay 1 percent of the total amount an organization receives during its accounting period; manufacturers will pay 3 percent, cultivators will pay 4 percent and retail and micro businesses will pay 6 percent, according to documents released by the county.</p>\n<p>First District Supervisor Das Williams, who chairs the county board, said in a written statement that it is “imperative” that the marijuana is taxed to “ensure compliance and to eradicate the black market.”</p>\n<p>“With legalization comes needed enforcement, education and other services. Santa Barbara County needs to tax cannabis growers and businesses to enforce our ordinance and fund other priorities,” he said in an argument in favor of the measure, which he wrote on behalf of the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p>The board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/land-ordinance-limits-marijuana-sales-in-iv-uc-students-opposed/\">passed an ordinance</a> in early February requiring a buffer zone between marijuana dispensaries and areas with schools or daycare centers, meaning dispensaries cannot be located within 750 feet of these “sensitive areas.”</p>\n<p>Opponents of the measure, including District County Supervisor Peter Adam and Susan Brown, retired sergeant from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement that the measure will be “another blank check” for the county.</p>\n<p>“The County faces a $50 million deficit due to misplaced spending priorities,” the group that wrote the opposition statement on the ballot measure. “They want to spend the money how they want it spent, not how we want it spent.”</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board secretary for the CSD, said he is a big supporter of this measure because it is “necessary” for I.V. to have a dispensary one day.</p>\n<p>“The old I.V. residents would have loved to see this happen,” CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

It is a right, along with … clean air, clean water, and protection from climate impacts,” Creasman said in a press release.</p>\n<p>The legislation will be used to combat the negative effects of California’s natural disasters including the Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara County last December and aid in relief for the Montecito floods, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>A large portion of the bond would fund the implementation of parks in disadvantaged neighborhoods as well as improve the facilities in existing parks, including those in I.V., according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is the lowest income area in the entire county. That sets us up to have priority access to have a lot of the grants that are going to be made available if this bond passes,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>I.V. would be eligible to receive one or more grants that could total up to $200,000 for park improvements. If the proposition is passed, this money could become available close to the end of the year, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>This bond would help California’s economy by increasing job opportunities within national park service in fields including environmental planning, construction and tourism, according to Katalina Vang, California Public Interest Research Group’s (CALPIRG) outreach coordinator at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>CALPIRG is a student-run environmental and political organization on campus at UC Santa Barbara that is advocating for Prop 68 to garner voter support.</p>\n<p>“Prop 68 is actually addressing global warming issues straightforwardly instead of abstractly and we finally are receiving solutions from government officials on how to solve these environmental issues,” Vang said in an email.</p>\n<p>The proposition’s passage would allow for future generations to better conserve the natural resources and guarantee a world that has usable resources, according to Vang.</p>\n<p>“We need to ensure we build a foundation of saving our environment before it gets worse,” she said.</p>\n<p>Despite the number of political leaders and organizations that are in support of the proposition, several public figures openly oppose proposition 68 including Senator John Moorlach, Andrea Seastrand, President of the Central Coast Taxpayers Association and Jon Coupal, President of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.</p>\n<p>Moorlach argued that the bond will do more harm than good because the government would need to raise taxes in order to pay off the money that would need to be borrowed for the measure.</p>\n<p>In an article written by Coupal, he refers to the Legislative Analyst Office report on Prop 68 that estimates that it will take $7.8 billion to pay off the bond: $4 billion in principal spending and $3.8 billion in interest rates.</p>\n<p>“It will take approximately $8 billion to pay off the $4 billion of borrowed funds. That means you can expect a tax increase. And your children can expect a tax increase.

CSD manager. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The tenant-landlord mediation services will foster better relationships between tenants and landlords in I.V. and work out resolutions for disputes, according to Jonathan Abboud, I.V. CSD general manager.</p>\n<p>The program will cost approximately $33,000 which covers the launch date through the end of December 2018, according to Abboud.</p>\n<p>Funding for this program will come from the $200,000 grant awarded to the I.V. CSD from UC Santa Barbara each year. The cost of the project includes payment of the mediator, bilingual assistant, project management, office supplies and insurance.</p>\n<p>The program will operate in the I.V. Community Room on Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Fridays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. During these hours, landlords or tenants can set mediation appointments through an online form found on the I.V. CSD’s website.</p>\n<p>Once a form is submitted, Abboud will contact both parties to schedule an appointment. Mediation is voluntary for both parties, so the scheduling of an appointment would be contingent on the motivation of each party to resolve their conflict.</p>\n<p>During the appointment, a mediator will discuss tenancy issues and help both parties work toward a resolution. The mediator will introduce the rules and conditions of the mediation and act as a neutral party between the landlord and tenant.</p>\n<p>Any discussion during the session is confidential, according to Sayre Macneil, mediator for the CSD.</p>\n<p>After the session, users will complete an evaluation form that the CSD will use to monitor the helpfulness of the program.</p>\n<p>Community members can drop in for counsel on tenancy issues if they cannot schedule an appointment, according to Abboud.</p>\n<p>The program is available for all community members in I.V. This service will not be available for students living in UC Santa Barbara housing, including the Santa Catalina Residence Hall, San Joaquin Villages, Santa Ynez, San Clemente Villages and Storke Family Housing.</p>\n<p>The CSD held a forum Monday to introduce the program and its mediator to the public. Macneil spoke about his experience in mediation and his preference for mediation over court action in resolving conflict.</p>\n<p>Macneil says mediation is a more humane avenue of settling disputes as opposed to using the court system, which can often be time consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>Macneil has been a practicing attorney since 1984 and received a certificate in Mediation and Dispute Resolution at the UC Santa Barbara Extension program.</p>\n<p>He said he has worked on several mediation cases involving landlord and tenant relationships and has identified systemic problems throughout these relationships that repeat themselves in individual cases, such as loss of security deposit, maintenance needs and communication issues.</p>\n<p>He said that solving disputes is often a matter of providing a space for people to express and acknowledge grievances as well as to hear the other party in a non-threatening way.</p>\n<p>“When they can understand that the other side has some legitimacy to their point of view, a resolution is 20 minutes away,” Macneil said.</p>\n<p>The program also includes a bilingual translator to assist mediation with Spanish speaking residents.</p>\n<p>Undocumented families living within I.V. might have more challenges in resolving tenancy issues and enforcing their rights due to their vulnerability as undocumented immigrants/citizens, Macneil said.</p>\n<p>“There are things that make these circumstances such that people need some education in the process about what their rights are,” Macneil said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

district member” on the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which oversees special districts in the county. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Conflict-of-interest rules state that a public official has a “disqualifying conflict of interest” in a government decision if it is “foreseeable” that the official could be financially impacted by the decision.</p>\n<p>If a public official might be financially affected by a decision, they must recuse themselves from the vote in order to avoid bias, according to the rules, which come from the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC).</p>\n<p>There are exemptions, but none of them appear to apply to Tuesday’s vote, which took place at the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The position Bertrand is running for is the “alternate special district member” on the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which oversees special districts in the county.</p>\n<p>As people move into cities, the LAFCO makes sure spaces remain open and resources are protected. An alternate member takes part in LAFCO affairs when the regular members cannot be present or need to recuse themselves. For each meeting attended, the member makes $150 without benefits.</p>\n<p>Bertrand secured the nomination with four “yes” votes, one “no” vote and two abstentions.</p>\n<p>If Bertrand had not voted for himself and instead abstained, he would not have received the nomination.</p>\n<p>The FPPC didn’t offer a direct opinion on the matter since “only an investigation determines whether violations have occurred.”</p>\n<p>“Generally speaking, the responsibility is on public officials to avoid conflicts,” Jay Wierenga, the FPPC communications director, said in an email. He went on to say officials are recommended by law to avoid “even the appearance” of conflicts.</p>\n<p>David Seymour, another nominee for the LAFCO position, did recuse himself when his special district, the Santa Ynez CSD, voted to nominate him. Seymour, a 14-year veteran of the Santa Ynez CSD, left the room while the vote took place.</p>\n<p>“I had to leave, I left, I recused myself,” Seymour told the <em>Nexus.</em> “I can’t vote for myself. By going to LAFCO, there’s financial conditions and so you can’t do that. That’s against the law.”</p>\n<p>At Tuesday’s CSD meeting, Bertrand introduced his intent to run for the vacant position on the Santa Barbara LAFCO. While fellow directors Robert Geis and George Thurlow immediately mentioned and seconded a motion to place him in the position, Bertrand faced hesitation from director Jay Freeman.</p>\n<p>Freeman told the board it should throw its support behind Seymour, citing Seymour’s experience in and around LAFCO through the years.</p>\n<p>To that end, Freeman noted LAFCO’s emphasis on nitty gritty aspects of the larger county and said it would look bad if the I.V. CSD nominated someone who hadn’t attended enough LAFCO meetings.</p>\n<p>Going for this position would spread Bertrand too thin, Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“I like that you’re excited to do this, but it seems like a stretch given all you’re doing here,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand defended his qualifications, saying the LAFCO needs more younger folks and people of color in the way of diversity.</p>\n<p>He later told the <em>Nexus</em> that he has attended “quite a few” LAFCO meetings “over the past couple of years.”</p>\n<p>Thurlow stepped in, telling Bertrand to step down from facilitating the discussion since he had a direct interest in the outcome.</p>\n<p>Particularly, Thurlow said Bertrand should recuse himself from running the meeting, but “not necessarily from voting.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Bertrand stood by his decision to vote on the matter.</p>\n<p>“I still believe that what I did was within my rights and responsibilities,” he told the <em>Nexus</em>. “I’m still comfortable with it.”</p>\n<p>He directed the<em> Nexus</em> to the CSD’s legal counsel for further questions. G. Ross Trindle, who serves as the CSD’s legal counsel and sits in on most meetings, was not present Tuesday night for the board’s discussion.</p>\n<p>In the actual election between Seymour, Bertrand and any others nominated by their special districts, it would be the districts themselves that decide who gets the position.</p>\n<p>There are 37 special districts in the county and each of them will have a vote.</p>\n<p>In a similar situation in January, recently-elected Santa Barbara Mayor Cathy Murillo voted to replace a fellow city councilmember with herself on a countywide transportation board, <a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/santa_barbara_city_council_yanks_jason_dominguez_from_key_transportation_pa\">Noozhawk</a> reported. The council’s final vote was 3-2 and Murillo’s vote for herself ensured her board membership.</p>\n<p>Members on the board in question make between $2-3,000 per year, according to data provided by <a href=\"https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/santa-barbara-county-association-of-governments/?page=3&amp;s=-gross\">Transparent California</a>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The story previously referred to the LAFCO position as a “paid position with Santa Barbara County.” While it oversees the entire county, LAFCO is not directly tied to the County of Santa Barbara. </em></p>\n<p><em>In addition, the story previously said Bertrand told the </em>Nexus <em>he attends LAFCO meetings quite often. His exact words were, “I have attended quite a few over the past couple of years.” </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

This would result in the loss of four to five one-way trips per weekday. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>At an Isla Vista Community Services District (IVCSD) meeting on Tuesday, Hillary Blackerby, MTD marketing and community relations manager, presented the changes to the CSD, the first time the MTD has presented to the I.V. governance board.</p>\n<p>Before the creation of the CSD, the MTD held community meetings in various locations in Isla Vista, Goleta and Santa Barbara to propose service changes.</p>\n<p>Line 15x, the SBCC/UCSB Express, runs between SBCC, UCSB and Isla Vista. The suggested changes would improve time performance, simplify the bus route and create more access to SBCC.</p>\n<p>The line will no longer switch directions midday which has previously caused confusion and delay, according to Blackerby. Bus service on Friday between 4:30 and 6:30 p.m. will also be eliminated as there are very few classes at that time.</p>\n<p>Lines 7, 10 and 27 will see “minor” changes that would overall improve time performance, Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>The changes on line 27, the Isla Vista Shuttle, include adding more time to each trip in order to decrease the delays. This would result in the loss of four to five one-way trips per weekday.</p>\n<p>“It takes a while to get through I.V. in a bus because of all the congestion on the street and obviously to get through safely we need to go slow […] When you do something like that [adding time to each trip] it’s not very noticeable,” Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>The MTD will also temporarily discontinue line 21x, Carpinteria Express, until the Highway 101 HOV lanes are opened.</p>\n<p>Every April, the MTD informs the communities they serve of the upcoming changes to the bus services, which are then officially put into effect in August of that same year.</p>\n<p>A year ago, the MTD p<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/\">roposed new fareboxes</a> that would allow UCSB students to tap their ID cards on the farebox instead of showing a sticker that is given out every quarter.</p>\n<p>This new technology has been implemented in a few buses and, according to Blackery, the MTD is “getting close” to fully integrating the new fareboxes.</p>\n<p>IVCSD Board Secretary Spencer Brandt brought up the possibility of creating or modifying a bus line that would allow students to access Calle Real/Fairview marketplaces, which includes stores like Trader Joe’s.</p>\n<p>According to Google Maps, students can take either the 11 or 24x bus lines toward Goleta and walk 20 to 30 minutes to get to the Calle Real Shopping Center, or take either of those buses and transfer to the number 7, Goleta Old Town, line and walk a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Since its start in August 2016, Line 28 has been a “rousing success” to the point where the MTD will eventually require more support from UCSB, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said that both of these issues are being discussed at MTD.</p>\n<p>Blackerby also said that because line 28 buses often get filled to capacity at the El Colegio and Camino Corto stop across Santa Catalina, people looking to get on at different stops along El Colegio are sometimes “out of luck.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Del Playa Rentals proprietor’s arraignment had been delayed five times, but on Thursday his lawyers offered a not guilty plea after unsuccessfully arguing to have the case dismissed. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-11/isla-vista-landlord-yells-homophobic-slurs-at-i-v-csd-president-on-state-street/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a November incident captured on video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Gelb persistently called Bertrand a “fag” and made lewd references to anal sex after Bertrand had told Gelb he was unkind to his residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand, the president of the I.V. Community Services District, is openly gay. His friend recorded the video, which was shared widely on the internet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">District Attorney Joyce Dudley </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/isla-vista-landlord-charged-with-criminal-complaint-after-yelling-homophobic-slurs-at-csd-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indicted Gelb on a misdemeanor charge of “disturbing the peace”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November. His arraignment was then <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-20/i-v-landlord-gelbs-arraignment-repeatedly-postponed/\">delayed five times</a> over a four-month span until Gelb’s representation pleaded not guilty on Thursday. Gelb was not present in court for the arraignment and has not appeared at any previous hearings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griselda Carreon, associate attorney for Lynn &amp; O’Brien, LLP, argued in court to have the case dismissed, citing reasons that included Gelb’s right to free speech and the notion that the specific offensive language in question had not been specified by the prosecution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prosecutor Carl Barnes noted that other crimes, like battery, do not specify the precise nature of the harm committed. He pointed to the online video as a clear representation of the words used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Superior Court Judge Raimundo Montes De Oca pointed out a line in the California penal code, which states, “offensive words in a public place which are inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction” can be designated as a crime against public peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carreon argued the language was not likely to provoke violence, referring to Bertrand having told police that he had sought to de-escalate the situation and was a person who believed in nonviolence. She also said the video was “unauthenticated” and “may have been clipped.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said Bertrand and “his buddy” had “laughed, smirked and continued to taunt Mr. Gelb.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montes De Oca denied the demurrer, a request to dismiss the lawsuit, on the basis that the police report offered clear discovery of the crime Gelb was being accused of, as well as a shortage in facts that are necessary to compel a case dismissal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montes De Oca set a pre-trial conference date for June 4. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unfortunate to see the various excuses for horrible behavior that have come up during this process,” Bertrand told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in response to the notion that he had “taunted” Gelb. “But I continue to believe that people must be held accountable for their actions against the LGBTQ community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand, who has attended every hearing since Gelb’s first arraignment date, praised the “many community leaders” who have made statements in support of the LGBTQ+ community in the aftermath of the incident.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gelb’s attorneys from Lynn &amp; O’Brien have not responded to requests for comment. Barnes also declined to comment after the arraignment.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Bertrand used the word “unfortunate,” not “unfair.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Taxpayers from each zone provide the funding, which the governments then distribute to libraries in the county. While the amount of funding remains unchanged after the vote, Isla Vista will now provide a larger percentage of the funding.</p>\n<p>I.V. government leaders support the rezoning and believe it could be a step toward a “bookmobile” and a small, permanent library in I.V.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County currently gives the library $7.80 of per-capita funding from each resident of unincorporated areas. Since I.V. is an unincorporated area, its residents generate approximately $180,000 of per-capita funding annually.</p>\n<p>The new zone will include Isla Vista, Buellton, Solvang, Eastern Goleta Valley, Community Service Area 3 and Hope Ranch.</p>\n<p>The Goleta Library currently belongs to Zone 1, which is run by the City of Santa Barbara and encompasses Eastside Library, Goleta, Montecito, Carpinteria, Buellton and Solvang.</p>\n<p>Gina Fischer, district representative for Supervisor Joan Hartmann, said she is hopeful the board’s vote will better help the City of Goleta serve I.V. residents — including students, children and families. Hartmann, who represents I.V. as Third County Supervisor, voted in favor of the rezoning at the Tuesday meeting.</p>\n<p>Currently, any resident of Santa Barbara County can obtain a free library card at any branch as part of a “cooperative network,” a resource Fischer said many students are unaware of.</p>\n<p>CSD President Ethan Bertrand expressed his support for the rezoning during the board of supervisors’ April 3 meeting. The CSD directors are hopeful that Zone 4’s creation will benefit the residents of Isla Vista, as they will now have a larger stake in the services by paying for more of the funding.</p>\n<p>The CSD and the City of Goleta have proposed the creation of a “bookmobile” that would travel from the Camino Real Marketplace through I.V. They also spoke about the eventual installment of a small, permanent library.</p>\n<p>Director Spencer Brandt spoke optimistically about these ideas, calling them “a step in the right direction” toward providing I.V. residents the services they deserve considering the funds they would provide.</p>\n<p>Brandt added that there is not much leverage over how the county’s money is spent and hopes the rezoning will open doors.</p>\n<p>“We need to work towards library services that are based full-time out of Isla Vista and are tailored to our unique community needs,” he said.</p>\n<p>CSD director and county appointee Bob Geis also spoke of the lack of library services in the community, as well as the difficulty of accessing the Goleta Library for I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>For residents to reach the library, which is fairly inaccessible by public transportation, it would require walking past Fairview, across the freeway overpass, from the nearest bus stop.</p>\n<p>Both Brandt and Geis are hopeful that bringing library services closer to I.V. will take place in the future, as it is a stepping stone in ensuring the funds allocated maximize services for residents.</p>\n<p>“I’m very supportive of the effort to move towards mobile library services, and think it is the first step towards even bigger and better things, and towards a funding allocation model that makes sure the money generated in Isla Vista is being spent on services in Isla Vista,” Brandt said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
