Lavagnino at Rusty’s Pizza Parlor.</span> <em>Cristian Loza / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late 2016, California voters passed Proposition 64, legalizing recreational marijuana use and cultivation for adults 21 and older. In January 2018, it became legal to both sell and tax the sales of marijuana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, “Where’s the pot?” Christian Alonso, field director of the Santa Barbara Young Democrats asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the two and a half year mark approaches since the passage of Prop 64, Santa Barbara has yet to see it’s first recreational dispensary. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/news/2018/jul/10/three-pot-shops-get-green-light-santa-barbara/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, three recreational cannabis dispensaries were authorized early last year to open in Santa Barbara city. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hear loud and clear that folks in Isla Vista want a dispensary in Isla Vista, and that makes sense, you don’t want the purchasing power of Isla Vistans to be sent out of Isla Vista where none of the tax revenue or benefit will go to I.V.,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams went on to address how taxed marijuana proceeds would go toward hiring marijuana regulation employees, such as law enforcement and ad commissioners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After speaking to a consultant, they speculate we could make between 5 and 25 million dollars a year,” Williams said. “This taxed money is collected by Santa Barbara County  and would go back to funding the people and not the government itself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prop 64 elicits specific </span><a href=\"https://dispensarypermits.com/united-states-marijuana-dispensary-laws/open-a-dispensary-in-california/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that must be followed when establishing a retail dispensary. For example, dispensaries must be at least 600 feet from any school (K-12), daycare or youth center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams speculated I.V. would receive a recreational dispensary, but the location must be precise due to youth centers like UCSB’s Children’s Center and I.V. Elementary School.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have more plans for retail, we are just trying to figure out how that’s going to work,” Lavagnino said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People still have really strong feelings about it, it’s like navigating a public minefield,” Lavagnino said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_64,_Marijuana_Legalization_(2016)\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ballotpedia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 57 percent of Californians voted yes to Prop 64 in 2016, which allowed recreational marijuana use for those over the age of 21. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Legalizing marijuana is more ethical than buying it off the black market,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federally, marijuana is still </span><a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">classified</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it is addictive with no medical value. This places it in the same category as cocaine and methamphetamines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A regime which uplifts, reforms and permits the best of the operations and crushes the worst is what we want. The potential of hurting the cartel with legalization is something really powerful,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s all about tracking and trace of custody, we want people to know where their marijuana will be coming from.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He continued to discuss how a retail store is much safer than many of the commonly offered marijuana delivery services, because they can be regulated and tracked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are some things that are really bad about marijuana. For example, it affects your level of motivation. But compared to other medications like opiates, there is no comparison,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the drug becomes progressively more available, Williams and Lavagnino suspect that a lot of marijuana’s negative stigma will begin to fade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’ll just take time and exposure,” Lavagnino said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/","id":3715,"author":{"id":254,"name":"Cristian Loza"},"related":[3714,3713,3712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Issue Five Citations During Underage Drinking Decoy Operation in I.V. & Goleta","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2019-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WelcomeToIslaVista-1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WelcomeToIslaVista-1.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Overall, 67 people were contacted in I.V. and Goleta.

All three cited Nguyen’s racial and gender diversity, compared to the previously all-male board, as factors in their decision, along with her experience campaigning for Measure R and her publicity experience in Alpha Delta Pi and Campus Democrats.</p>\n<p>“It’s incumbent on all of us to be building the next generation of leaders, and diverse generation of leaders,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“I believe that Kristie brings different involvement in the community that we don’t really have at the table right now, especially with her involvement with leadership in the Greek community and sorority community,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Although voting in support of the motion to appoint Nguyen, directors Jay Freeman and Jon Hedges pointed to Levine as their initial pick for the position.</p>\n<p>Levine’s widespread work and “valuable” familiarity with other I.V. groups, including I.V. Recreation and Park District and the Environmental Affairs Board, made him better suited for the position, Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“Everyone I talked to has dealt with Jeremy Levine and no one I talked to had ever dealt with Kristie,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman came to the meeting on Tuesday intending to support Sherman for the position, but after Sherman dropped, Freeman turned his support to Levine.</p>\n<p>“I really wanted to come here and be excited to put a woman on our board,” Freeman said. “I’m backing with Jeremy right now.”</p>\n<p>Hedges cited Levine’s record of “reaching across the aisle [and] having a sense of who’s across the aisle” in regard to different political and social groups in I.V. as his reason for supporting Levine.</p>\n<p>“We have to continually reach for that which unites us somehow, that coalesces us somehow, that unifies us somehow in a way that transcends our party,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>During her term, Nguyen said she wants to focus on issues I.V. residents are currently facing, including women’s rights, sexual assault, public safety, lighting deficiencies and lack of parking.</p>\n<p>Nguyen said her variety of perspectives and involvement in the community and campus is an advantage that will be applicable to her service on the board.</p>\n<p>“Students definitely want to see a familiar face and to know that there is someone just like them that can run for a leadership role,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>Nguyen hopes the experience she gains during her term will help her work on policymaking in the future.</p>\n<p>“I feel so honored, really, to be on a board of so many people that are so experienced with local government and policymaking, and that’s what I want to do in the future. I’m just so excited,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [5:18 p.m.]: Levine is a member of the Environmental Affairs Board, not the Environmental Awareness Board, as stated in a previous version of this article.</em></p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD) Director Natalie Jordan. Jordan, who officially left in January 2019, previously told the <em>Nexus</em> that she felt it was time for “someone else to step into that position.”</p>\n<p>Jordan had served her original two-year term, but the terms of office had changed for her seat due to technicalities in election code.</p>\n<p>The individual who will fill Jordan’s empty seat will hold the position until December 2020.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD will interview all of the candidates and vote on who to select during Tuesday night’s meeting, which will begin at 4:30 p.m. The board previously extended the deadline to apply before the application period closed on Feb. 19.</p>\n<p>Previously, four candidates had applied; however, Goleta-based psychologist Jeremy Roark withdrew from the race on Monday, citing the “importance of student representation” for the board.</p>\n<p>The agenda for Tuesday’s meeting can be viewed <a href=\"https://islavistacsd.ca.gov/files/764548f33/2_26_19+Regular+Meeting+Agenda.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Overviews of the candidates’ qualifications and experience can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><strong>Fourth-year economics and statistical science double major Jeremy Levine:</strong></p>\n<p>Levine described Isla Vista as “a little slice of paradise.”</p>\n<p>“It’s in a lot of ways a melting pot of different people and personalities getting to just pursue learning and living and having a good time,” Levine told the <em>Nexus</em>. “So why the CSD? I would like to represent these people, and I would like to make this place which I view as a little slice of paradise even closer to the ideal of what it could be.”</p>\n<p>Levine cited his financial experience both as an editor for The Bottom Line and as an intern for the Economic Forecast Project when asked what he believed he could bring to the board.</p>\n<p>“I think what makes me unique is my approach to solving issues here. It is a very solutions-driven approach. It is a process-driven approach,” he said.</p>\n<p>If chosen for the board, Levine would focus on gathering information from the community about their needs and then would want to use that data to plan the board’s priorities for the year.</p>\n<p>Levine also said he has a special interest in prioritizing environmental awareness and environmental justice in I.V., emphasizing his background as co-chair of the Environmental Awareness Board and his environmentally-friendly work in I.V. since he first arrived at UCSB.</p>\n<p>When asked about the board’s diversity, Levine admitted that he doesn’t quite “bring any diversity to the table,” noting that the board is currently all male and primarily white, and that the two other candidates might have more to offer in terms of their lived experiences.</p>\n<p>However, Levine believes that he could bridge that gap by prioritizing accessibility and outreach as a member of the board, and he hopes to ensure that the board elected by the end of his term in December 2020 will “look dramatically different from the current board” in diversity, socioeconomic background and role in I.V.</p>\n<p>Although Levine will graduate from UCSB in Spring 2019 with a double major in economics and statistical science, he plans to remain in I.V. to work at the California Center for Public Policy in Santa Barbara and, if elected, for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p><strong>Second-year pre-sociology major Kristie Nguyen:</strong></p>\n<p>In her resume, Nguyen describes herself as an “Isla Vista resident with a passion for politics and the community.”</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista has become my home away from home, a community that I have grown a deep connection with,” she said in her cover letter, speaking of how she wants to represent both the students and the permanent I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“My goal is to make sure that every student and resident that is asked about their residency in Isla Vista is smiling because of their genuine care and love for it.”</p>\n<p>She has experience working in public relations for two UCSB organizations: Campus Democrats and Alpha Delta Pi sorority. She is currently Campus Democrats’ publicity director and is on the public relations committee in the Alpha Delta Pi sorority.</p>\n<p>She has also worked as an intern for Santa Barbara Mayor Cathy Murillo, for Congressman Salud Carbajal and for Assembly Member Monique Limon.</p>\n<p>Nguyen has prior involvement with the I.V. CSD’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\">Measure R campaign</a>, where she worked as the publicity coordinator.</p>\n<p>In her cover letter, she pointed out that she would be the “the first and only woman of color on the board” – referring to the board’s currently all-male and majority white status – and that she would “offer diverse and beneficial input on the development of community, student representation, and women’s rights.”</p>\n<p>Her specific goals include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increasing the number of CSOs on the 67 and 68 blocks of I.V., and have them “actively patrolling” areas that contain “active parties,” such as Del Playa Drive and fraternity neighborhoods;</li>\n<li>encouraging CSOs to be “more proactive” by asking residents if they need help rather than waiting for calls;<br>\ninstalling additional lighting in I.V., particularly on the further blocks;</li>\n<li>limiting I.V. parking to I.V. residents;</li>\n<li>promoting housing affordability;</li>\n<li>improving the I.V. CSD’s reputation by promoting the district’s social media platforms;</li>\n<li>and “ensuring that women are a prioritized topic of discussion and that the local government stands with victims.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Installing additional lighting is already a project <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\">being tackled</a> by the I.V. CSD in partnership with UCSB’s External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office and the Associated Students Lobby Corps.</p>\n<p>Nguyen did not specify in her cover letter how she would limit parking to I.V. residents or promote housing affordability, nor where the funding would come from for additional CSOs.</p>\n<p>She plans to graduate from UCSB with the class of 2021 with a sociology major and a minor in Asian American studies.</p>\n<p>Nguyen did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-year sociology and Chinese double major Lindsay Sherman:</strong></p>\n<p>In her cover letter, Sherman cited her communication skills as a reason she would be fit for the board.</p>\n<p>“I am passionate about serving my community and enhancing the quality of life for its members when and where I can,” Sherman says in her cover letter. “I believe my experience, knowledge, and interpersonal abilities would make me a perfect fit for this position.”</p>\n<p>Sherman did not outline a specific list of goals that she would tackle if elected.</p>\n<p>She currently works as a teaching assistant at the UCSB Orfalea Family Children’s Center, stating in her cover letter that she “work[s] with several teachers, administrators, and coworkers every day in order to enrich the lives and experiences of the attending children and their families as much as possible.”</p>\n<p>Sherman has also volunteered as a middle school international teacher for the Green Lion Bali Foundation in Bali, Indonesia, as well as two educational programs in Santa Barbara: the SciTrek Elementary School Teaching Program and the Volunteer Elementary School Teaching Assistant.

It did damage to the ecosystem, the environment and the economy,” Carbajal said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>Carbajal is hopeful for his new bill, noting that the bill has a better chance of passing since it was submitted to a congress where a Republican majority is no longer in effect.</p>\n<p>“[In] the last congress, I was a minority, and the Republican lead leadership did not allow this to move forward. I’m very excited about the prospects this time around,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Of the 53 representatives in California, 42 have co-signed California Clean Coast Act, also known as HR 279, reflecting current sentiments to orient the state toward renewable energy  and away from oil and gas.</p>\n<p>“These are not abstract issues for the Central Coast and Santa Barbara. These are issues that we’ve experienced and to us, it’s tangible,” Carbajal said. “We need to wean ourselves and become less dependent on fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy.”</p>\n<p>In addition to HR 279, Carbajal has also proposed legislation on the subject of renewable energy.</p>\n<p>“Last term I introduced — which I am going to reintroduce again — the Renewable Energy opportunities legislation, which provides tax incentives to the business community so they invest in renewable energy technology.”</p>\n<p>The California Clean Coast Act would only be applied to the coastline and waters of California.</p>\n<p>To address California lands, Jackson, a state senator representing Santa Barbara’s 19th district, introduced Senate Bill 169, a new piece of legislation dealing with pipeline safety requirements, according to a press release.</p>\n<p>The current regulations in place allow pipeline operations in California to exploit loopholes within the state’s legal system, according to Jackson.</p>\n<p>“If you are operating a pipeline to full capacity, you have to follow California’s law. If, however, you are only operating to partial capacity, you don’t have to follow California law,” Jackson said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>SB 169 would require that all pipelines in California, regardless of their operation capacity, follow the same regulations, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>The bill would also ensure pipeline inspectors have the tools necessary to verify that all pipeline operations in the state are in compliance with the law.</p>\n<p>Jackson is hopeful that SB 169 will pass.</p>\n<p>“I’m confident that the legislature recognizes the importance of protecting against these spills,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>However, Jackson still holds some doubt about the fate of Carbajal’s legislation.</p>\n<p>She said that Carbajal’s “aspirational” bill would likely face legislative friction if it ever made an appearance on President Trump’s desk. However, she said the next couple of years could provide a less hostile environment for green legislation.</p>\n<p>“If we have a positive result in 2020, this is certainly the kind of thing that we should be pushing from,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>After previous attempts to remediate pipeline safety requirements through legislation, Jackson said she believes that there is only one definitive way to end disasters like this: “If you don’t drill, you can’t spill.”</p>\n<p><i>Simren Verma contributed reporting.</i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at maxabrams@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

To some extent, their calls seem to have been heard.</p>\n<p>Hannah-Beth Jackson, Santa Barbara’s state senator representing California’s 19th district and author of SB 1346, optimistically expressed approval for the new gun control laws.</p>\n<p>Although these laws encompass the entire state, UCSB’s past experience with gun violence oftentimes compels many local leaders and students to be more vocal about their opinions on the issue of gun control.</p>\n<p>In May 2014, a violent attack in I.V. left six people dead. Half died due to gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p>“[UCSB] students will support these laws by being reminded that we need to do more — this will give them an incentive to call for more action, particularly at the federal level to combat gun violence,” Jackson said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>Combating gun violence has been an ongoing initiative in California, highlighted by legislative action taken by former California Governor Jerry Brown.</p>\n<p>While Gov. Brown did sign some bills addressing gun control, he also vetoed a number of them, some of which could have reduced the number of guns in the state, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>In the context of gun control, Jackson has high expectations for Gov. Newsom.</p>\n<p>“I expect him to be very supportive of policies that help reduce gun violence and keep our communities safe,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jackson believes her bump-stock bill, SB 1346, will have an impact in reducing gun violence by prohibiting access to bump stocks in California and will hopefully reduce the number of gun deaths in the state.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy to see that our representative Hannah Beth Jackson introduced SB 1346,” Jeike Meijer, Associated Students (A.S.) executive vice president of local affairs, said in an email.</p>\n<p>Meijer spoke at the vigil for the 11 lives lost in a Pittsburgh synagogue due to gun violence and then again at the vigil in remembrance of the Thousand Oaks shooting victims.</p>\n<p>Both mass shootings occurred in November.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’ll see the rest of the country follow California soon,” Meijer added.</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel, A.S. president, believes the new legislation will be effective.</p>\n<p>“[Gun violence] is always on people’s minds, on prospective students’ minds, and I think that these kinds of measures are exactly what we need to have students feel more comfortable and safe in Isla Vista,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>Kopel believes that SB 1100 specifically, which raises the minimum age to 21 to purchase a firearm, would make UCSB students more comfortable “knowing that the people around them can’t even purchase a firearm.”</p>\n<p>“Even though most of the students that are attending this university now weren’t here to experience the 2014 shooting, that legacy does live on through vigils and remembrances,” Kopel added.</p>\n<p>Still, Kopel finds that more work needs to be done and believes that a “cultural change” regarding guns is needed in the United States.</p>\n<div

done.</p>\n<p>Limón is specifically looking forward to the potential impacts of AB 3129, which imposes a lifetime ban on individuals convicted of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>“I am especially hopeful that AB 3129… will make an impact in reducing the rate of women and children who die at the hands of repeat domestic abusers,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, believes that California serves as a model for the rest of the country when it comes to gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“As a resident of Isla Vista, I feel like my voice has been heard and that our calls for reducing the amount of gun violence in this country are actually being taken seriously,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>While Brandt believes that California is an effective leader on gun control legislation, he does not think the federal government has been adequately following California’s lead.</p>\n<p>“The national government, under the Republican Party, has decided that they’re going to pretend like they can ignore this issue and it’ll just go away,” Brandt said. “I think that that philosophy is something that has never worked out well and never been viewed well by history.”</p>\n<p>“The federal government used to look to California as a model, because these are the sorts of bills that should be implemented nationally.”</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal said that he’s fighting for just that: he wants pieces of California gun control legislation to be laws of the nation.</p>\n<p>Carbajal plans to reintroduce the Gun Violence Restraining Act in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>“[The Gun Violence Restraining Act] allows family members, when they come across a loved one that seems to be, through their behavior, posing a danger to themselves or others… to work with law enforcement, officials and the court system to temporarily take guns away from [that individual],” Carbajal said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually similar to the one that California has in place that was enacted after the tragedy that happened in Isla Vista and UCSB, so it’s duplicating a similar law that exists in California.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal believes that the new California gun control legislation will enhance gun safety in California, and says he is “working to introduce similar legislation and be part of similar legislation introduced here in the House of Representatives.”</p>\n<p>“Far too many lives continue to be taken due to unnecessary gun use,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>“We need to make sure we are passing banning assault weapons, that we are banning high capacity magazines and that we move forward with universal background checks and the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act.”</p>\n<p><i>Correction [Jan. 17, 12:11 p.m.]: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article stated that most of the individuals killed in the I.V. attack died of gunshot wounds.

CSD and the university have made small steps toward regulating the electric scooters that often end up scattered on sidewalks, in the ocean or on bike paths.</p>\n<p>At the I.V. CSD’s Tuesday meeting, the board discussed further problems with the scooters, as well as the county’s proposed regulation of them.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County first put limited regulations on the scooters back in November, requiring electric scooter companies to obtain encroachment permits to operate within the county’s boundaries among other stipulations.</p>\n<p>The companies are also required to monitor their fleets, retrieve the scooters “as needed” and manage the number of scooters out, according to a press release sent out by the county in early November. The changes went into effect early December.</p>\n<p>In I.V., the county has also approached the idea of parking zones for the scooters, I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>The county will also implement an annual permit fee, a monthly per-vehicle fee and an impound fee for the companies to pay.</p>\n<p>“The county is going to be a lot more active and they’re kind of tying it to the outdoor space,” Abboud said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>He noted that the county is taking some of the I.V. CSD’s suggestions into account.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the county has now capped the number of scooters per company in I.V. at 200, according to I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>Brandt said that the CSD has also met with Santa Barbara County Supervisor Joan Hartmann to discuss different ways of transportation in I.V.</p>\n<p>UCPD faces its own share of problems when it comes to the scooters.</p>\n<p>Despite the app’s warning that the scooters are not allowed on campus, a threat of a $200 ticket and UCSB’s strict interim policy banning all of the scooters from campus, the department continues to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/ucpd-ups-enforcement-of-electric-scooter-violations/\">impound</a> hundreds of scooters, according to Bowman.</p>\n<p>Lime recently picked up 147 of their scooters from UCPD, but there are still currently 253 Bird scooters in impound. UCPD charges the company $24 a scooter to retrieve them.</p>\n<p>Lime has done a better job than Bird of retrieving scooters and communicating with the university, according to Bowman.</p>\n<p>A Lime representative has been in touch with Bowman to set up an event in Isla Vista to teach residents how to safely use the scooters, and has even offered to move Bird scooters off campus, Bowman said.</p>\n<p>UCPD is currently discussing what to do with the scooters that are not picked up by the companies within the allotted time frame. For example, the department has discussed the idea of dismantling the scooters and recycling the batteries, Bowman said.</p>\n<p>UCSB also created a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/birds-wings-clipped-electric-scooter-ban-in-place-on-campus/\"> policy committee</a> in October to discuss how to address scooters on campus. The committee then floated the idea of geofencing the scooters to help with regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the committee has not yet created a new policy regarding the scooters, according to Jennifer Lofthus, UCSB policy coordinator, ADA compliance and privacy officer.</p>\n<p>“We also continue to keep an eye on statewide concerns and methods of addressing the impacts of the scooters on communities such as ours,” Lofthus said in an email.</p>\n<p>“The committee will convene again at some point in Winter Quarter to discuss but that meeting has not yet been scheduled.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 10 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at evelyn@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Act – signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016 and implemented Jan. 2017 – requires local law enforcement to inform undocumented immigrants of requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) to speak with them.</p>\n<p>Sheriff Brown emphasized during the forum that the prison release dates were public in accordance with state law and are accessible to members of the public, and I.C.E., only if the resident’s name is known.</p>\n<p>He also said that the release dates were public so that residents would be able to know when someone who had committed a crime against them would be out of jail.</p>\n<p>Brown reported that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) released 15,241 inmates in the 2017 calendar year, and I.C.E. requested to be notified of the release dates of 526 of those inmates.</p>\n<p>I.C.E. then picked up 351 of those inmates.</p>\n<p>In Oct. 2017, Governor Brown passed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">Senate Bill 54</a>, which restricted the authority of I.C.E. in regards to local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“[SB 54] curtails the use of state or local resources from engaging in immigration enforcement, effective in 2018, subject to a number of exemptions,” Sheriff Brown said during Tuesday’s forum.</p>\n<p>Between Jan. 1, 2018, and Nov. 30, 2018, SBSO released 11,551 inmates. I.C.E. requested to be notified of the release of 390 of those inmates and then picked up 74 of those.</p>\n<p>SB 54’s passage led immigration officials to spend more time out in the streets, Brown said.</p>\n<p>“Instead of relying primarily on taking inmates from the county jail, they now have started to conduct field operations,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>“[I.C.E.] may be after someone who is a criminal offender, but if that person has other people with them, [and] they determine that those people are undocumented aliens, then oftentimes they will [arrest them as well].”</p>\n<p>Brown noted that this has only created more fear within Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Most immigrants who are in our county, be they documented or undocumented, are good, hardworking people who are otherwise law-abiding. But it’s naive to think that every one of them is like that,” Brown said during the forum.</p>\n<p>“The reality has shown that we have had some very significant crimes committed in our community by people who are illegal aliens. There should be a common desire for everyone to see that people who commit such crimes are members of gangs or who are predisposed to violence for a serious crime, to be removed from our community.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85330\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85330\" data-attachment-id=\"85330\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/sbc-residents-demand-police-end-cooperation-with-i-c-e-during-annual-t-r-u-t-h-act-forum/img_4008/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4008\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85330\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85330\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several Santa Barbara County residents showed up to the forum to protest SBSO’s cooperation with I.C.E. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Numerous residents from Santa Barbara County spoke out against the actions of the local law enforcement during the public forum, demanding an end to the provision of prison release dates to I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Present among the speakers was Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Interim General Manager Jonathan Abboud, who, along with several I.V. and Associated Students officials, presented a petition calling on the sheriff and the County Board of Supervisors to “cease and desist the publication of release dates of all people within the Sheriff’s custody.”</p>\n<p>This sentiment was echoed by the 19 speakers who followed, including representatives from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice and the League of United Latin American Citizens.</p>\n<p>Some of those representatives shared personal anecdotes of family members being taken away by immigration enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p>“I think most of us can agree that the federal government has failed to create a workable immigration process,” Gina Whitaker, an Allies for Immigration representative, said. “There is no line to get into for millions of people who face increasing persecution. The reasons that people are here undocumented are varied and complex and often beyond their control.</p>\n<p>“We need to consider the individual circumstances of each person’s life and recognize the humanity of all people.”</p>\n<p>Joana Barrera, a representative for Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy (C.A.U.S.E.), shared a personal story of her family being separated after police cooperation with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>She explained that her brother had finished his community service when he had been picked up by I.C.E.</p>\n<p>“Luckily he knew his rights and we were able to find him and pick him up from a local shopping center,” she said. “But that really speaks amounts about the lack of trust between the government and residents.”</p>\n<p>“If a person who happens to be an immigrant commits harm, they need to be held accountable like anyone else. But the actions of a few people should not be used to scapegoat whole communities.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

It’s tactically sound for us, it’s the way we’ve been trained, but the community doesn’t understand it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Schroeder said his goal is to identify needs in the community by bringing programs.

Youth Projects and UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students to identify areas that require change.</p>\n<p>Schroeder already started several programs since his appointment as CRD less than a month ago, some of which are pilot programs meant to gauge the response of the community.</p>\n<p>One such project is the party registration program, which allows residents of I.V. to notify law enforcement when they are hosting large parties. Deputies will then send a text to the hosts to alert them if they have received any noise complaints.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have anything like that. All we get is a large party and now we have to try to find a resident and we shut the party down because we can’t find anyone who lives there,” Schroeder said.</p>\n<p>“If we were to send a simple text message, maybe the party would quiet down a little bit.”</p>\n<p>He also wants to implement a diversion program for citations in I.V. Through this program, people who have received tickets for a noise or alcohol violation can attend an educational program and do community service as an alternative to paying fines.</p>\n<p>Schroeder said it would be more beneficial to educate the public rather than punish them and students who cannot afford to pay a hefty fine.</p>\n<p>He also brought up a program designed to educate people on how to react and respond to an active shooter situation. The current program in place is located in Goleta but is also in the works in I.V.</p>\n<p>Schroeder works closely with UC Police Department as well in his position. He is currently working alongside Matt Bowman, community and relations training lieutenant, and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">Kovena Avila</a>, I.V.’s new interpersonal violence detective.</p>\n<p>This collaborative effort brings forth several programs, such as town hall meetings for fraternities and sororities.</p>\n<p>Schroeder emphasized the importance of town hall meetings, as they cover a wide range of topics in I.V. from sexual assault, how to act if pulled over by police or what to do if an individual is caught with an open container.</p>\n<p>Schroeder urges residents of I.V. to contact him with any issues they might have.</p>\n<p>“Bring me what’s bothering you because I don’t know what’s bothering people out there. Sometimes people are a little shy or reserved about telling me. They’ll go to a party or they’ll go home and complain about it to their friends, but we never receive that complaint,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I just want to open up that line of communication and really bring any issues at all to me, and I’ll do my best to address it.”</p>\n<p>Deputy Schroeder can be found at the foot patrol station, located on 6504 Trigo Road in I.V.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
