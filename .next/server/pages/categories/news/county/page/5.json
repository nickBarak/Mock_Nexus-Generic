He was 24 years old.</p>\n<p>The student, Lemar Young, was pronounced dead at the scene following a collision between Young’s motorcycle and a separate vehicle.</p>\n<p>The accident may have been caused by Young traveling at a high rate of speed, said Anthony Wagner, Santa Barbara City Police Department spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Young was initially stopped at a red light on Loma Alta Road near a Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) entrance. He was then traveling eastbound on Cliff Drive when a second vehicle “pulled out of a side driveway of the school,” Wagner said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“[Young] attempted to go from the number two lane to the number one lane at the same time that the driver tried to gun it and go across the way to avoid the motorcycle,” he said.</p>\n<p>“The motorcycle rider fishtailed the bike … which caused him to catapult into the air, landing some distance from where he catapulted.”</p>\n<p>Young was not an SBCC student at the time but had previously taken classes in 2017, according to SBCC spokesperson Luz Reyes-Martin.</p>\n<p>“We are deeply saddened by this tragic accident and our hearts go out to the family, friends and anyone affected by this event,” Reyes-Martin said in an email.</p>\n<p>Young’s family set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/for-lemar-watson\">GoFundMe</a> for funeral costs.</p>\n<p>Noozhawk <a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/authorities_release_name_of_motorcyclist_killed_in_crash_near_sbcc\">previously reported</a> Young was a Goleta resident.

id=\"caption-attachment-46071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SBMTD buses serve the UCSB and I.V. communities within the greater Santa Barbara County.  <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) plans to reach this goal by developing an eco-friendly fleet of zero-emissions buses powered by renewable energy, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>The district hopes this move will reflect its efforts to support climate change solutions.</p>\n<p>SBMTD has a history of leading the way in environmentally-friendly transportation, said Hillary Blackerby, SBMTD interim planning and marketing manager, in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>SBMTD implemented the first electric buses in the U.S. into its fleet in 1991. Today, they have the second largest number of active electric buses out of any transit system in California, the press release stated.</p>\n<p>“We are committed to making this happen,” Jerry Estrada, SBMTD general manager, said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“The whole team at Santa Barbara MTD is proud of our pioneering work in battery-electric transit, and we look forward to continuing to lead the industry towards a zero-emissions future.”</p>\n<p>The cost of this transition is unknown, as bus prices tend to fluctuate significantly with the market, Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>SBMTD recently purchased 14 new 30-foot electric buses, costing $380,000 per bus, she said. The 30-foot buses are used for shuttle service in Santa Barbara; however, for downtown, waterfront and crosstown shuttle, Blackerby projects they would need 40 to 60-foot buses.</p>\n<p>The latter would likely have steeper costs.</p>\n<p>The zero-emissions project will be financed by a combination of funding from the Federal Transit Association, state funding and other grants, Blackerby said. The transition to zero-emission buses will take place as the current buses reach the end of their useful life.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the California Air Resources Board – an organization dedicated to maintaining healthy air quality – is expected to adopt new statewide clean air standards in 2019 which would gradually phase in requirements for public transit agencies to purchase only zero-emission buses over the next few decades.</p>\n<p>These expectations will be met by SBMTD before the new standard is implemented, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>“By setting this goal, MTD can plan this transition, build the necessary charging infrastructure, send a market signal to bus manufacturers, and set Santa Barbara on the path to 100% clean, quiet electric buses powered by 100% renewable energy,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>The transition to zero-emission buses was also due in part to community organizations, including the Community Environmental Council and the local chapter of the Sierra Club. The groups worked to garner support for the plan from other community groups and individuals, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>SBMTD Board Chair Dave Davis said fulfilling the transition will be challenging, but feasible with help from local partners and the transit industry.</p>\n<p>“The MTD Board of Directors knows that it is the right thing to do for our agency, our community, and our planet,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Slajchert</em></p></div>\n<p>At age 24, Slajchert has accomplished a lot.</p>\n<p>Last spring, he graduated from UCSB with a degree in sociology. During his time here, he was a member of the men’s basketball team for four years.</p>\n<p>Most recently, he authored a novel entitled <i>MoonFlower, </i>a coming-of-age book that draws on Slajchert’s real-life experiences, including dealing with the loss of his best friend, Luc Bodden, who Slajchert met when he was 17.</p>\n<p>Growing up in Oak Park, Calif., Slajchert was one of the stars of the Oak Park High School basketball team. It would be there where Slajchert would soon meet Bodden, a six-year-old with sickle cell disease.</p>\n<p>“I remember him coming up to me saying he was so happy to meet me, and he wanted to play basketball with me, and I just knew I had to do it,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>What Slajchert did not know at the time was that one of Bodden’s last wishes before heading into a year of isolation for a bone marrow transplant was to play basketball with him.</p>\n<p>From there, Slajchert’s relationship would continue to grow as he would visit his best friend from behind a glass wall. Something Slajchert remembers vividly from that time is seeing two pictures above Bodden’s hospital bed, one of him and one of Matt Kemp, a star baseball player most notably known for his time with the Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>\n<p>Slajchert said that moment put it in perspective how much Bodden viewed him as a hero.</p>\n<p>“I was only 17 when I saw that, and to see that Luc felt like I was just as famous as Matt Kemp was amazing,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, after four years of being best friends, Slajchert had to say goodbye as Bodden passed away in 2016 at the age of 10.</p>\n<p>Writing <i>MoonFlower</i> was one of the ways Slajchert was able to cope with the loss of his best friend. The very first page of the book is dedicated to Bodden with a phrase that says, “Smile more,” one of the last things Slajchert remembers his friend telling him.</p>\n<p>After beginning to write the novel on June 30, 2016, Slajchert finally saw one of his dreams come true as on Oct. 14 of this year the book was published.Then, just a few weeks later, on Nov. 9 the fires starting hitting Slajchert’s area of Oak Park. He and his family were forced to evacuate.</p>\n<p>“We really had no place to go. I had to call my mom and ask where to go, and she told all of us to pack up and head to Malibu. At the time it was a much safer environment, and we thought it would be all good there,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>One day later, the fire would jump the 101 Freeway and make its way towards Malibu.</p>\n<p>“At the time, I was afraid I was going to lose both houses I grew up in because I had no idea what was going to happen,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>After safely evacuating once again, this time from his mother’s house, Slajchert turned on the news. Hoping for the best, Slajchert did get some good news as his house at Oak Park was safe.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the same could not be said for his house in Malibu.</p>\n<p>“As I was sitting there with my mom watching the news, we saw our actual house go up in flames. My mom just kept shaking me, saying ‘J.D., that’s our house.’” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>“I tried to calm her down but it was extremely difficult for both of us. To have to watch our house on the news just go up in flames was horrific. It was one of the lowest points of my life.”</p>\n<p>Slajchert was devastated. A house he grew up in was gone in an instant.</p>\n<p>One of the things that kept coming to Slajchert’s mind was his friend, Ahrya, who had recently taken a trip to Jamaica. Once Ahrya arrived, he realized he had forgotten his debit card and only had about $100.</p>\n<p>Forced to eat minimally, Ahrya was struggling until he received support from a local woman who invited him to eat with her and her family.</p>\n<p>Once there, Ahrya asked what the woman and her family was doing at a hostel instead of their home. The woman informed him that their house had burned down and they had nowhere else to go just as she was handing Ahrya the food.</p>\n<p>After hearing that, Ahrya could not accept, but the woman kept pleading with him to please take it. After finally agreeing, Ahrya asked just one question: Why was she so quick to help him, a stranger, when her life was in shambles?</p>\n<p>The woman responded by simply saying that they had to share, that they wanted to give back. That story, along with Bodden, kept replaying in Slajchert’s head. Then, he finally made a decision.</p>\n<p>After seeing his house go up in flames, Slajchert decided he was going to donate 100 percent of his book’s earnings to those affected by the Woolsey and Hill fires in a movement he titled #MoonFlowers4Malibu.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people assume you have to have a lot of wealth or popularity to give back to others, but I don’t think that’s the case,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>“I feel like even though I am only 24 and this money could help me get my life started in a lot of different ways, I would rather donate it to those who need it more than me,” he said. “My family and I will be fine, we will figure it out, but there are a lot of people who cannot say the same, so this is my way [of] sharing and my way to keep pushing this message forward.”</p>\n<p>According to Slajchert, 50 percent of the book’s earnings from Nov. 11 onward will be donated to the American Red Cross until Slajchert’s reaches his goal of $15,000. The other 50 percent will be donated to people who were directly affected.</p>\n<p>Since starting the campaign, Slajchert has met with many people. He says while it sometimes becomes overwhelming because there are so many people who need help, what makes the process gratifying is “how selfless some of these people are.”</p>\n<p>Slajchert has said that many times people will meet with him not in hopes of getting help for themselves, but for their own friends that need it more than they do.</p>\n<p>“I would say that every person I have met with has referred me to five more people that need help more than them,” he said. “To me, it just shows the strength of the community.”</p>\n<p>To this day, <i>MoonFlower</i> continues to help Slajchert cope with tragedy. First, it helped him cope with the loss of his best friend. Now, it helps him cope with the loss of his home. And he could not be happier.</p>\n<p>“The idea of sharing with others has been the perfect distraction. Watching my house burn down was the saddest day of my life, but starting the campaign the very next day was the happiest,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, Slajchert would have been happy if people purchased his book because it would be a testament to his writing. Now, he is happy because the purchase of a copy goes beyond helping him and the reader; it helps those who truly need it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Angeles, Orange, Plumas, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Sutter, Tehama, Ventura and Yuba.</p>\n<p>Any individual from those 14 counties enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.) program can purchase hot foods with these benefits until Dec. 17.</p>\n<p>This includes all S.N.A.P. benefit recipients within those counties, not just those who have been affected by the recent fires.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of California residents are trying to piece their lives back together even as these wildfires continue blazing,” said Brandon Lipps, the acting deputy of Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, in a <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/pressrelease/2018/025118\">press release</a> sent out last Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“This waiver will allow residents more flexibility to use in feeding their families as they get back on their feet.”</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, those in the program can only purchase cold foods, such as bread, cereal, fruits, vegetables, dairy products and meats, as stipulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) website.</p>\n<p>S.N.A.P. benefits typically cannot be used to buy alcoholic beverages, pet foods, soaps, household supplies, vitamins, medicines and hot foods among other restrictions.</p>\n<p>Hot foods are the only temporary exception on the aforementioned list.</p>\n<p>The department will also provide “mass replacement of SNAP benefits” for those who experienced food losses due to power outages in the Butte and Plumas counties, the press release stated.</p>\n<p>There are currently five fires burning across California, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE).</p>\n<p>Two of the largest fires, the <a href=\"http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/2277\">Camp Fire</a> in Butte County and the <a href=\"http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/2282\">Woolsey Fire</a> in Ventura, are 100 percent contained as of late November.</p>\n<p>More than 80 people have died in the Camp Fire, according to CAL FIRE.</p>\n<p>A full map of all current fires in California can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><iframe

Read about their campaign promises and what they plan to do during their times in their respective offices below:</p>\n<p><strong>Governor Gavin Newsom</strong></p>\n<p>Gavin Newsom (D), former San Francisco major and lieutenant governor of California, won the gubernatorial seat in the 2018 midterm election. Newsom campaigned in support of expanding healthcare, diminishing the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) influence on legislation, protecting California’s status as a sanctuary state, closing the gender pay gap and protecting women’s reproductive rights, according to his campaign website.</p>\n<p>His platform consists of expanding economic growth through a new job training system, improving infrastructure and maintaining California values of diversity and social equality.</p>\n<p>He won against his Republican opponent, John Cox.</p>\n<p><strong>Secretary of State Alex Padilla</strong></p>\n<p>Alex Padilla (D) was elected for a second term as secretary of state. During his campaign, he directed voters to his previous terms as secretary of state, state senator and president of Los Angeles City Council.</p>\n<p>Padilla said in his candidate statement that his work in the last four years helped to register millions of eligible voters in California. He pointed to his beginnings as the son of immigrant parents with blue-collar jobs as an indication of his commitment to working-class families.</p>\n<p>He won over the majority of voters against his opponent, Mark Meuser (R).</p>\n<p><strong>California Senator Dianne Feinstein</strong></p>\n<p>Now officially elected to her fifth term in the U.S. Senate, Dianne Feinstein (D) ran on a progressive platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Feinstein cited her experience in the position in previous years for issues including immigrants’ rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and universal healthcare.</p>\n<p>She promised to attack prerogatives of the Trump Agenda such as his anti-immigration policies and proposed oil drilling permits off California’s coast, according to her candidate statement in the 2018 Voter Guide.</p>\n<p>Feinstein won the majority vote against her opponent, Kevin de León (D).</p>\n<p><strong>24th Congressional District Representative Salud Carbajal</strong></p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara alumnus Salud Carbajal won the majority vote for representative of California’s 24th congressional district for a second term. Carbajal campaigned on creating cooperation between Republicans and Democrats to support the Central Valley.</p>\n<p>He pledged to advocate for the middle class, fight for environmental protection, push for safer gun laws and regulations, help to make higher education more affordable, create higher-paying job opportunities and strengthen Medicare and social security.</p>\n<p>He won against his opponent, Justin Fareed (R).</p>\n<p><strong>State Assembly 37th District Representative Monique Limón</strong></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native and Goleta resident Monique Limón won another term as representative of the 37th state assembly district. She campaigned on her years of experience in higher education, especially at UCSB working in various departments to increase diversity and assist in transitions from college to graduate school.</p>\n<p>She promised to advocate for education, defend the environment and expand opportunities for job training and internships, according to her campaign websites.</p>\n<p>She won the majority in a landslide vote against her opponent, David Norrdin (D).</p>\n<p><strong>Goleta Union School District</strong></p>\n<p>Luz Reyes-Martin, Richard Mayer and Carin Ezal all won seats in the Goleta Union School District race.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure G2018 County Ordinance</strong></p>\n<p>Measure G proposed a redistricting of Santa Barbara County which would be spearheaded by the Santa Barbara Citizens’ Independent Redistricting Commission. The measure will establish clear procedures for determining electoral district boundaries within the county.</p>\n<p>The commission leading the redistricting will be designed to be free of influence from campaign contributors, political parties, special financial interests and more as well as be representative of diversity in the county.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure Z2018 City Goleta Cannabis Tax</strong></p>\n<p>Measure Z passed overwhelmingly in the midterm elections, placing a tax on cannabis businesses in Goleta to provide revenue to be used by the city of Goleta.</p>\n<p>The measure will impose taxes on individual processes of the cannabis industry in Goleta, including cannabis distribution/transportation, cannabis cultivation and cannabis processing/manufacturing. It will exclude the sale of medical cannabis and cannabis testing.</p>\n<p>The tax is expected to go into effect 10 days after the vote is declared by the city council, according to the Measure Z ordinance.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [Nov. 21]: Luz Reyes-Martin, Richard Mayer and Carin Ezal all won seats within the Goleta Union School District.

The board motioned to authorize the general manager to request funding from the university to cover the program.</p>\n<p>The finalization of the MOU encountered a minor hurdle during the meeting due to concerns about the contract phrasing which stipulated the investigator “be the primary point of contact for all such investigations occurring within the boundaries of the District.”</p>\n<p>A representative from the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) who was present during the meeting reported that the language in the MOU would create an interference with services and jurisdiction of the SBSO.</p>\n<p>“We just need to work through this to make sure we are not subverting the primary jurisdiction of the Sheriff and that we are not supplanting the services that are already provided by the Sheriff as it relates to these investigations,” he said.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) Director Brianna Conway countered their concerns, saying the inclusion of the term “primary point of contact” provided an essential element to the position of the investigator.</p>\n<p>“What that does is tell survivors that the first person they tell [their] story to is gonna be the person that stays with [their] case throughout the duration… and really provide that continuity in care in that response,” Conway said during the public comment period.</p>\n<p>Several I.V. CSD directors agreed with Conway’s suggestions, adding that these were consistent with the intended model of the program.</p>\n<p>However, UCPD would be in charge of implementation of such policy practices during the operalization of the investigator position, according to I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand.</p>\n<p>Several organizations have pushed for the implementation of an interpersonal violence investigator in I.V., including Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), C.A.R.E, UCPD and the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Members of SASA who were present at Tuesday’s meeting were glad to see the fulfillment of a program that was under discussion for over a year.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a long conversation… We’re very happy to see that the needs to the community and the need for the localization of the resource being finally represented in the MOU,” SASA President Emily Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand also expressed similar sentiments of both hope and happiness at the long-awaited implementation of an interpersonal violence survivor service in Isla Vista</p>\n<p>“This will be successful. This is really about serving our community, making it a safer place and us, Isla Vista’s local government, saying that we believe survivors, that we stand with survivors and that time’s up,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Right before making the official motion to finalize the contract, Bertrand recounted the I.V. CSD’s first meeting, in which an attendee shared her experience of being a survivor of sexual assault in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The most important comment that I heard that night was… about the experiences of so many survivors in this community and it’s those experiences that really make me happy that we’re taking this action here,” Bertrand said, tearing up during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“There’s too many people getting hurt in this community. There’s no perfect way to solve it but this is a really good step and I’m just grateful that we’re taking it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD postponed the decision on whether or not to include a low-income exemption with the UUT. <em>Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>I.V. voters passed the User Utility Tax (UUT) through Measure R, which was on the Santa Barbara Spring 2018 elections ballot.</p>\n<p>The UUT, an eight percent tax on electricity, gas, garbage disposal, sewage and water services, is the I.V. Community Services District’s main source of funding. It will <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19_5ItKDEy3CwUFvd-mRuIuIww-VKa3cwgk4pOAD35sM/edit#gid=1092095724\">net</a> approximately $777,000 a year for the district.</p>\n<p>The “Yes on Measure R” crew championed the tax as a way to finally give I.V. residents a voice in government following the district’s creation in Spring 2017.</p>\n<p>Prominent advocates for the tax – including I.V. CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand and I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud – campaigned on the promise of a low-income exemption for those who cannot afford the tax.</p>\n<p>Four months later, that promise remains in stasis.</p>\n<p>Brandt told the Nexus in June that the CSD was currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said in June.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD, which meets twice a month, has discussed the low-income exemption extensively at two of its meetings since UUT’s passing.</p>\n<p>However, the six-member board has not made any progress regarding the exemption and instead has discussed not implementing a low-income exemption for the tax.</p>\n<p>“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members, such as Vice President Natalie Jordan, said it is hard to determine which households in I.V. are low-income because several households only have one name on certain utilities.</p>\n<p>She pointed to her own living situation in I.V. as an example.</p>\n<p>“[My household] receive[s] a discounted rate on electricity already because we have that one [low-income] person written onto the bill,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Other members, such as director Father Jon Hedges, argued all residents should pay the tax because of the voice the I.V. CSD gives the community.</p>\n<p>“The whole premise of the CSD was participatory democracy, a voice for our community, that we not be voiceless the way we’ve been for decades,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that the cost of a small bill per month is a small price to pay.”</p>\n<p>The issue on the table during the Oct. 9 meeting was whether or not to exempt I.V.’s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vQhq8YjtkADsaqdHp8X7JumSONytqJPNLKQdu_csyms/edit#gid=0\">non-profit</a> housing providers, such as Friendship Manor and the SB Housing Co-op. The latter is composed of five houses: Newman, Merton, Bike, Manely and De Shain.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Director George Thurlow argued if one group is allowed to be exempt, such as the non-profits, then it would create problems for everyone.</p>\n<p>“Once we say, ‘Your folks don’t have to pay the four dollars a month,’ you’re gonna open the floodgates, because every student in this town is for [the exemption],” he said.</p>\n<p>The issue was tabled until February 2019, when the district will have a better sense of its finances, according to Hedges.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD is working toward “some sort of exemption or reduction,” though not necessarily a low-income exemption, Bertrand said to the Nexus following the meeting.</p>\n<p>“I wish we would address it now, but we can address it then, too,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“I struggle with this one because while [there is a] small amount of money that would be saved, it’s still something that we really — for the past few years now — mentioned some sort of utility reduction or exemption for low-income folks.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The final quote is attributed Bertrand, not Brandt. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Carbajal is a co-sponsor for the Keep Families Together Act. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The facility is located approximately 45 minutes away from El Paso, Texas, and houses 319 children ages 13 to 17, according to Carbajal. The children originate predominantly from Guatemala and then Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico respectively.</p>\n<p>The detention center is operated by a private contractor, <a href=\"https://discoverbcfs.net\">BCFS</a>, which is a “global system of health and human service nonprofit organizations with locations and programs across the U.S. and abroad,” according to the corporation’s website.</p>\n<p>While Carbajal said he believes the contractor is providing a “basic level of care,” he argued that it is not the right approach to this “self-imposed, developed crisis.”</p>\n<p>“They’re woken up at 5 a.m. after they were incarcerated and regimented, they’re rushed to showers and given less than five minutes at most,” Carbajal said in an interview with the Nexus. “Because this facility is in the desert, they’re only given 10-20 minutes of recreation once or twice a day.”</p>\n<p>“So clearly, these are not optimal, adequate conditions for children,” he added.</p>\n<p>He also noted there didn’t seem to be a clear system for children to file complaints regarding assault or other grievances.</p>\n<p>Among the 319 children being housed at this facility, 26 have been separated from their families, Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Although Carbajal is an original co-sponsor for the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3036/text\">Keep Families Together Act</a> within the House of Representatives, which puts limitations on the separation of families and sets deadlines for reunification, he said he is not hopeful about the likelihood of it passing due to the Republican control of the House, Senate and White House.</p>\n<p>While U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw ordered on Tuesday that the process of family separations be ended and that children be reunited with their families within 30 days, Carbajal said he has not seen any concrete plans to do so.</p>\n<p>“This administration is now saying that they are going to reunite children but haven’t provided a shred of evidence or detail as to how they’re gonna go about doing that,” he said. “There’s a conflict of data between the Department of Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Department of the custody of children. How many of them are there? Where are they? How are they going to reunite them? It’s all a big question mark.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal also visited the United States port of entry in El Paso and questioned Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers about the current procedures in place for migrants who come to the border seeking asylum.</p>\n<p>Carbajal was disappointed by the lack of information he was provided, stating that he questioned the officers “without sufficient answers.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The answers you’re seeking, I was seeking, and clearly they’re not providing them,” he said.</span></p>\n<p>Carbajal said he was told by the CBP and the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (I.C.E.) officials that children were being kept at a facility at the border — not Tornillo — for longer than the three-day limit due to the lack of coordination between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Health and Human Services Department (HHS).</p>\n<p>“They’re violating the human rights of these children based on U.S. law. And the I.C.E. officials admitted that to me,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>The presence of I.C.E. has been criticized at UC Santa Barbara — specifically, the compliance of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) under Sheriff Bill Brown with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">publicly positioned himself</a> against Senate Bill 54, which designates that local and state law agencies not work with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Amidst calls to abolish I.C.E., Carbajal said he stands for stricter “oversight and inquiry” of the agency’s enforcement actions and says I.C.E. “indiscriminately” targets undocumented individuals rather than individuals who have committed serious crimes.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the abolishment of I.C.E…. this is a larger conversation,” he said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal instead argues that the current immigration system needs to be comprehensively reformed on a national level, calling the current system “broken.” Only after this reformation will all the issues that fall under the umbrella of illegal immigration be addressed and resolved, he said.</p>\n<p>“I’m an immigrant myself. I immigrated to this country when the immigration system worked better.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal commends the individuals who are speaking out about their “discontent and their opposition” ahead of the Families Belong Together march planned for Saturday at 11 a.m. in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We need to stay vigilant, and make sure that we press this administration. The reason they’re modifying this policy a little bit is because there’s been public outrage throughout the country, and people should continue to express themselves,” Carbajal said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
