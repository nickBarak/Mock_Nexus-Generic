dining switch to delivery or takeout services and that any planned St. Patrick’s Day celebrations be canceled. All grocery stores, markets and food banks will remain open, as they provide “critical services to the community,” according to the department’s press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While many bars, nightclubs and pubs traditionally hold events for St. Patrick’s Day, these are particularly dangerous at this point in the coronavirus pandemic, as they could result in widespread transmission of the disease in Santa Barbara County,” the department’s press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elliot Spechler, a general manager at Baja Sharkeez, a downtown bar and nightclub frequented by UC Santa Barbara students, said he first heard about the new restriction on Sunday, when California Governor Gavin Newsom </span><a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article241212146.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bars, wineries, nightclubs and breweries within the state to shut down operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, Baja Sharkeez is open and will remain open “until they come down and ask us to close,” Spechler said. Along with removing “half of our chairs and barstools,” Spechler said that Baja Sharkeez is making other sanitary adjustments as well, such as following the six-feet social distancing rule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have procedures sent down from our corporate offices that we’re following as employees and staff, just to make sure that we’re keeping [everything] as sanitary and clean as possible,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the restaurant has no plans as of now to shutter its doors, Spechler maintained that a new mandate could change the situation entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re gonna take it hour by hour,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Study Hall, one of two bars in Isla Vista, could not be reached for comment.

Monday evening. </span></p>\n<p>Public Health Department officials also <a href=\"https://publichealthsbc.org/covid19/second-positive-case-of-covid-19-confirmed-in-santa-barbara-county/\">announced</a> Tuesday morning that a second person within the county has been diagnosed

Comer, director of SBC Public Health Microbiology Laboratory,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henning Ansorg, SBC public health officer in the Public Health Department, to elaborate on how the county is responding to the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would like to have everyone tested, but unfortunately, at the moment, we just cannot afford it. I’m looking forward to the next week or 10 days when we have a much better capability [for testing],” Ansorg said. “I urge people to understand that this is not in our hands. Nationwide, there are low shortages of important ingredients in these test kits.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg explained that the county has created a priority tier system for those who need to be currently tested.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Tier 1 are the “most vulnerable,” such as elderly individuals in senior residential facilities and nursing homes, as well as health care workers such as doctors and nurses, whose services are “critical.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tier 2 is composed of severely ill people, cases “where it would make a big difference if they are diagnosed early.” In Tier 3, the lowest category, are people who are “very mildly ill.” Those classified in Tier 3 should isolate themselves until they are fever free for three days, Ansorg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panel members noted they’ve seen a number of questions from community members about how the virus is spread; Batson explained that the coronavirus is transmitted “via droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The coronavirus is] unlike other airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis that don’t weigh as much … Whenever someone coughs, the droplet can typically only go three feet,” Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is one of the reasons we are encouraging social distancing because if you stay away from someone who is coughing and the droplet can only go three feet, then it is unlikely you would inhale the infectious droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the virus can also be transmitted by touching surfaces, which is why it is important for individuals to continually disinfect surfaces such as doorknobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg said that while currently the county has “more than enough” collection kits to be able to test symptomatic patients, more test kits will be available as “more labs are coming online.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comer clarified that between the Cottage Hospital system and private offices, there are over 1,700 coronavirus testing kits. Van Do-Reynoso said that “to the best of our knowledge, [getting tested] is very affordable because it is free. There is no cost-sharing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you feel like you’re coming down with a sore throat, nasal congestion, a cough, a fever, please consider yourself a potential case. I don’t mean this in order to make people afraid, but take this seriously,” Ansong said. “Do not go to work. Do not mingle with people. Stay isolated and take care of yourself.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [March 17, 2:56 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race for the 3rd District supervisor seat saw a close start between incumbent Joan Hartmann, a registered Democrat and challenger Bruce Porter, who ran with no party in the recent election. The vote-by-mail and mailed ballot results showed Hartmann and Porter nearly tied, with 43.79% and 43.34% of the vote, respectively. Karen Jones lagged behind, with 7.78% of the vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know that as a general rule, Republicans and conservatives vote early and vote by mail. So the fact that I was not behind was a very good [start] for the rest of the [race],” Hartmann said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the early tie, Porter said, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were deeply gratified and honored by the support we’ve received in early results. We believe that our message of Independence and commitment to bringing a new voice to all residents resonated deeply with voters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the night went on and precincts began reporting results, Hartmann gained a strong lead as Porter began to fall behind. With 21 of the 49 precincts reporting as of midnight on March 4, Hartmann had 51.77% of the vote, Porter had 35.81% and Jones followed with 6.8%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the county released the semi-official results, Hartmann maintained her lead with 52.26% of the vote, while Porter stayed behind with 35.71%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until the official certified results are released by the Santa Barbara County Elections Division, there is the possibility of the vote continuing to the November general election. For Hartmann to clinch the 3rd District supervisor seat, she must receive 50% plus one of the votes in the primary election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With over 30,000 ballots still to be tallied county-wide, it’s too soon to draw any definite conclusions from the current totals,” Porter said in a statement courtesy of Mathew Burciaga, Porter’s communications director. “The Porter for Supervisor campaign is looking forward to seeing the final results and is preparing for a lively general election in November.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race for the State Assembly seat of the 37th District started and ended with an unwavering  lead, held by lone Republican Charles Cole, who started off with 36.27% of the vote of the vote-by-mail and mailed ballot results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara City Mayor Cathy Murillo followed with 22.44% of the vote, Steve Bennett with 16.82% and Jason Dominguez with 8.68%. Elsa Granados had 5.81% of the vote, Jonathan Abboud had 5.75% and Stephen Blum had 3.89%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all precincts reporting, Cole ended the night with 32.15% of the vote. Abboud, general manager of the Isla Vista Community Services District and longtime resident of I.V., fell behind with 6.89% of the semi-final vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re proud of our campaign staff and volunteers and supporters for running a really strong campaign,” Abboud said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we probably did not make the runoff, I’m not going to stop advocating for and working on the issues I ran on, that no other candidate did, like tuition-free public college, the Green New Deal to combat climate change and inequality and affordable housing … The campaign was always about the issues that were not being talked about, not about me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann supported Abboud’s campaign and echoed his sentiments for future plans. “Working with communities to identify their goals and then developing strategies to accomplish those goals. So for I.V. maybe a Green New Deal, you know, how do we bring that about?” Hartmann said. “How do we clearly get better quality housing in I.V. and get the university to build the housing?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the race for State Senator of the 19th District, Democrat Monique Limón and Republican Gary Michaels advanced to a runoff in the November general election, with 56.4% and 38.09% of the vote, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, in the race for House Representative of the 24th District, Democrat Salud Carbajal and Republican Andy Caldwell will also advance to a runoff.

The discussion touched on a variety of topics relating to cannabis, but primarily served as an additional step in the community involvement process leading to the opening of a dispensary in I.V. in about a year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two speakers were UCSB alumni Lauren Vazquez, a lawyer specializing in cannabis law, and Devon Wardlow, director of public affairs for Santa Barbara cannabis retailer Coastal Dispensary. They spoke extensively about cannabis use in I.V., noting that the next step toward bringing a recreational dispensary in I.V. is through community outreach.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vasquez explained that because the licensing process in I.V. for recreational dispensaries is ranked, community impact counts as the second most important factor in the ranking process. The financial viability of the business is ranked first, but Santa Barbara County is using a merit-based system to determine which businesses get the recreational marijuana licenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county will be holding a meeting in I.V. within the coming months to gauge input from the community — specifically what residents would like out of a local dispensary and how the dispensary would contribute to improving the community, according to Vazquez. The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for the end of April, according to Gina Fischer, an aide to Santa Barbara county supervisor Joan Hartmann.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow said that Coastal Dispensary, which already has locations in Lompoc, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara, is going to compete for the spot in I.V. and is putting together a community benefits package for the dispensary’s pitch based off of the feedback she gets from talking to I.V. residents. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You guys have a ton of power in ensuring that somebody that comes to this community actually represents your community, and it’s actually going to do something helpful for you,” she said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow said she couldn’t discuss certain details of the potential community benefits package due to the ongoing licensing process, but added that she believes a dispensary could benefit the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The way I would propose it is that a portion of the cannabis taxes and revenue that comes from this store is funneled back into Isla Vista versus going into the general fund at the county,” Wardlow said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Wardlow acknowledged that appropriating the dispensary’s funds away from the county and into the I.V. CSD would be difficult, and that all current plans Coastal Dispensary has regarding its community benefits package are subject to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said that he can not comment on any ideas from the competing dispensaries regarding their community benefits packages, he added that he believes that the upcoming cannabis store will aid I.V.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’ll be a huge benefit to the community to have an additional revenue source because that’s money that should go right back into things that will fund our community facilities and programming for students and residents, our roads, sidewalks and street lights and our local schools,” Brandt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ellie Hurtado, a fourth-year communication major and president of SSDP, said that she’d like the tax revenue from a dispensary to go toward helping I.V. families, as well as students who experience food and housing insecurity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she would like to see more money for local youth programs such as the St. George Youth Center YMCA.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hurtado noted that while recreational cannabis is both legal and accessible for Isla Vistans who are 21 years old and older, with many residents ordering from dispensaries in Goleta and downtown Santa Barbara, the primary impact of a local dispensary would be the tax revenue it generates. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista has the opportunity through the county to be a really shining star in a larger ecosystem that is the central coast cannabis industry,” Wardlow said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Carbajal is running for a third term re-election for the seat he first won in 2016. He currently serves on the House Committee on Armed Services, the House Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, of which he serves as the vice chair. Carbajal has sponsored 231 bills since his inauguration in 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UCSB graduate, Carbajal previously served for 12 years as the Santa Barbara County 1st District Supervisor. One of Carbajal’s main issues is environmental protection; he serves on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate Solutions Caucus, which aims to find bipartisan solutions for mitigating the effects of climate change. Carbjal has also been a strong supporter of pro-immigration legislation, fighting against the Trump administration’s decision to terminate DACA. </span></p>\n<p><b>Andrew Caldwell (Republican):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Caldwell’s campaign is centered on providing better opportunities for workers and small businesses. In 1991, he founded the Coalition of Labor, Agriculture and Business (COLAB), which now has 1,000 members in Santa Barbara County. He has also helped start similar COLAB groups in Imperial, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties. While Caldwell is running as a Republican, he told the Santa Maria Times in February that neither party is serving the needs of the people and that he would “represent the people here.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Kenneth Young (No Party Preference): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young’s background is in civil engineering. According to his website, two issues that prompted him to run for office are health care and tax issues. He believes that Congress needs to lower costs for working families in order to maintain a healthy workforce in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue Young has put at the forefront of his campaign is energy independence; he said he believes the United States should invest more funding in renewable energy research and find safer ways of dealing with nuclear waste rather than eliminating nuclear power altogether. </span></p>\n<h2><b>State Assembly:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Charles W. Cole (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cole, the sole Republican candidate running for State Assembly and the youngest among all candidates at 22, is running on a conservative platform that includes fixing freeways, preserving Proposition 13, maintaining private health care and rolling back rent control, according to his campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born and raised in Santa Barbara, Cole graduated from Santa Barbara High School and attended Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) to study business, but left after his first year after he found “the PC culture not conducive to learning,” according to his campaign website. His father manages his campaign, which has roughly $10,000 in donations from friends and family. He currently works for a local PR business, according to a Noozhawk</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Elsa Granados (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados, executive director of the nonprofit Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, is running on a three-fold platform that includes social equality advocacy, women’s rights advocacy and preserving the environment and coastlines along the Central Coast, according to her campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If she wins the seat, Granados told the Santa Maria Times that she would work to increase affordable housing, create more jobs, strengthen the education systems within the district and stop offshore drilling.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Abboud (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A longtime UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista community member,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud, the youngest Democrat in the race for assembly, is the current general manager for the Isla Vista Community Services District and board member on the SBCC Board of Trustees.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud is running on a platform of education reform and free tuition, universal health care, affordable housing and public transportation, criminal justice reform and support for indigeneous communities, according to his campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cathy Murillo (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current Santa Barbara City mayor, a former journalist and city councilmember, Murillo is running on a platform that aims to preserve the environment, increase access to higher education and strengthen the middle class, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first term as the mayor of Santa Barbara, Murillo worked to ban single-use plastics, set a 100% renewable energy goal by 2030 and continued to employ integrated pest management in the city. She also negotiated a project labor agreement with the city for worker safety and fair pay, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Jason Dominguez (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez is bringing his experience as an environmental lawyer and a former teacher to his campaign, advocating for greater response to climate change, according to his website. Dominguez has previously served as a Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney and Deputy City Attorney, and he has been on Santa Barbara City Council since 2015. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez was originally running for Assembly at the same time as re-election for the Santa Barbara City Council but lost the election in December 2019. If elected, he plans to expand his work from City Council on inclusionary housing and wants to create a rent-to-own program for tenants. </span></p>\n<p><b>Steve Bennett (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Supervisor Bennett is finishing his fifth term on the board; before that, he worked as a high school teacher and member of the Ventura City Council. One of his hallmark initiatives of the County Board of Supervisors is S.O.A.R., the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources initiative, which was recently re-ratified. Other key issues for Bennett include building affordable housing and alternative transportation, such as coastal bikeways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bennett recently received the endorsement of the Santa Barbara Independent, who said he “holds the dramatic edge of experience” and will advocate for environmental protection. </span></p>\n<p><b>Stephen Blum (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describing himself as a “proud product of public schools,” Blum was a teacher for over 20 years before he served on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Community College District Board of Trustees and California Community College League State Board. Blum is basing his campaign on small donors and not accepting donations over $100 from any individuals or groups in what he calls a “positive only” campaign, he said on his website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Dawn Addis (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addis serves on the Morro Bay City Council and said on her website that her work as a mother, public educator and community organizer guides her actions. She is supportive of climate crisis legislation, aiming to address the climate crisis by expanding clean renewable energy sources. She also aims to increase jobs and small business growth, according to her campaign’s Facebook page. </span></p>\n<h2><b>3rd District Supervisor:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Joan Hartmann </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Democrat): As the incumbent, Hartmann has been serving as the 3rd District representative — which contains Isla Vista, parts of Goleta, the Gaviota Coast and Santa Ynez — </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since 2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and has been a strong advocate for climate change legislation. Isla Vista counts for nearly a third of the population living within the district.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, Hartmann discussed how the Santa Barbara oil spill inspired her to enter into academia, then law and then into the role of Supervisor. She placed importance on UCSB faculty housing, said she is a “huge supporter” of unionized labor and supports regulated cannabis within the county. She has also worked with several members of the Isla Vista Community Services District, supported the creation of the district and has been endorsed by several directors as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>Bruce Porter: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Porter’s second time running for the 3rd District seat. He is running on a platform of investing in alternative energy, “[restoring] balance to county government,” reinvesting in public schools and implementing a “common sense” cannabis policy, according to </span><a href=\"http://bruceporter.org/priorities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter has faced significant backlash in the past few months from Isla Vista residents and UCSB students for his alleged role in the creation of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/rock-the-vote-sb-declared-illegitimate-by-national-org-shuts-down-operations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an organization that allegedly was created to tip the scales in the supervisor race by causing low voter turnout. He did not attend the Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, bowing out of the forum four hours before it was set to begin, citing mismanagement on the part of the forum’s organizers. </span></p>\n<p><b>Karen Jones (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Jones’ second time running for the 3rd District seat, and she currently serves as a director on the Santa Ynez Community Services District.

Senate </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/senate-passes-resolution-opposing-cat-canyon-drilling-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">voted in November 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to oppose. She also prides herself on only accepting small donations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Tuesday night’s Isla Vista town hall, she emphasized her identity as the “only native-born, only Republican” in the race. When asked about the UC COLA movements, she said that she is not a fan of organized labor and said she believes that salaries can be negotiated and worked out without a union. She added that she believes that marijuana should be legalized, but not controlled by the government. </span></p>\n<h2><b>State Senator: </b></h2>\n<p><b>Monique Lim</b><b>ó</b><b>n (Democrat):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Lim</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ón currently is in her second term as an assembly member in the California Legislature.

I.V. composes nearly a third of the population within the 3rd District. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 3rd District supervisor is typically a tie-breaking position on the board, with two left-leaning zones to the south and two conservative ones to the north. Hartmann is running as a nonpartisan candidate; Jones is running as a Republican. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race’s third candidate, Bruce Porter, who also ran against Hartmann in 2016, did not attend the town hall. His campaign released a statement Tuesday afternoon requesting the town hall be rescheduled due to a “lack of communication among the organizers,” which includes Associated Students Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs (A.S. EVPLA), Movement for Intersectional Collective Action (MICA), the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Center, Gauchos Vote and the Beloved Community Isla Vista</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christian Ornelas, the EVPLA, and Diana Garcia, an organizer with MICA, responded to Porter through a statement sent out later that afternoon, saying that while they would not be rescheduling the event, they were “very open to hosting another town hall event” that includes Porter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter also later said in a press release that he plans on hosting a separate town hall in I.V. next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Porter was not present at Tuesday’s town hall, his absence loomed over the event, as both Hartmann and Jones commented on his lack of presence.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Tonight, Bruce Porter was going to tell you that he cares about you,” Hartmann told the crowd at the end of her opening statement. “But he didn’t show up.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He bragged to his supporters about the 1,400 fewer students registered in I.V. [in 2016]. He only got 20% of the vote in I.V.; I got 80%,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Hartmann and Jones disagreed across the board on a variety of topics, at the heart of their differences are their career paths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the incumbent, Hartmann emphasized her ongoing political experience with the Board of Supervisors and the projects she has spearheaded over the past four years since her election in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones, on the other hand, positioned herself as a political outsider, emphasizing the deregulation of private businesses as one of her main platform points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Joan and I have very different approaches to things, and the people who trust me are my friends and neighbors,” Jones said, repeatedly bringing up her working-class experience and lack of a college education throughout the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Joan has spent a lifetime working in government and she’s met some really educated, neat people like herself, but they really are not the experts on innovation or the private sector.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates also addressed issues relating to climate change and renewable energy;  Hartmann extensively spoke about her pro-environmental record and her goal to transition Santa Barbara to clean, renewable energy sources.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sustainable, renewable, predictably priced energy will be very important [for the economy],” she said, adding that clean energy would work as an appeal to bring larger companies to the northern county, both creating additional jobs and helping the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann also discussed current composting groups and efforts to ban single-use plastics on campus and in I.V. as an initiative the county could also adopt to become environmentally friendly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones did not shy away from her pro-fossil fuel stance and her own family’s connection to the oil industry in the northern county, which she views as a job creator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Hartmann] talks about S.T.E.M. jobs, this is it. I mean fossil fuel production, those involve S.T.E.M. jobs, that’s not just a bunch of meatheads doing that. These are very sophisticated jobs,” Jones said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fossil fuels are solar energy; that is stored solar energy, folks. That is through photosynthesis. The breakdown of plants become oil and we harvest it now for energy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the issue of affordable housing, both candidates agreed there is a need for additional workforce housing, particularly in I.V., but differed on what the solution would look like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones proposed cutting down taxes and reducing government regulations to make room for smaller developers to build more housing in the county. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can’t always keep fitting more rats in the aquarium,” Jones said, referring to the spike in UCSB’s student population over the years without a comparable increase in housing options. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones suggested that prospective university students should consider initially forgoing higher education in order to decrease local housing prices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann noted that the price of rent in Santa Barbara has increased three times faster than the cost of living and said she was “working hard to force the university to follow through on their required mandate” from the state to build more housing for faculty and students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates also addressed the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost-of-living</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> adjustment (COLA) movements by graduate students at UCSB and in the larger UC system, which Hartmann said she supports. Jones said that she hopes the graduate students can work out a deal with the university but added that she dislikes using union tactics to do so. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two candidates also provided drastically different opinions on the topic of equity and diversity in I.V. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also believe that our institutions must do everything they can to promote diversity and inclusion,” Hartmann said. “When I was a graduate student, I was the only woman in my class and there were no women professors at my graduate school.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones responded, saying, “I don’t see color, I don’t see sexual orientation, I don’t even see sex,” and believes that no group should gain “special” rights. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she is “the only local person that is native-born, married to a guy who was born in the 3rd District.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another topic affecting both I.V. and the county as a whole is the legalization and regulation of recreational cannabis. Hartmann said she has worked to change county-wide legislation from a lottery to merit-based system when issuing cannabis dispensary licenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People [have] said to me, ‘Hell no, we don’t want [a lottery system]. You go back and change the county’s mind because we want a merit-based system.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann said that she’ll be back in I.V. in the spring to hold a community meeting for residents to discuss what they want in an ideal cannabis dispensary applicant, and from there, will use that input to assess which applicant will fit the goals and needs of I.V. residents, a process that will “differ by community” across the county.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said she favors private businesses and deregulation in the cannabis industry and said she believes regulations get in the way of small businesses, like cannabis dispensaries, from operating. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann argued that county regulation of the cannabis industry was necessary, saying that without regulation, cannabis “can be quite contaminated and create a lot of problems for people in our county.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones acknowledged in her closing statement that, as a Republican, she is unlikely to win many votes in I.V., but encouraged the crowd — some of whom occasionally heckled her during the event — to vote and advance her instead of Porter to the November ballot against Hartmann.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the previous race for the seat in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hartmann won 53.96% of the district votes, beating out Porter’s 45.79%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can get your friends and classmates to vote for me and it will not jeopardize Joan’s chances at all,” Jones said. “It will give her somebody that is a worthy opponent.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her closing statement, Hartmann reiterated her positions stated during the town hall along with some of the endorsements she received, including one from the recently withdrawn candidate, Jessica Alvarez Parfrey.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will continue to lead the just transition to a green energy economy with environmental and economic benefits, I will support a more representative and inclusive county government, I will fight for progressive causes including workers’ rights and environmental justice and I will protect your safety, our water resources, our open spaces and our climate,” Hartmann said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Thomas Anderle, according to Unander, who advised the plaintiffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander, who has been with the Legal Resource Center since 2003, said that across the 18 cases, the total amount sought from the management company was $24,215. Of that, the plaintiffs received $13,785 back in money initially put into security deposits and $1,200 in “bad faith” charges — meaning the plaintiffs proved the management company had acted in violation of an agreement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander emphasized that from her perspective, the owners of Isla Vista Luxury Living hadn’t acted in a malicious manner </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they just “clearly didn’t have a handle on the law the way they thought they did,” and that these cases were “a real education for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this landlord learned a lot in the three days we were in court,” she said. “They didn’t consider that they were abusing the tenants’ deposits. They really felt they were entitled to take what they took.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 12 properties listed on the Isla Vista Luxury Living website: 760 Embarcadero Del Norte, 6656 Picasso, 6659 Abrego , 6599 Madrid, 6565 Segovia, 6629 Sabado Tarde, 910 Camino Pescadero, 897 Camino Del Sur, 6578 Trigo, 6510 Sabado Tarde, 6508 Seville and 6517 El Greco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Luxury Living was created in July 2018, according to California business records. Its owners are Bijan Moshayedi and his father, Mike, who currently resides in Newport Beach; according to Unander and several of the tenants who spoke to the Nexus, a man named Keenan Duran serves as the properties’ manager. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, it was during Spring Quarter 2019 and the beginning of summer that the Isla Vista Tenants Union saw an uptick in the number of people coming in. While the union typically sees an increase when leases end, she noticed that a large number of people were complaining about the same landlord: Isla Vista Luxury Living. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One tenant, Tyler Wells, created a Facebook group to help keep track of all the complaints; as of Thursday, the group has 92 members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past several months, tenants have posted complaints and concerns about I.V. Luxury Living to the group, including duplicate charges, not receiving receipts for work done, charges for what they believed to be normal wear and tear, alleged excess charges for painting and carpet cleaning, among others </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one plaintiff posted about a $120 billing charge he received for a broken toilet paper holder, and another said they were charged $45 to replace a lightbulb. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One plaintiff and member of the Facebook group, Natalie Mazmanian in the case of Mazmanian v. Isla Vista Luxury Living, told the Nexus that, among other charges she later disputed, she had been charged for a water filter in her apartment at 760 Embarcadero Del Norte </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a water filter that had never existed in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was more the principles than it was money, honestly,” Mazmanian told the Nexus. “It was a year [under their] management, and all we ever did was have problems … [Duran] had no sort of management skills coming into this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mazmanian was also charged $559 for a cleaning fee, $90 to replace two lights in the living room and for water damage for kitchen cabinets </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">water damage, she said, that was caused by the absence of a water filter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, the Moshayedis’ first property was acquired when Bijan was a student at UC Santa Barbara in 2009. Bijan’s name is attached to at least nine properties in the Santa Barbara area, according to Santa Barbara clerk recorder records. Mike’s is attached to at least one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada confirmed that someone with the name Bijan Moshayedi attended UCSB between Fall Quarter 2007 and Summer 2011. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bijan Moshayedi and Duran did not respond to requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, the Moshayedis created Isla Vista Luxury Living after splitting from its former management company, Meridian Group Real Estate, during the summer of 2018.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deedy Hedrick, a property supervisor for Meridian who managed the Moshayedis’ properties from 2014 to summer 2018, also testified in support of some of the plaintiffs, according to Unander. Hedrick testified in one case that the amount the plaintiffs were charged for cleaning was double than what was typically charged for “extra heavy cleaning,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the eight cases that went to trial, all received money back, although the amounts awarded varied. But in two cases </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pena et al v. Isla Vista Luxury Living and McBride et al v. Isla Vista Luxury Living </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judge Anderle found that the management company had acted in bad faith and awarded the plaintiffs the full security deposits plus additional compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Court spent hours on this case trying to ferret out what and why the events occurred,” Judge Anderle wrote in his decision in Pena v. Isla Vista Luxury Living. He stated that the management company had “vastly overcharged in this case” and that the plaintiffs did “everything that could be expected of tenants.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Plaintiffs] did a thorough job of documenting the move-in and move-out. On the other hand the Luxury Living documentation was cursory at best and irresponsible at worst,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pena, a Santa Barbara City College student who asked to be referred to only by her last name, explained that when she and her partner first moved into their apartment at 6565 Segovia, it was managed by Meridian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But once Isla Vista Luxury Living took over, she said the manager, Duran repeatedly ignored her requests for routine maintenance, even one request for him to fix the “staples or nails” coming out of the carpet. When it did come time to move out, the company did not return any of her deposit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she and her partner “took pictures of everything” and “had every [communication with Duran] in text,” which she said is likely why she was awarded the full security deposit plus additional compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In McBride v. Isla Vista Luxury Living, Judge Anderle awarded the plaintiffs their full security deposit back, as well as an additional $314, in part because Duran had “told the plaintiffs there were ‘no problems’ … leading them to conclude they would get their security deposit back.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judge added that there was nothing in the move-out report “that reflects any viable issues.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelsey McBride, a class of 2019 graduate, told the Nexus that when she moved out of her apartment, her and her roommates “cleaned for two days,” adding that “it was in better condition that when we moved in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But after they moved out, even though Duran had told McBride </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with her mother as a witness </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that her whole security deposit would be returned, they only received three quarters of what they had been told. They were also charged hundreds of dollars for carpet cleaning and painting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did nothing wrong,” McBride said. “They owed us money. We took action to get that money rightfully returned to us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of money settled by plaintiffs out of court was not ava</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ilable. Of the cases that went to trial, besides Pena’s and McBride’s, Judge Anderle awarded nearly all of them about half of what they sued for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the plaintiffs who talked to the Nexus stated they had only ever dealt with Duran and not the owners directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander hopes other Isla Vistans will see these cases and “stand up and do something” if their landlord is mistreating them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Landlords have become accustomed to the students basically complaining about things, but then doing nothing. The fact that we were able to coordinate 18 different units … that’s huge.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

</span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/assemblywoman_monique_limon_announces_candidacy_for_state_senate_20190921\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced this past

As assemblymember, Limón represents parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and has drafted up a number of California bills related to coastal resources, childcare and women’s issues, among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 27, Abboud is by far the youngest candidate to announce his candidacy for the seat so far. He began his political career as UC Santa Barbara’s Residential Housing Association (RHA) President during the 2012-2013 school year and the Associated Students (A.S.) </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/abboud-named-a-s-president-for-2013-14-as-opp-sweeps-elections/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">during the 2013-2014 school year. He graduated from UCSB in 2014 with a degree in political science and completed a master’s degree in technology management in 2017.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a long-term I.V. resident who has been in the college town since 2010, Abboud’s roots extend beyond the university; he was integral to the campaign that created Isla Vista’s first local government and secured funding for Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and has served as the government’s general manager since Nov. 2017. He also currently serves as a member of the Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees and has held the position since 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an interview that for the past five years, he’s been “working on strengthening democracy in my town,” referencing his work on the Measures E, F and R campaigns to create and fund the I.V. CSD respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve done a lot in the past nine years to contribute to the community and learn about state issues and engage with issues that affect the local and state level,” he said. “I want to take what I’ve learned of how democracy can be different here to the state level and take our values to apply to the whole state.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But his latest venture to the statewide level was brought on by “imminent issues” affecting all Californians, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He cited “continued divestment in education,” “climate change” and “strengthening our democracy” as reasons for why he has decided to enter the race now. He added that he is the “only candidate in the race right now who has experience in the education sector.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud did not list any concrete points he would tackle if elected, and declined to further elaborate on his platform, stating he is “getting [his] campaign organization together.” He also declined to name his campaign managers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My philosophy as a candidate is that we all prosper only when everyone prospers,” he said. “There’s a lot of work we need to do about strengthening our democracy and making sure people can fully participate.” </span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
