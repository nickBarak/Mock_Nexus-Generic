id=\"caption-attachment-75915\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of County of Santa Barbara</em></p></div>\n<p>The reservoir, which provides approximately 85 percent of the water for south county residents, now holds 82,011 acre-feet of water — a significant increase from the 34,576 acre-feet it held last Wednesday. This still accounts for less than half of the lake’s maximum storage: 193,305 acre-feet.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Flood Control District reported that the lake was at 17.9 percent capacity last week and at 7.3 percent capacity on Oct. 1 of last year.</p>\n<p>In light of the six-year statewide drought, the United States Bureau of Reclamation said in October 2015 that the Goleta Water District should “expect no new water from the lake.”</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District declared mandatory water use restrictions in May 2015 when it declared a Stage III Water Shortage Emergency with plans to reduce water usage by 35 percent across the district.</p>\n<p>This type of emergency is declared when the district’s water supply is 65 to 75 percent what it should normally be at that time of the year.</p>\n<p>Drought conditions may improve with recent rainfall, as Santa Barbara County is among the regions most affected by the recent drought period.</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties are the only areas still in an extreme drought stage, referred to as D3. The rest of the state is mostly in abnormally dry conditions, D0, with a large portion of Northern California no longer in drought.</p>\n<p>It is possible that Santa Barbara County could be lifted out of D3 range after last week’s rain spells.</p>\n<p>While the rain could offset the county’s drought, it also may cause potential infrastructure problems, as last week’s storm resulted in sinkholes, mudslides and severe flooding.</p>\n<p>Tom Fayram, deputy director of Water Resources at the Public Works Department in the county, said he is not concerned about the infrastructure at Cachuma Dam but recognized that last week’s intense rain could cause problems for roadways and flood control systems.</p>\n<p>“I have no concern over Cachuma Dam,” Fayram said. “If we get future rainfall of the magnitude of the rain we got just before last weekend, then we do have serious infrastructure concerns in terms of our transportation system, our roadways, our flood control system, [and] in terms of our channels and basins that do tend to be stressed in storms like that.”</p>\n<p>Fayram, whose department works in contracting the water from Lake Cachuma, said last week’s rains greatly contributed to the reservoir’s water supply, which will provide water to the entire south coast including Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“We still don’t know yet how much water actually will be available out of this,” Fayram said.  “There [are] a number of factors that go into it, but clearly this was a welcome shot in the arm, so to speak, of water that we just haven’t seen for the last five years.”</p>\n<p>As for how this rainfall will affect water restrictions in Goleta, KK Holland from the Goleta Water District said she is “cautiously optimistic” given the recent storm activity.</p>\n<p>“The Board is not currently considering additional restrictions,” Holland said in an email.<br>\nFayram said he welcomes the rain and capacity increase, but long-term solutions are necessary to solve the drought problem.</p>\n<p>“We still have a lake that’s at 50 percent capacity and can go back down to the same conditions we were in before,” Fayram said. “I don’t think that even filling the lake completely would solve our water supply issues because we started off with a lake in 2011 completely full, and five years of drought put us into a very dire situation.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

access to inmates’ personal information in the jail computers and databases, such as immigration status.</p>\n<p>While the Lobby Corps began the project last December, the Central Coast Immigration Rights Coalition (CCIRC) has been discussing I.C.E. with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) for the past three years. Bill Brown is the current Sheriff.</p>\n<p>In addition to the UCSB Lobby Corps, Santa Barbara City College, Allan Hancock College and Westmont College have been assisting CCIRC.</p>\n<p>According to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson, I.C.E. enforces immigration laws in the county and has a workspace in the county jail with access to inmates’ information.</p>\n<p>Jails, separate from prisons, are holding facilities used to confine people serving sentences for misdemeanors, awaiting trial or sentencing on either felony or misdemeanor charges or confined for civil matters.</p>\n<p>I.C.E. and jails work under the Truth Act, statewide legislation that creates more transparency in interactions between SBSO, I.C.E. and inmates.</p>\n<p>The Truth Act ensures that people in jail are aware of their rights to due process, legal counsel and that records relating to I.C.E. access must be open to the public.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if local law enforcement chooses to notify I.C.E. about an inmate’s release, the person and their attorney or designee must be notified of their release date and time as well.</p>\n<p>While organizations like CCIRC and Lobby Corps hope for an increase in strict enforcement of the Truth Act, they are lobbying to completely remove I.C.E. from prisons.</p>\n<p>Daniel Torres, a second-year history of public policy major and an organizer for Lobby Corps, said SBSO has been open about its “working relationship” with I.C.E., but said the Lobby Corps wants to “sever that connection” between the local jails and I.C.E.</p>\n<p>According to Frank Rodriguez, organizer of the Santa Barbara California Immigrant Policy Center which operates CCIRC, the county supervisors provide the funds and resources to the county jails.</p>\n<p>If CCIRC and the Lobby Corps can convince SBSO to limit I.C.E.’s work in the jails, county supervisors would then have the ability to restrict I.C.E.’s access to the jail’s computers and databases.</p>\n<p>Torres said the Lobby Corps and other organizations plan to work with Santa Barbara County Supervisors, and has already met with Fifth District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino to discuss the project.</p>\n<p>Lavagnino said, however, that although he disagrees with some immigration decisions made by the federal government, he believes immigration agents have an important role in county jails.</p>\n<p>“I thought everybody would agree that those that come to this country and have committed serious felonies, I thought everybody would approve of them being returned to their country,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Torres

bill “Statue of Liberty Values Act,” which aims to block federal funding for President Trump’s seven-nation immigration ban. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal has co-sponsored a bill that would defund President Donald Trump’s immigration ban, adding his name to a list of California legislators taking action against the executive order.</p>\n<p>Trump announced his travel ban last Friday, halting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the intake of refugees from Syria.</p>\n<p>Carbajal, who represents California’s 24th District, is co-sponsoring a bill introduced by California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren titled “Statue of Liberty Values (SOLVE) Act,” which would eradicate and block all federal funding for Trump’s executive order.</p>\n<p>“Our country’s safety and national security is paramount,” Carbajal stated in a press release on Monday. “President Trump’s overly broad executive order only serves to fuel anti-American sentiment and propaganda, putting our national security at risk.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, Carbajal believes the executive order “demonstrates dangerous and irresponsible leadership” because it “developed hastily” and was not thoroughly discussed with national security agencies.</p>\n<p>Tess Whittlesey, communications director for Congressman Carbajal, said the Senate majority is refusing to bring the bill to the floor for consideration because Republicans, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, are in favor of the president’s order.</p>\n<p>However, Whittlesey said it is “important to be a strong advocate” for immigrant communities, even if the bill does not move forward.</p>\n<p>“He’s here fighting for Central Coast values no matter what the odds are of legislation getting picked up,” Whittlesey said. “It’s what he believes in, and he’s going to keep fighting for those values here in Washington.”</p>\n<p>Austin Hechler, Associated Students (A.S.) president and fourth-year political science major, said Carbajal’s actions demonstrate how California is “extremely diverse and inclusive.”</p>\n<p>State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, chair of the California Senate Judiciary Committee, said she admires Carbajal’s sponsorship of the bill and his condemnation of Trump’s “outrageous behavior.”</p>\n<p>“Our system of government has checks and balances, and I think it’s critically important that the Congress, which is one of those checks and balances, does, in fact, do its job,” Jackson said. “I appreciate Congressman Carbajal … and I believe every congressmember willing to follow the Constitution and their oath of office should be doing the same.”</p>\n<p>The California Senate Judiciary Committee passed Senate Resolution 16 on Monday, which condemns Trump’s ban as a “discriminatory overreach” and urges the president to revoke the executive order. The resolution also asked the Department of Homeland Security to allow immigrant detainees access to legal counsel “as quickly as feasible.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the committee met Tuesday to discuss three bills that would provide legal assistance for immigrants facing deportation, outlaw local law enforcement from investigating someone based on immigration status and prohibit state agencies from disclosing a person’s religious affiliation to the federal government.</p>\n<p>Jackson said constituents have expressed concern to her about their safety, as some have been “terrorized by people who have been emboldened by [Trump’s] intolerance.”</p>\n<p>“The best way to deal with this would be to educate people,” Jackson said. “I don’t think that people are inherently unkind to each other. We need to teach and talk with each other and recognize the importance of kindness and compassion.”</p>\n<p>According to Whittlesey, the state Senate’s work to limit the power of the executive order in California, along with Carbajal’s support in Congress, foreshadows how California will respond in the future to contentious presidential orders.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re going to see California reacting to a lot of Trump’s policies going forward,” Whittlesey said. “We’re definitely going to be a face of resistance during the administration.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/","id":3916,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3915,3914,3913],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Despite Calif.

A series of sustained rains could be the only remedy for Southern California’s drought. <em> Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>For the past five years, Lake Cachuma has been shriveling in size as rain levels drop to historical lows, measured as the driest five years on record. Despite promises of heavy El Niño rains in 2016, the Santa Barbara area received only 70 percent of the expected precipitation, resulting in wildfires and rapidly diminishing reservoirs.</p>\n<p>Large amounts of rain at the beginning of 2017 left many hopeful for a swift end to California’s six-year drought. According to the Santa Barbara County Reservoir and Rainfall report, the county has received 135 percent of normal rainfall this year.</p>\n<p>Storms beginning this week may affect the drought classification in Santa Barbara; even large storms last week did not abate a D4 status which classifies Santa Barbara as in “exceptional drought.” The rest of the state, however, is down to two percent D4 conditions from over 18 percent.</p>\n<p>The National Weather Forecast estimated peak precipitation levels between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. the night of Jan. 18, when the county was projected to receive between 0.26 and 0.49 inches of rain. A second storm is expected to arrive Thursday evening and continue through mid-Friday with an estimated one to three inches of rain.</p>\n<p>The third and largest storm is expected to arrive Sunday, which at minimum will have as much precipitation as the storm before it.</p>\n<p>Tom Fayram, the deputy public works director for Santa Barbara County, said he feels “cautiously optimistic” about the upcoming storms’ effects on Lake Cachuma.</p>\n<p>“The drought’s not over, but a little bit of relief is good,” Fayram said. “We will see some inflow into Lake Cachuma; it stands to put water in the reservoir for the first time since 2011.”</p>\n<p>KK Holland, from the Goleta Water District, said, “The biggest potential impact will likely be not from local rainfall here, but an increased state water allocation due to the heavy rains in the northern part of the state.”</p>\n<p>Despite the seeming lack of impact, Holland said, the district is “obviously thrilled to see much needed rain.”</p>\n<p>The last drought report released Jan. 12 by the National Drought Mitigation Center showed “major changes were made” across California due to the increased precipitation this year, but water supply in Santa Barbara County still lags way below normal with a “measly” increase in Lake Cachuma.</p>\n<p>According to a report from the Santa Barbara County Flood Control District released last week, Lake Cachuma was over 753 feet in elevation in 2011, and it stored over 193,300 acre-feet of water.</p>\n<p>Today, Lake Cachuma is at 651.79 foot elevation and is storing 17,757 acre-feet of water.</p>\n<p>This is only 9.2 percent of capacity, which is 193,305 acre-feet. In order for Santa Barbara to move down to D3, which means the area is in “extreme drought,” there would need to be more hydrological impact on Lake Cachuma, which fulfills around half the water needs of the South Coast.</p>\n<p>David Miskus, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and author of last week’s drought report, said, as far as “hydrological improvement,” Santa Barbara is “not very affected.”</p>\n<p>Tim DeVries, an assistant professor in the UCSB geography department, said the county will need double the expected rainfall in 2017 and 2018 to offset the drought. The average rainfall in 2016 was half the expected average, meaning an end to the drought would require four times that value for the next two years.</p>\n<p>“This year, we got 18 inches of rain, and what we’d need is essentially two consecutive years of 30 inches of rain,” DeVries said. “Right now, we’re perhaps on track for that this year, it’s kind of too early to say.”</p>\n<p>Much of the status of the drought will be contingent on February, which has historically been California’s wettest month.</p>\n<p>Goleta Water District declared a Stage III Water Shortage Emergency in May 2015, with a target of decreasing water usage by 35 percent. The district has imposed restrictions on outdoor watering, agricultural water usage and mandates that hotels and other lodging post notices of water shortage.</p>\n<p>Conservation in Goleta to date has been around 27 percent, though for some months conservation has been as high as 40 percent, with “single family consumers” conserving the most.</p>\n<p>According to Holland, the rainfall totals to date for the year are eight inches for Goleta.</p>\n<p>“That isn’t enough to offset the previous years of below average rainfall,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We are still early in the rainy season and the watershed is so dry that until this last storm, there wasn’t enough rain to get any inflow into the lake.”</p>\n<p>There are five different water shortage stages, with stage one requesting voluntary conservation and stage two beginning to mandate conservation, especially of outdoor watering.</p>\n<p>Despite the large amounts of rain, Holland said she remains pessimistic about the future of Goleta.</p>\n<p>“The most recently released drought index shows the South Coast as one of the only remaining areas of the state to still be in exceptional drought,” she said in an email. “If anything, additional restrictions on outdoor watering may become necessary by summer.”</p>\n<p>It is unclear whether this drought is a symptom of human-caused climate change because of the relatively short time period; climate change is generally observed over the course of several decades.</p>\n<p>“If we go into a 30-year dry spell, then we can pretty much say, okay, this is climate change, this is not due to natural climate variability, this is human caused,” DeVries said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

orbit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing approximately 229 feet tall, the nine-engine rocket soared into a cloudless blue sky at 9:54 a.m., following weather delays due to heavy rains in the Central Coast this week and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an on-pad explosion during a scheduled test on Sep.1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The launch was the first of seven planned to commence over the next 18 months as Iridium Communications Inc. replaces their existing network of satellites spanning the globe. Once complete, the program will have replaced the entire Iridium satellite constellation, a feat Iridium describes as the largest “tech upgrade” in history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, and six years later it </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">became the first privately funded company to put a payload in Earth orbit</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. SpaceX Communications Director John Taylor said he couldn’t disclose the SpaceX CEO and founder’s location. He said, however, that either Musk or SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell are always on site in the launch control center.</span></p>\n<p>Whether on location or not, Musk was certainly monitoring the start of the program which SpaceX first embarked on eight years ago, evident by his Twitter feed throughout the launch procedures.</p>\n<p>At 11:05 a.m. he posted “Mission looks good. Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the droneship,” and later retweeted a photo of the Falcon 9 rocket safely docked on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship stationed in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"74838\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-15/spacex-launch-commences-groundbreaking-satellite-program-after-eight-years-in-development/spacex/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?fit=587%2C396&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"587,396\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"spacex\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?fit=587%2C396&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74838\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?resize=587%2C396\" alt=\"Twitter.com\" width=\"587\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?w=587&amp;ssl=1 587w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>The satellites were delivered into a “temporary parking orbit” at 625 km to be tested by Iridium in the weeks to come.

Trump supporters walked alongside the protest and listened to the speeches given by members of the march, observing the demonstration.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Correction: The closing prayer dances were Toltec/Aztec, not Chumash, and were performed by a mixed group of local dancers.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

The district as a whole registered around 9,600 more people this year than in the 2012 election.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista voter registration drives set a new record during the last week of October, registering over 13,000 new voters for the November election. Approximately 11,000 students were registered in 2012 and 10,800 were registered in 2010.</p>\n<p>UCSB leads other universities such as UCLA, which reported approximately 10,100 registered voters, USC, which registered a mere 411 students according to The Daily Bruin and UC San Diego, which reported around 3,000 registered voters according to the UCSD voter registration coalition.</p>\n<p>“They have done a better job of turnout in Isla Vista than I have ever seen, over 13,000 voters voted in Isla Vista today, and it’s because of the very, very hard work of these democrat activists,” Das Williams, supervisor elect, said.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara County, 60 percent of the presidential votes went to Secretary Clinton, 32 percent to Trump, 3.5 percent to Gary Johnson and 2 percent were write-ins. California is undeniably a liberal state, so higher voter turnout likely wouldn’t have changed any results here, but in other states voter turnout could have made all the difference in this pinnacle election.</p>\n<p>Millennials proved to be a major force in this year’s election. A photo from SurveyMonkey showing the country’s Electoral College votes if only millennials had voted went viral on Tuesday, with the large majority of them, 473 to be exact, going to Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Millennials supported Clinton with 54 percent of the youth vote, but many millennials are angry with rumors of thousands of young people writing in “Harambe” on their ballots or even for voting for third-party candidates. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported, “For the Democratic Party to move forward and win, young people — some of the party’s most vocal critics — cannot be shut out of what will be a rebuilding process.”</p>\n<p>The 3rd District County Board of Supervisors had a large turnout of 25,136 votes with Joan Hartmann leading Bruce Porter by 8 percent. The Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District had a total of 7,317 votes to reelect Pegeen Soutar as director of the District.</p>\n<p>Measures E and F had an underwhelming amount of voter turnout with approximately 4,150 votes on each measure. Measure E passed with a significant majority of 88 percent, but Measure F, which only 62 percent of people voted yes on, did not pass. If voter turnout had been even higher, perhaps Measure F would have gone through or results for various different offices could have been different.</p>\n<p>Though turnout was strong, an anonymous Campus Democrats volunteer said that word of mouth was that at 6 p.m. on Tuesday only half of registered voters in I.V. had actually voted.</p>\n<p>In 2008, national voter turnout was relatively high at 62.3 percent but dropped in 2012 to an estimated 57.5 percent. This year’s turnout, expected to level around 55.6 percent according to the U.S. Elections Project, shows a trend toward Americans across the country not casting their vote. Reasons for not voting range from being blocked or restricted, being too busy with work and/or childcare, to simply deciding not to vote on principle, according to The New York Times.</p>\n<p><em>A

Though a significant amount of the country voted to put a woman in the highest office in the land, others are more concerned about what the candidate’s policies were.</p>\n<p>Eileen Boris, professor in the Department of Feminist Studies at UCSB, said feminist leaders are necessary, and while the gender of the president is significant, it is more important for there to be a feminist, in particular, in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>“I think it makes more of a difference [if] we have a feminist in the White House … It makes more of a difference not the embodiment of the person but the policies of a person,” Professor Boris said.</p>\n<p>As for what particular policies a feminist would bring into office, Boris said, a feminist in office will bring a commitment to what is often called the ‘working family dilemma,’ that is, how do we organize the relationship between getting a living and daily life.”</p>\n<p>In local politics, Joan Hartmann secured the Third District Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors seat on Tuesday, beating rival Bruce Porter 13,563 to 11,511.</p>\n<p>When asked whether Hartmann’s election to the board of supervisors would make a difference in the community, Boris seemed to summarize many of the general election’s prevailing tensions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74136\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1780941814\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74125\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74136\" data-attachment-id=\"74136\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/local-women-gain-power-in-government/hbj-by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hbj-by-jenny-luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74136\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=350%2C525\" alt=\"Hannah-Beth Jackson speaks to a supporter at the Democrat watch party Tuesday.

Plaza on Saturday for a morning rally filled with music and environmental activism.</p>\n<p>The event began at 9:30 a.m. with a tribal dance by the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians. Stein was then introduced by Ben Manski, a Green Party member since 1990 who was Stein’s campaign manager for her 2012 presidential bid.</p>\n<p>Stein began by speaking about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would run through the land of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota. Contamination from the pipeline, she said, would be environmentally and culturally disastrous for the indigenous people.</p>\n<p>She added that a warrant is out for her arrest following her involvement in the protest at Standing Rock, prompting applause from a crowd of approximately 100 people.</p>\n<p>She focused mostly on environmental issues and the importance of voting for “the greater good, not the lesser of two evils,” and she frequently alluded to both the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates.</p>\n<p>Stein was well received by the moderately sized audience and several individuals frequently chanted Stein’s name and applauded for her speaking points.</p>\n<p>Commenting on Stein’s policy earlier this week in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>, Green Party Spokesman Mike Feinstein said it would be useless for Californians to vote Democratic in this election, given the state’s history of voting for Democratic leaders.</p>\n<p>“It’s a wasted vote if you’re a progressive and you’re voting for Hillary Clinton. You’re not gaining anything by doing that, on a policy basis,” Feinstein said.</p>\n<p>Per Hoel, a 32-year-old freelance videographer and local activist who attended the rally, was skeptical of her choice to focus primarily on the environment and other big ticket issues without delving fully into the issues with the two-party system.</p>\n<p>“I found the speech kind of underwhelming,” the rally attendee said. “I was expecting a reason to vote for her, not the things that I wanted to hear.”</p>\n<p>Mariah Clegg, a first-year sociology graduate student also in attendance at the rally, said she was undecided on whether to vote for the Green Party candidate and expressed that at the moment she did not know what was best for the movement.</p>\n<p>“It’s important that progressives don’t split along this line of people who are voting for the lesser of two evils and people who are doing the righteous thing,” Clegg said.</p>\n<p>Because Stein could not be on stage with Democrat and Republican presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Sunday,  she live-streamed answers for the presidential debate at <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/9/27/expanding_the_debate_jill_stein_debates\" target=\"_blank\"><i>democracynow.org.</i></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Community Center will be held at 5 p.m. Thursday at the I.V. Clinic building. The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, and Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p><strong>FOODBANK</strong><br>\nThe Santa Barbara County Foodbank hosts its monthly food distribution Thursday at Isla Vista Elementary School from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. The event is part of the Healthy School Pantry Program, which works to address food insecurity amongst children and families in the community. The Foodbank is simultaneously hosting a Community Resources Fair at the event for residents to learn where they can find food resources in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p><strong>FIRST FRIDAY</strong><br>\nI.V. First Fridays will return to the calendar at 8 p.m. Friday in Perfect Park. The event, which happens the first Friday of every month, will feature free food from C’est Cheese, China Pavilion at Chapala, Kyle’s Kitchen and Woodstock’s Pizza. The event will also feature live music from local acts Choice, Kaysin and The Real Savage Henry. The event is intended to provide a safe form of late-night entertainment in I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>COMPOSTING</strong><br>\nA representative from Healing Grounds Nursery will be leading a home gardening and composting workshop at 12 p.m. Saturday in front of the I.V. Food Co-op. Snacks will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>VEGAN</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Cafe). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>VOTERS</strong><br>\nCommunity volunteers are currently working to register 13,000 voters in Isla Vista and at UCSB. In years past, UCSB has been one of the top universities in terms of registering voters with as many as 11,000 voters. This year, volunteers hope to set a new record by registering thousands more for the November election. The last day to register is Oct. 24</p>\n<p><strong>STATE OF THE UNION</strong><br>\nThe next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday, Oct. 13 at the I.V. Clinic building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as they relate to the community. I.V. Community Network meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>IVRPD</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting at 6 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 13 in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Co-op. The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>DEBATE</strong><br>\nThe Nexus, KCSB and The Bottom Line will co-host a debate between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann, the candidates for Third District County Supervisor. The debate will be Thursday, Oct. 13 at I.V. Theater starting at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/","id":3907,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3906,3905,3904],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Divided by Party Politics in Supervisor Race","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pardallballots.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pardallballots.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":" Although it occupies a little over a square mile, Isla Vista is brimming with over 20,000 UC Santa Barbara students, retirement communities and clusters of longtime residents.

In the June 7 primary, Democrat Joan Hartmann took a lead of 42.8 percent over opponent Bruce Porter, who gained 35.5 percent.</p>\n<p>Bruce Porter, who is supported by the Republican Party, has registered voters at several campus spots and attended Pardall Carnival last weekend to garner support, but his registration tactics have drawn severe scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Porter hired Terry Baxter as his Isla Vista field director in July, one month after the primary election. Baxter was a former campaign assistant for Steve Pappas, who the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2008-05-27/for-3rd-district-supervisor-the-daily-nexus-strongly-endorses-steve-pappas/\" target=\"_blank\">endorsed </a>during his race for Third District Supervisor in 2008.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id=\"m_8610659200238821933gmail-docs-internal-guid-62726dd1-98b9-879a-f4c3-165575577e28\">“I don’t have a deathbed conversion here. I have a life of being connected to student communities.” </span></p>\n<p>— Joan Hartmann</p></blockquote>\n<p>After losing the race to Doreen Farr, Baxter and Pappas called to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-02-18/pappas-farr-face-off-at-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">reevaluate</a> over 9,000 votes from I.V. based on irregularities they found in voter records. The case was ultimately <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-03-30/pappas-case-thrown-out/\" target=\"_blank\">dismissed</a> due to lack of evidence, and Pappas was made to pay all court fees.</p>\n<p>Baxter’s background does not sit well with those observing Porter’s campaign in I.V., and several political operatives are equally unhappy with his current approach to registration.</p>\n<p>“We want to make sure that everybody we register knows they have a choice, that they can register at home or register here,” he told the Nexus, responding to allegations his campaign has attempted to stifle the student vote by reducing its concentration in the Third District.</p>\n<p>He stands by his decision to appoint Baxter to his staff, and said, “Terry Baxter is not going around telling people not to register to vote.”</p>\n<p>“That would be absolutely silly and un-American,” he said. “If she did, I would fire her on the spot. That would be absolutely wrong.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann, whose campaign has been vocal about their mistrust of Porter, said her connection to students began long ago and is rooted in community involvement.</p>\n<p><span id=\"m_8610659200238821933gmail-docs-internal-guid-62726dd1-98b9-879a-f4c3-165575577e28\">“I don’t have a deathbed conversion here,” she said. “I have a life of being connected to student communities.”</span></p>\n<p>The parties continue to battle for voters, and efforts from organizers involved with the UCSB Voter Registration Volunteer Coalition have reached over 5,000 registrations.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, leader of the Yes on E&amp;F campaign and supporter of Joan Hartmann, said the group aims to reach 13,000 votes in the next 18 days before the last day to register for the general election.</p>\n<p>“Individuals are transient, but our demographics are not,” Abboud said, adding that the I.V. vote will continue to be relevant long after the current class of students is gone.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We want to make sure that everybody we register knows they have a choice, that they can register at home or register here.”</p>\n<p>— Bruce Porter</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jay Freeman, who came in third to Porter and lost the primary in the Third District Race, has thrown his hat in the ring to register voters as well, but he said his team aimed for the “high hanging fruit” in months before and after the June election.</p>\n<p>He has supported Hartmann, and several of his supporters say they will vote for her in the November general election, but he is unhappy with both candidates running for the supervisor position. Freeman is not a registered Democrat and said the race for the Third District has reaffirmed his decision against doing so.</p>\n<p>Freeman added that the idea of political representation in I.V. is very subjective, and though voter registration is essential, the I.V. vote also suppresses the vote of agriculture land in the rest of the Third District and the Santa Ynez Valley. A balanced election would require full voter participation from all areas.</p>\n<p>Political tension runs high in the months before the primary, and Freeman, as well as Andrew Gabriel Pragin, a supporter and former UCSB student, expressed concern that Democratic voter registration tactics were dissuading others from being engaged in the election.</p>\n<p>Abboud denied that the party encourages voters to side with Democrats, and said “we do nonpartisan voter registration when we need to. We do it because we care about voters.”</p>\n<p>Students and candidates campaigning for the crucial I.V. vote have found themselves at the center of a crossfire between party lines, and the intensity of the environment continues to increase.</p>\n<p>Democrats hoped to espouse the idea that “Isla Vista is united,” Pragin said, but the campaign continues to forge a split between political activists in the crucial election.</p>\n<p>“It provides a front of openness, transparency,” he said. “In reality, they’re doing quite a lot of work to make it seem that way.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

shootings and other gun-related deaths.</p>\n<p>Sunday night’s Concert Across America to End Gun Violence in Arlington Theatre touched upon recent memories of tragedy in Santa Barbara. It pushed for gun reform in light of local deaths due to gun violence, including <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-03-25/suspect-arrested-in-diabolical-triple-homicide/\" target=\"_blank\">the murder of the Han family on March 25</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/sheriff-releases-report-detailing-events-of-2014-i-v-mass-murder/\" target=\"_blank\">the mass shooting of six students on May 23, 2014 in Isla Vista</a>.</p>\n<p>The concert featured several artists from the southern California area, locally based and world famous. Individuals closely affected by the numerous acts of gun violence in recent years spoke to the crowd of over 2,000 people.</p>\n<p>“Like you, I’m here to enjoy some great music and celebrate the lives of those who were stolen from us,” said Bob Weiss in his opening remarks Sunday night. Weiss’s daughter, Veronika Weiss, was one of the six victims of the Isla Vista shooting.</p>\n<p>Weiss urged those in attendance to become “opinion leaders” in the Santa Barbara community, to push for gun law reform in order to “form a more perfect union.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72611\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2116263089\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72607\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72611\" data-attachment-id=\"72611\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-8-06-08-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?fit=1390%2C745&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1390,745\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-8-06-08-pm\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?fit=888%2C476&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72611\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?resize=450%2C241\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-8-06-08-pm\" width=\"450\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?w=1390&amp;ssl=1 1390w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?resize=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?resize=768%2C412&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?resize=1024%2C549&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72611\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bob Weiss, father of Veronika Weiss, urges the 2,000 audience members to become “opinion leaders” in the Santa Barbara community. <em>Courtesy of Concert Across America</em></p></div>\n<p>“It’s a matter of life and death,” he said. “Let me tell you from experience: nowhere in this country is safe from gun violence. We know that all too well here in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Weiss then introduced on stage local musician Daniela Spagnola, a next-door neighbor to the Weiss family who dedicated her song “Peace Will Light the Way” to the memory of Veronika Weiss.</p>\n<p>Dr. Jason Prystowsky, the emergency physician who worked in Cottage Hospital in Goleta on the night of May 23, 2014, shared his experiences working in cities around the country where emergency rooms see several gunshot victims in a given night, which he said tends to make physicians “hardened” to gun violence.</p>\n<p>“The night of May 23, 2014, was a little different; this hit very close to home.” he said. “That which always happens somewhere else happened here, and that shook us up a bit.”</p>\n<p>Prystowsky posed a few questions to the audience: “Why is it so much easier to acquire a gun than it is to acquire a psychiatrist?” and “Would a well-armed Isla Vista have made the body count higher or lower?” (Several in the audience yelled “higher” following the latter question).</p>\n<p>On video, celebrities like film actor Jeff Bridges and singer-songwriter Jack Johnson, both of whom are Santa Barbara-area residents, asked listeners to vote for candidates who are “passionate about ending gun violence,” as Johnson put it.</p>\n<p>Students from local singing schools DMK Studio and the Santa Barbara School of Performing Arts performed a song called “A Song of Peace” in memory of Emily Han, the 5-year-old daughter killed in March along with her mother and father. Han was a student at DMK Studio.</p>\n<p>Taking the stage also were musical performances from UC Santa Barbara’s Naked Voices, who performed the Leonard Cohen song “Hallelujah,” and Lois Mahalia with the One Voice Choir.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles-based Latin group Ozomatli played a longer set just before the concert’s 20-minute intermission. During this time, event organizers hosted a silent auction to fundraise the Santa Barbara Gun Buyback Program.</p>\n<p>The latter part of the evening featured Venice, another L.A.-based rock band comprised of two brothers and their two cousins. Frontman Kipp Lennon shared how their family has also lost someone to gun violence — his father — and how they have “survived and grown closer” and have “tried to make music out of that.”</p>\n<p>Concluding the evening were headliners Kenny Loggins, who brought on local talents like Santa Barbara High School senior Jackson Gillies, and Michael McDonald.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/","id":3904,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3903,3902,3901],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":9,"route":"/categories/news/county","highestPage":11}},"__N_SSG":true}
