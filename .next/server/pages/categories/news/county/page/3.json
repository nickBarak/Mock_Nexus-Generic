UTS specializes in “utility line clearance work” and provides services such as vegetation management and storm and emergency response, </span><a href=\"http://www.utilitytreeservice.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to the company’s website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to the court complaint, UTS inspected a faulty tree but allegedly made no effort to clear the hazard. The tree later collapsed on power and communication lines, belonging to SoCal Edison and Frontier Communications respectively, and ignited adjacent vegetation, the court complaint alleged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The complaint also claims that Frontier Communications improperly maintained vegetation adjacent to its communication lines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brush fire soon manifested into a forest fire, engulfing an area with a length equal to the distance from </span><a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedImages/countyofsb/Content/Emergencies/reyMap08-30-16.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2138648331\" data-slb-group=\"89672\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista to Montecito.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among others, alleged damages to the land include “the mitigation, rehabilitation, and reforestation of burned areas; loss of and damage to timber, habitat, wildlife, watershed and earth protection… environmental damage… soil damage and erosion,” according to the court complaint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the SUP signed by SoCal Edison, the electrical company is mandated to compensate the National Forest Service for any damages incurred on the land, the court complaint alleged. After almost a month, the fire was extinguished but resulted in “suppression costs and rehabilitation costs in excess of $26 million,” the court complaint read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Aug. 17, the day the court complaint was filed, SoCal Edison allegedly had not paid “any part of the sum demanded by the United States” — an amount which was not disclosed in the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SoCal Edison, Frontier Communications and UTS did not respond to requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November 2018, SoCal Edison </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-02/southern-california-edison-admits-to-being-a-source-of-the-thomas-fire/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">admitted to being one of the sources of the Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which swept through Ventura and Santa Barbara County between December 2017 and January 2018 and ultimately burned over 281,893 acres of land.

CSD pictured at the first meeting. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that first meeting, I really remember the feeling of the weight of 50 years of activism on our shoulders,” Bertrand said. “People had fought for this for so long, and there had been so many efforts and so much love for this community that went into this long-term movement to create a local government.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inaugural board was composed of seven members: Bertrand, Vice President Natalie Jordan, Secretary Brandt and Directors Jay Freeman, Robert Geis, Father Jon Hedges and George Thurlow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the board’s seven members, five are elected. The other two seats are appointed by UCSB and Santa Barbara County to represent their respective interests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the district first formed, Bertrand was a student at Santa Barbara City College, while Brandt ‘19 and Jordan ‘18 were students at UCSB. Two long-term I.V. residents, entrepreneur Jay Freeman ‘03 and local reverend Father Jon Hedges, also won elected seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geis, a retired county official, and Thurlow ‘73, a university administrator, hold the appointed positions. Both are long-term Santa Barbara residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand and Brandt both said the different generations represented on the board, specifically the “diversity of viewpoints,” formed a more cohesive board, with Brandt pointing specifically to Geis’ years of previous experience in local government as an advantage the board would not have had otherwise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the big disadvantages of being young in local government spaces, which are predominantly older and whiter and more traditional, is that you don’t really have the context for a lot of things and why certain things are set up the way that they are and how to best go about things to achieve the outcome that you want,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Abboud ‘14, former Associated Students President and SBCC Board Trustee, took over as the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-11/community-services-district-hires-jonathan-abboud-as-interim-general-manager/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">district’s interim general manager</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2017 and as the permanent general manager in December 2018. The position of interim general manager was created to account for the district’s unexpectedly small budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-13/i-v-csd-shakes-up-board-leadership/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succeeded Bertrand as president in December</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; Jordan </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/term-in-review-i-v-csd-vice-president-natalie-jordan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has since left</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was replaced by new director Kristie Nguyen; Geis is now vice president, and the secretary position was eliminated. </span></p>\n<p><b>FUNDING: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district faced several crippling impediments at its formation, but none more so than one that loomed for nearly two years after its creation: a lack of funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board theoretically had the power to implement programs and make changes around I.V., it didn’t have the funding to do so. An eight percent utility tax on I.V. residents </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed in the 2016 election, with only 62% of residents voting yes.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It needed 66.66% of the vote to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Darcél Elliott had managed the campaigns for both the district and its accompanying tax. When the district passed but the funding failed, Elliott pointed to campaigns by I.V. property owners who had vocally opposed the tax.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In this election, fear won over hope,” Elliott said on election night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district’s funds would come from a yearly $200,000 grant from UCSB, but the money could only be spent on services the university agreed were useful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if the district failed to secure a tax by 2023, it would cease to exist, a deadline that haunted the newly formed district. So when the board placed a new tax on the June 2018 ballot, local campaigners ramped up their efforts to win voter approval. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-83520\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of the “Vote Yes on Measure R” campaign celebrate after learning of the passing of the tax. (Pictured left to right: Ethan Bertrand, Emily Murray, Spencer Brandt and Jonathan Abboud.) <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 80% of Isla Vistans would vote to provide the district funding through </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure R</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a measure that was nearly identical to its failed predecessor, Measure F. Measure R promised improvements to parking, public safety, lighting and sidewalks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75% vs. 17.25%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eight percent tax has brought an influx of cash into the district. The district ended its 2018-2019 fiscal year with nearly half a million in spending compared to over $800,000 in income – a far cry from what it started out with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the next fiscal year, the district </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-19/i-v-csd-budget-sees-about-200000-increase-in-funding-for-next-fiscal-year/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expects a $200,000 increase in funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rounding up to more than $1 million, according to numbers released by the district in May. </span></p>\n<p><b>THE CSD’S FIRST SERVICES: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without consistent revenue, the district spent its first year setting up as many services as possible with its limited resources, which involved “lots of strong partnerships with other government agencies and non-profit service providers,” Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board’s first project was expanding community policing efforts. Community Service Organization (CSO) safety officers have always escorted students home on weekend nights, but the district worked with UCSB to set up in-person stations at streetside locations for students to seek help.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSOs — who almost always are UCSB students themselves — worked over 3,000 hours and provided over 300 escorts during the last academic year, according to numbers released in July. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re there not to enforce, but to help people, to give out water, to help people charge their phones, to give people an escort home and when there is a safety concern, they’re there to call it into the police,” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD has also focused on sexual violence-related issues, hiring the first </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpersonal violence investigator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to work within the UCPD and partnering with Standing Together Against Sexual Assault (STESA) to set up a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the district’s most recent initiatives is a community-led beautification program, where I.V. residents can report graffiti, trash, vandalism or lighting issues to the district. The district will then either send out workers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">houseless community members they hired to tackle these issues </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or forward the requests to the county if necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community,” Brandt said at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">program’s launch</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April.</span></p>\n<p><b>WHERE THE CSD HAS STRUGGLED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The directors have acknowledged that the board, in its first iteration, struggled to reflect the demographics of I.V.’s population – six of the seven board members are male, and Bertrand was the only person of color on the board until Nguyen replaced Jordan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen is still the only woman on the board, and Bertrand is the only member that identifies as LGBTQ+. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I say this as a straight white guy – it’s a huge problem that it’s only people who look like me who feel most empowered to get involved in local government,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We benefit so much from the perspective and the leadership of women and people of color, and it is really something that we, speaking for myself and for all of us, really try to encourage the next generation of leaders to reflect that and would like to see a more diverse board in the future.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand emphasized that the board did vote a “gay man of color” as its first president and a woman as its vice president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district has also stalled on its promise of a low-income exception to the tax, which it campaigned on ahead of the June 2018 election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last fall, more than four months after the tax had passed, the directors were still split on whether or not to implement the exemption, with some directors arguing that residents could expose loopholes to avoid the tax. The board has still not addressed implementing the promised exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9, 2018 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, the district has also failed to substantively address the issue of parking in I.V. — an issue it was formed to tackle. Parking in I.V. remains one of the biggest downsides to living in the tightly-packed neighborhood, with limited parking attached to houses and even fewer open spots available on the street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street parking in I.V. can also be dangerous; numerous students have posted on social media about windows being smashed and mirrors removed by drunk cyclists or a baseball bat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During larger events like Deltopia or Halloween, the university actively encourages students to purchase parking passes to move their cars out of I.V. and remove valuables from their cars. </span></p>\n<p><b>“</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the broader parking issue, I think that’s been one of those issues where everyone has made it very clear to us that it’s a difficult problem to solve, and that if we’re gonna do anything on it, we need to have the internal staff capacity to be able to put something together that actually works,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the future, we really need to have a professional come in and assess the situation and make some strong recommendations.” </span></p>\n<p><b>WHAT COMES NEXT?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD is tackling what is probably its biggest project yet – the revival of the Isla Vista Community Center (IVCC), a center that many I.V. residents thought would never exist. The center is set to have a soft opening in October and a grand opening in January or February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand noted that even before the I.V.

Tragedy) was chosen for the director role because of her history of activism. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years ago, Collins Puente joined this seaside community as UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) community advisor. She was recruited for the position following the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/five-years-later-i-v-honors-victims-of-2014-shooting-with-recreation-of-original-vigil/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2014 Isla Vista tragedy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because, as she put it, the community wanted to see tangible changes in the culture, social services and space in I.V.: “There was a strong need for healing from the tragedy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente credited her time at A.S. for preparing her for the role of the I.V. Community Center (IVCC) director. While working for A.S., she focused on community-based initiatives, tackling several projects and focusing on “solving everyday problems that the residents of Isla Vista faced, like tenant issues, eviction, mental health, alcohol and drugs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente, who was exposed to activism growing up as a child in Guatemala during its Civil War, was selected for her role based on her history as an activist, she said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the path toward creating the center, let alone hiring a director, was not linear; the building housing the first community center in I.V. was sold in the 1970s, and financial setbacks prevented the community from building another. It wasn’t until 2012, after the county </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?fbclid=IwAR3QaUeBMMhQK_y2x2568or0Cmjdyrxma-7hGTLh3PsmHbDRalDbqA86r1E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purchased the center’s current location</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 976 Embarcadero del Mar, that steps towards actively creating a new center began.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center will have a soft opening in October with a grand opening in either January or February 2020, according to an update posted to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Facebook page. Collins Puente officially began her position on Aug. 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Collins Puente, the IVCC will act as a hub for I.V. residents, addressing the various needs of the community. Puente will work with the IVCC Advisory Board, which is currently being filled, to “ensure that the values and priorities of community members are thoughtfully taken into account in order to inform the strategic direction, vision, and programming of the new Community Center,” according to a press release sent out by the I.V. CSD board of directors in mid-July.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advisory board will be composed of several members of the community, some of whom have already been elected by the I.V. CSD. At the Aug. 13 I.V. CSD meeting, the board voted to postpone its vote on the final non-profit seat on the board until its Aug. 27 meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new IVCC director position is funded by a $177,000 one-year grant from the I.V. CSD to Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) in order to manage the development, fundraising, programming and strategic future of the center, the press release said. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I intend for the community to feel a sense of co-ownership over the space so that it can contribute to being a model of collaboration.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said that Collin Puente’s experience with social justice through nonprofit work will help create a “collective vision” for the center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been lucky to know and work with people in Isla Vista who are incredibly dedicated to building community – none more so than Diana Collins-Puente. As the Director of Community Affairs in Associated Students, she advised me and countless other students who sought to make a difference,” Brandt said in an email statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vistans have been fighting for a community center for over three decades, and I can’t think of a better person to implement our collective vision than Diana.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente has big plans for the future of the community center, hoping to balance the needs of the UCSB student population living in I.V. with the rest of the community. She hopes to craft the IVCC into a multi-use space, which would include hosting exercise and nutrition classes as well as a wide range of recreational and self-help activities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has a need for classrooms, so the space could potentially be used for that, while also providing a practical space for the rest of the community. Classes would be offered to them as well, ranging from legal classes to self-help classes, and we plan to include a demonstration kitchen,” Collins Puente said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente noted that plans for the IVCC are rooted in her involvement with the Pardall Center – a UCSB-operated collaborative space located in I.V. – for the last five years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want the IVCC to do what the Pardall Center couldn’t,” Collins Puente said. “The needs of the community have simply been too large for the Pardall Center, so the IVCC will address the larger projects that can’t be sustained at the Pardall Center.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente also plans to work with the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District, which will manage the recreational activities and play a role in the development of the space, alongside the IVYP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I intend for the community to feel a sense of co-ownership over the space so that it can contribute to being a model of collaboration,” Collins Puente said. “The center really speaks to the very unique nature of how I.V. has been able to support the building of institutions like the IVYP, the IVCC, and the I.V. CSD… It is a hub that brings together diverse members of the community that allows for us to engage with each other.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a pride in it being a community effort.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

I decided [during] my freshman year to get involved and see if I can help out as much as I can,” Griffin said in a statement to the board prior to his appointment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin said he first saw the open seat while </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-22/recap-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs-candidate-forum/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">running for Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/campus-united-reclaims-executive-branch-stronghold-maintains-senate-majority/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter 2019 elections</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At the time, he realized that he didn’t want to get elected as both EVPLA and IVRPD director and not have sufficient time for both positions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After losing [the EVPLA] election, I decided that this was another way I could give back, and the board position was still open. I was lucky enough to get it, and I’m happy to be on it,” Griffin said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the newest member of the board, one of Griffin’s first goals is to renovate two of the parks in I.V.: Walter Capps Park and Pardall Gardens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin said Walter Capps Park, a large tract of dirt and grass located oceanside at the beginning of the 67 block of Del Playa Drive, has recently been discussed as a site for renovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been in the talks recently to put together a plan to build a park there and to have different facilities like work-out stations and shade structures. So I’d like to be a part of the design of that which will be happening hopefully within the next year,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also wants to renovate Pardall Gardens, which neighbors Lao Wang on Pardall Road and currently houses a few benches and sparse shrubbery. Griffin wants to “transition the park to become a space utilized by students and community members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is also looking forward to the implementation of the first solar table at the southeast corner of People’s Park. The solar table will house outlets charged by solar panels and was a project initially started in the EVPLA office under Jeike Meijer, who served as EVPLA for the 2018-19 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The foundation has been laid, and the table will hopefully be installed and ready by Fall Quarter 2019, according to Griffin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To familiarize himself with the IVRPD’s revenue, Griffin said he intends to join the Finance Committee. Soutar and Bernard are the current directors on the committee; Bernard replaced Washington following her resignation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I want] to figure out exactly where the tax revenues come from and how to maintain the balance budget that we’ve had recently for the next few years going forward,” Griffin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to be able to learn how to manage and still provide very good resources for our community but still maintain that healthy side of the financials.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside working on financials within the IVRPD, Griffin also wants to collaborate with the EVPLA office and the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) on future projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He hopes to spread awareness about I.V.’s history by creating a timeline of I.V.’s history in the new community center — which is set to have a soft opening in August — in order to create a stronger connection between the long-term residents and students.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [July 31, 12:30 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Matthew Griffin had said “stage structures” instead of “shade structures” in regards to Walter Capps Park.

id=\"caption-attachment-88036\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grange (pictured above at the opening of the Edible Garden Project) will be serving on the board until November 2020. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange, an environmental studies major, will be joining Carlos Lopez, Pegeen Soutar and Sarah Bernard on the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) Board of Directors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange’s term will span from May 2019 to November 2020, filling in for the remainder of former Director Lebell’s term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He filled one of two open seats on the board; the second spot is up for grabs following Director Celine Washington’s decision to leave the board, announced by Lopez during the same meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the meeting, Bernard said she has confidence in Grange’s capability, especially with the projects he can bring to the board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I see a lot of potential with Whit, with a lot of projects that include the community garden, including all different types of groups from the community,” Bernard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange first learned about the opening through his work developing the </span><a href=\"http://www.islavistamethodist.com/edible-garden-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community garden</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the University United Methodist Church on the corner of Camino del Sur and Sueño Road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange said his previous work in I.V. has familiarized himself with the area and invested in him a significance for I.V. parks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of college students don’t really see I.V. as much of a community at all, but the parks are a space where people can come together and neighbors can meet each other,” Grange said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a new director, Grange said he wants to focus on local community-based projects. Grange said community gardens, local government and being a part of the community are what he enjoys.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange hopes to learn more about the process of achieving projects in the community and “seeing how that project culminates and how funding is pulled together and how staff works with board members, works with the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone has an idea for a project in their community or if someone has some sort of vision they want to accomplish, the process for something like that, start to finish, is really cool,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just how all these different things come together because there’s so many parts in play, it’s almost mind boggling.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange plans to work on several projects, including the expansion of Estero Gardens and the development of the new community center set to open in August.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Grange hopes to see more students come out and interact with some of the more permanent residents in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most students view I.V. as a transitory place.

Original estimations of tax revenue were $777,000, but according to estimated actuals — what was actually raised this fiscal year — the district will only receive $691,003 this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax, also known as Measure R, was affirmed by voters <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/#search\">June 2018</a>, and a delay in its implementation led to fewer total funds than original estimations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the greater amount of funding for the 2019-2020 year, I.V. CSD also plans to increase spending dramatically compared to the current fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, the I.V. CSD proposed spending $830,000 and is actually projected to spend $481,813.70 by the end of the fiscal year on June 30. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Projected spending for the 2019-2020 fiscal year totals $1,105,900.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funds will primarily be split between operations and community programs, with additional funding going toward safety, public works/graffiti abatement, housing and parking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district held a public forum on April 16 for community members to speak about the budget, which Board Member Ethan Bertrand said played into the decision-making process about money allocation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d like to thank the many community members who participated in the budget process for providing valuable feedback about how we can best serve the community,” Bertrand said in a message to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year’s budget continues to invest in public safety services, youth and family services, beautification and infrastructure improvements, rental housing mediation, and more,” Bertrand said in the message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This budget provides funding for the operation of the Isla Vista Community Center, which is expected to open in the next 6 months. The budget also fully funds the District’s sexual assault/interpersonal violence investigation and prevention program, the Isla Vista Safety Station program, graffiti abatement [and] services for community members experiencing homelessness.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More will be spent on salaries and employee benefits this year as well. $215,800 is allocated for employees, compared to $186,800 this past fiscal year. Only $67,384.95 of that money was actually spent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the community programs budget is in professional and special services and contractual services, which both allotted for similar funds compared to the current fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the 2018-2019 fiscal year for I.V. CSD comes to a close in June, there remains $416,523.10 left unspent from the year alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to General Manager Jonathan Abboud, all unspent funds from the year will go toward building <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o2-miRWadkTvXLYas6VZ5IghMSqO8nq7/view?fbclid=IwAR0msSTA6a6RbepW6ZuYus8M8Nm0BzaheHrIirxhhns0F20ppRJUUH2uzC4\">CSD reserves</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This includes short- and long-term cash reserves for regular operations, a capital maintenance fund to support community center equipment and repairs, a self-insurance fund and a capital outlay fund for future large scale public infrastructure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, I.V.

For Santa Barbara City College and non-student low-income residents, Sir said VendTek will provide specially-made cards with barcodes so they can access the vending machine as well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, Sir planned to have the vending machine stationed on campus, but, after working with UC Santa Barbara administration, she was informed that it would conflict with the school’s “vending machine contracts,” forcing her to take the project off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), expressed interest in the vending machine because “it doesn’t necessarily have to be run in the traditional way that a food pantry is.” However, Sir said the new vending machine will acquire food in a similar manner by obtaining “pre-made, unsold food items.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jacob Bider, a third-year environmental studies major, worked with Sir to help find potential sources for food donations. Bider originally canvassed local restaurants such as Bagel Cafe, Buddha Bowls, Cajé, Woodstocks and Pizza My Heart to gauge their interest in donating to a food pantry. He assumed they would also express interest in donating to a vending machine with similar goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also reached out to the local Trader Joe’s and Amazon outlets, both of which expressed interest in making food donations in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir noted that “about 48% of UCSB undergraduate students surveyed and 31% of graduate students surveyed do not have a consistent source of high-quality, nutritious food.” When food pantries are closed, usually around 7 p.m. at the latest, there is nowhere else to obtain a free meal either on campus or in I.V., according to Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir believes the vending machine will also benefit students struggling with housing security, as some students do not have access to a dedicated kitchen to cook meals.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure proper health regulations when serving the repackaged food, Sir reached out to Kendra Wise, an environmental health specialist from the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we are not profiting from this vending machine, we can register as a non-profit organization that’s distributing food.  [Wise] recommends that people who are going to help us get their training online to be able to handle this food and repackage it,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of our budget includes all the regulations of what we need to handle this food, and I will be working with Kendra Wise to make sure that this food will fit the Santa Barbara County health regulations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir placed heavy emphasis on the proposed vending machine’s location, because, unlike on-campus options such as the A.S. Food Bank, the vending machine will be open to non-student residents in I.V. — the only one of its kind.  </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [May 20, 10:56 a.m.]: A previous version of this article wrongly stated the vending machine would be purchased through the company VendTech, but has been corrected to the right company, VendTek. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD’s elections year was approved on April 9. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mailers were recently distributed to I.V. residences to notify voters of the change, announcing that the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) would now hold its elections during the statewide general election beginning on Nov. 3, 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combining the district’s election with the general election is a change that would save the district approximately $83,000 this year alone, CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said at the district’s Jan. 8 meeting, during which the district voted to petition for the election year change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positions on the board were previously up for election during odd-numbered years because the I.V. CSD </span><a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=10505.&amp;lawCode=ELEC\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially formed in March of 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even though it was voted into existence in the 2016 general election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the CSD was created by the voters, it was with the intent to elect Board Members during even year elections,” Board President Spencer Brandt said in a message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said that in 2018, the county elections office informed the I.V. CSD that the district could not conduct an election for board members in the 2018 midterm general elections, “citing a quirk in State election law.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Elections Code 10505 </span><a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=10505.&amp;lawCode=ELEC\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mandates </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that “if the district is formed in an odd-numbered year, the officers elected at the formation election shall hold office until noon on the first Friday in December of the next following odd-numbered year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renee Bischof, chief deputy registrar of voters for Santa Barbara County, reached out in early January to Abboud to inform him that </span><a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-10404.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Code 10404</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would allow the I.V. CSD to petition the Board of Supervisors for the change, Abboud said at the Jan. 8 CSD meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bischof also told Abboud that all other special districts in the county had already moved their elections to even-numbered years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $83,000 the district will save amounts to almost 10% of the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/i-v-csd-tax-nets-half-a-million-less-than-estimated/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V.

CSD to hold its own election in an odd-numbered year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district would still spend some money in the 2020 election but would not spend nearly as much as they would holding their own election. Abboud cited the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June 2018 Measure R election</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in which the district paid $11,000, as an example of cost-saving during an even-numbered year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The research is conclusive that even-year elections allow public agencies to spend fewer tax dollars conducting elections, and foster more democratic participation,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said the county calculated the savings estimate by tallying the number of registered voters in I.V. and applying a cost of approximately $1.50 to each one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three positions on the board of directors will now be up for grabs in the 2020 general election, as opposed to fall 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those positions are currently held by Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Director Ethan Bertrand and Director Kristie Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen’s and Hedges’s seats will also be extended from two-year terms to four-year terms in the 2020 election, per Government Code section </span><a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-61250.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61250(e)(1)(A)(i)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seat currently held by Bertrand will continue to be a two-year term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt and Director Jay Freeman, who originally ran for four-year terms, will have their terms extended from Dec. 2021 to Dec. 2022. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-87716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The program was announced at the April 23 meeting of the I.V. CSD. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A designated sober party monitor is alerted through telephone if SBSO receives a noise complaint about the party. The monitor then has 20 minutes to shut down the party and lower noise levels, according to a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/sheriffs-office-announces-iv-party-registration-program/\">press release</a> sent out by SBSO on Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is intended to foster a partnership between residents and police, allowing party hosts to remedy noise complaints without the need for a police response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy Justin Schroeder, community resource deputy for Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), announced the launch of the program at the April 23 meeting of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If a complaint is received, we then call or text that person and they have 20 minutes to mitigate that noise problem themselves without a police response. So our slogan for that is, ‘Get a text, not a ticket,’” said Schroeder at the I.V. CSD meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So we’re hoping people utilize that program, just to kind of foster a more community-oriented policing method out here in Isla Vista, and we hope it’s a popular program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Party Registration Program has been in Schroeder’s plans since his <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\">instatement</a> as Community Resource Deputy back in November 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think the students realize there’s like families and young kids that live in Isla Vista. We have some families that call every single night about a noise complaint,” Schroeder said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program builds on Schroeder’s goals of constructing a community-policing model and bridging the gap between law enforcement and community members. The program allows I.V. residents to monitor themselves, without the need for police intervention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar programs are also in effect in cities around the country. San Luis Obispo’s adoption of this program has been successful at California Polytechnic State University, according to the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must follow a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IV-party-registration-guidlines2.pdf\">set of guidelines</a> in order to register a party with the program. Parties must be registered at least 48 hours in advance and can only be registered for Fridays and Saturdays, as well as Sunday if the following Monday is a holiday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police will be dispatched if contact cannot be made with the party monitor, and a citation will be issued if noise violations are verified. A citation will also be issued if a second complaint is received by SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Properties will also lose registration privileges for nine months if complaints are received for two separate parties within nine months of each other. Individuals who have received a noise violation citation or a social host ordinance violation cannot register for the program for nine months after the last violation occurred. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, people who have received a public nuisance party citation cannot register with the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Juan Camarena of the IVFP also believes that the program will create a clearer line of communication between I.V. residents and law enforcement, along with establishing a safe environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program embraces the idea of community-oriented policing and partners community members with law enforcement to solve the problem of noise complaints in Isla Vista,” Camarena said in the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It also creates an open line of communication between the community and law enforcement, shows transparency and cooperation, and encourages future partnerships to solve other crimes.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

According to Fischer, students and long-term residents complained about the bench’s constant occupation, noting that it deteriorated the curb appeal of the intersection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the bench was removed and broken into “a whole bunch of pieces,” according to Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould. Following the removal of the bench, Gould said the Public Works Department approached the IVRPD, asking if they would like to keep the pieces.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had an offer to receive all these slabs of stone and big boulders and we said, ‘Yes, please, we’ll take them,’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD had the Public Works Department deliver the pieces to the Sueno Bark Park, where they plan to permanently keep the benches after they are rebuilt, according to Gould. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD plans to “reconstruct [the bench] into two, probably three separate smaller benches,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is currently no plan to have an unveiling for the new benches, Gould said the IVRPD plans to have them finished before May 18, the day of their planned “Bark Party” at the Sueno Bark Park. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On May 18, we’re having an event in the dog park called ‘Bark Party.’ We’ve got ‘Care For Paws’ out there doing free or discounted immunizations for dogs and Pet Smart’s giving away coupons and stuff.

Bluffs Report released in March 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposed changes to the I.V. Bluff Policy follow an instance in which <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/\">15 feet of the cliff between 6653 and 6663 Del Playa Drive collapsed</a> in a short period in January 2017, according to the report. This collapse forced out 28 residents from the surrounding properties after a portion of the balcony crumbled off the cliff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This “single-event failure” — an event where the most cliff erosion occurs in a single point in time, as opposed to erosion over time — exceeded the current requirement of five feet and “raised concern regarding the current policy for structure setbacks, which includes an assumption that a single bluff failure will be no more than five feet,” according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, not all properties would be affected by the new proposal, Abolhoda noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to site-specific conditions of property, the threshold distance can be different for each property, depending on the type of foundation of the building, how close the building is to the property line and how close the south side of the building is to the cliff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Property owners would be able to submit geotechnical evaluation reports to sidestep having to make renovations or cutbacks to the building, so long as the building meets the division’s requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we know that site-to-site situations can vary, we are asking that property owners hire a geotechnical engineer to evaluate their specific condition and let us know,” Abolhoda said. “[They can then] offer us a geotechnical report if they believe the 15 feet that would be the basis of our new policy is not really applicable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once we get that report, we get other geotechnical engineers to review it and see if it’s acceptable, and if it’s acceptable then the policy would be based on a single event that is going to happen in that specific site. That’s how our policies are being revised.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buildings with shallow foundations, about 24 to 32 inches deep, would be less likely to meet the division’s building safety requirements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buildings with caisson foundations in good shape have a better chance of sliding by the new policy, but a “series of triggers” would be established to monitor the integrity of the foundation and the safety of the building over time. The triggers would designate points in erosion which would render the support structures ineffective and require property owners to address the conditions of the building at that time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a building is less than 15 feet from the bluff, the property would be placed on a watch list to be “monitored on a continuing basis for bluff retreat and building proximity,” according to the report. The property owners would also be notified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can adjust our policy according to what is considered the most prevalent single-event failure that can be experienced on that site,” Abolhoda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a building comes within 10 feet of the bluff, the property owner will be issued an official “Notice of Violation” and will be required to address the “noncompliant conditions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If nothing is done to address the threshold violation, the property owner would be fined and receive a “Notice of Non-Compliance,” according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the event that a building  comes within five feet of the bluff, the property owner may be issued a “Notice and Order to Vacate Building and Abate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it is determined that the property does not meet the safety threshold, the property owner has several options.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The owner can “cut the building back a minimum of 30 feet,” but would also be allowed to do smaller cutbacks on a “case-by-case basis.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They could also maintain the building in its current condition if a geotechnical engineering report proves the building is safe to live in.

Safe Committee, aiming to both recognize April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month and set a new tone for survivorship in I.V., according to Spencer Brandt, president of the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</p>\n<p>“[Sexual violence] is something that our community knows and takes very seriously already, but it was also important to try to debunk some of the myths that are around sexual violence both when it comes to law enforcement, when it comes to who can be made into a victim or survivor of sexual violence,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The video series tackles attitudes toward sexual assault with a three-pronged approach, focusing on the role and support of law enforcement, prosecutors, friends and family during survivors’ times of turmoil. Each video includes members from the aforementioned communities discussing support for survivors in the legal and healing processes.</p>\n<p>I.V. Safe Committee is a collaborative group composed of legal and government offices in I.V. and Santa Barbara. The committee is made up of the I.V. CSD, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office, UCPD, SBSO, Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) and more.</p>\n<p>The committee and Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), a UCSB student group advocating for survivor resources and ending sexual violence, worked on the videos together over the last months.</p>\n<p>The videos were released just in time for April, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>One of Brandt’s hopes was that the videos would do more to encourage survivors to come forward with their experiences. He said this is an important goal in addressing and solving sexual violence in the community.</p>\n<p>“If we do not have more people feel comfortable going through and doing that, then it’s going to continue to be very difficult to solve a lot of these cases, and that really is the bottom line,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Numbers from UCSB’s Title IX Office showed that there had been 320 individual reports of sexual violence in 2018, 140 instances of sexual harassment, 18 instances of sexual discrimination and 133 instances labeled “other.”</p>\n<p>But Brandt noted the numbers of survivors who report incidents of sexual violence is far less than the number of people who actually experience it.</p>\n<p>“The harsh reality is that sexual violence is both incredibly prevalent in the community and peer-reviewed scientific studies have shown that the likelihood of survivors coming forward and reporting their assault to either a law enforcement agency or through other avenues is incredibly low,” Brandt said. “We’re looking at a number of about 10 or 20%.”</p>\n<p>For Emily Montalvo-Telford, director of SASA, it was important that the working process of the videos included input from student voices, especially considering the intended audience of the videos.</p>\n<p>“It’s always best to work with the community that you’re trying to send a message to and hearing [student] voices as a part of the conversation,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The conversation around sexual violence necessitated change, and the video series is a step in a better direction toward helping survivors by leaving behind the phrase “we believe survivors” for something more encompassing, Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“For me personally, believing survivors is a necessary step, but it’s not enough. It’s not sufficient. So the concept of ‘we stand with survivors’ is a commitment to support and a commitment to consistent allyship,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The videos is just one of many actions taken by I.V. community to create a safe environment for survivors and residents in general, Brandt said. This includes the hiring of an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">interpersonal violence investigator</a> in November 2018 and the signing of agreement between I.V. CSD and STESA to create a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\">survivor resource center</a> in I.V. in January.</p>\n<p>“Our community is, I think, really at the forefront of being able to create a culture where it’s both acceptable to talk frankly about these issues and also where we stand with survivors when they come forward and that we will believe them without any reservations whatsoever,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11th print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

This year, the count reported 670 sheltered and 1,133 unsheltered individuals.</p>\n<p>Additionally, 42% of the 1,133 unsheltered individuals lived in their vehicles. According to the report, the CoC interpreted this data with the help of new technologies involved in the count and demographic information provided from the New Beginnings Safe Parking Program.</p>\n<p>The program provides support and safe overnight parking for houseless individuals or families living in their vehicles, <a href=\"https://sbnbcc.org/safe-parking/\">according to the official Safe Parking page on the New Beginnings Counseling Center’s official website. </a></p>\n<p>The report also revealed, through survey questions about individuals’ last permanent residence, that the majority of the houseless population is local – meaning those individuals became houseless while living in Santa Barbara. Over 75% of current houseless people became houseless during their time of residence in Santa Barbara and 60% have resided in the county for more than 10 years, if not most of their lives.</p>\n<p>In response to the count, the County is currently drafting a plan to address houselessness, according to the count press release.</p>\n<p>“More and more, you’ll read about how the state of California is actually starting to really invest in solutions to homelessness and affordable housing,” Emily Allen, program director at United Way of Northern Santa Barbara County, said. “They are also requiring that communities have you know a P.I.T. count and that they have a plan in place and that they have strategies for evaluating how effective programs are.”</p>\n<p>The count is conducted by community volunteers recruited by the Northern Santa Barbara County United Way Home for Good, the organization which carries out the count, according to the press release. Volunteers attended a training session and then set out for the count at 5 a.m. on Jan. 2. This year, almost 450 volunteers showed up for the count in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Volunteers conducted “complete counts” and surveys, in which the volunteers, sometimes with the help of homeless guides, covered every census tract in the county, save for the Channel Islands and certain parts of the Los Padres National Forest.</p>\n<p>“Everybody is trained to either administer the survey where we ask people certain HUD-required questions, or if [a homeless person] says ‘I don’t wanna do the survey’ you’re still on your smartphone using an app,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>Volunteers could also conduct observational surveys instead of direct surveys and questioning in cases where houseless people were not comfortable answering questions.</p>\n<p>Surveying the houseless population provides insight about the conditions of houseless across communities, Allen said.</p>\n<p>“This surveying helps us to understand… who’s experiencing homelessness is fairly similar from community to community,” she said.</p>\n<p>The surveys also help United Way to better understand the varying needs of houseless individuals and how to best help them, Allen said.</p>\n<p>“We also know that the solutions are housing and supportive services and a lot of the people that do survey, they do need different types of supportive service with their housing,” she added.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County also took part in the 100,000 Homes Campaign, a country-wide effort in 2011 to create “by-name” lists of houseless people, pinpoint who the most vulnerable populations, and to ultimately house 100,000 people, Allen said.</p>\n<p>Allen and other community organizations in the Santa Barbara County “were a part of that effort… and from that we’ve continued feeling like it was important to have a lot of volunteers engaged in the Count and make sure that we were really getting information about what was going on in our community,” hence the creation of the SB County’s Home for Good program.</p>\n<p>Following the first count in 2011, one goal of the program has been to keep people engaged in a plethora of ways even after the official P.I.T. Count, in ways that will hopefully address the needs revealed by the report.</p>\n<p>“So I would say [the P.I.T Count is] not just for the federal government,” Allen said. She stated that “more and more it’s also the state government” that has begun taking a closer look at the roots and solutions to houselessness.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/","id":3720,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[3719,3718,3717],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"route":"/categories/news/county","highestPage":11}},"__N_SSG":true}
