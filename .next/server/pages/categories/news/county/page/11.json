The bill calls for an in-depth study of abandoned and unused oil wells concentrated along the Summerland and Ellwood beaches in Santa Barbara County.<br>\nJackson said the bill was inspired by a recent influx of oil onto Summerland Beach, leading to health warnings and beach closures over the past year.</p>\n<p>“This bill is a direct response to the issues we’ve been dealing with in Summerland in the oil fields there, [particularly] as a result of the Becker on-shore well which has been a problem in the Summerland area for decades,” Jackson said. “It was a well that was abandoned many years ago and was improperly capped.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, failure to properly cap the Becker on-shore well has been causing problems that affect the surrounding ocean and beaches.</p>\n<p>“This past year, it was leaking so measurably that it was creating all sorts of problems both in terms of odor it was emitting, and the crude oil that was finding its way onto the beaches and making it difficult for people to enjoy the beaches and the ocean,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the bill would allow the state to learn more about other oil wells along the California coast and about the issue of natural seepage.</p>\n<p>“This legislation requires that we study these wells to find out which ones are leaking and what it will take to cap them,” Jackson said. “Also importantly, we will study the whole issue of natural seepage to determine if there is any or more than a relatively absorbable amount.”</p>\n<p>Jackson also said SB 900 would ensure that State Lands Commission receive the funds and resources necessary to learn more about abandoned wells and cap-leaking wells.</p>\n<p>“If State Lands, which has the jurisdiction, fails to get the funding they need to cap this particular well, we will insure somewhere in the process, sooner rather than later frankly, we’ll be able to obtain the funds necessary in order to cap that well,” Jackson said. “It also gives State Lands the authority to do an analysis on the nearly 200 abandoned wells along the coast.”</p>\n<p>SB 900 is the beginning of a continuing effort to combat uncapped oil wells among the California coast, according to Jackson.</p>\n<p>“This [bill] is the beginning of the effort. If we achieve a regular funding mechanism, we hope we can address at least $2 million worth of the problem and perhaps more as we know exactly the full extent of the problem,” Jackson said. “The full time frame is yet unknown because we don’t know the full extent of the problem.”<br>\nJackson said she hopes to move the bill through the process and to the governor’s desk by the end of the 2016 State Senate session, in September.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

Barbara County Board of Supervisors allocated $128,000 in contingency funds last week for additional shelter services for the approximately 1,400 homeless individuals seeking refuge from El Niño rain storms.</p>\n<p>Proposed by County Supervisors Doreen Farr and Steve Lavagnino, the two-fold project allocates $91,000 for two daytime shelter locations and provides $37,000 for night warming centers to be available an additional 15 nights. The five warming centers, including the Isla Vista location at the University Methodist Church, have already been activated 27 out of the planned 50 nights across the county, compared to 13 nights this time last year.</p>\n<p>Farr said addressing the needs of the homeless residents could not be put off due to predictions of increasingly poor weather over the next several months.</p>\n<p>“People need to be cared for sooner, rather than later, so that they don’t get sick. In some cases with the homeless, they will die on the street if they’re not cared for,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office volunteer chaplain, also said the homeless are at risk in the winter weather.</p>\n<p>“We may not have snow and frostbite here, but it gets pretty close to it, and sooner or later that takes a toll,” Hedges said. “That’s why so many of the folks … died way before, some of them in their late 20s.”</p>\n<p>The warming centers, active Nov. 15 through Mar. 31, provide shelter from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. on nights when the overnight temperature drops below 35 degrees, there is a 50 percent chance of rain predicted for two consecutive nights or a 50 percent chance of temperatures less than 40 degrees for two consecutive nights. According to Farr, the day shelter program was developed to provide a companion piece to the warming centers.</p>\n<p>“That system has worked very well, but there was a concern that that wasn’t enough, that we needed something during the day,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>The day shelters will likely be located at Earl Warren Showgrounds and at Santa Maria’s Minami Center in North County. While these locations are less easily accessible than the five warming centers across the county, Farr said a form of transportation may be provided to shuttle homeless residents to the day centers.</p>\n<p>“We did work with some transit providers, like Easy Lift, to say if we’re able to get these day shelters up and running. If people need assistance in getting there … the people at the warming shelter at night when they’re released at 6 in the morning, we could provide a shuttle service from the warming center locations to the closest day center,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Junior Anguiano, Community Affairs Board hunger/houseless co-coordinator and second-year film and media studies and psychology double major, said it is important to provide transportation for the homeless.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them have everything they own on a bike, and you can’t just throw that on a bus and go downtown and have to make that trek,” Anguiano said. “There is no established shelter in I.V. other than the warming center.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while Reverend Frank Schaefer has been very gracious to open up the University Methodist church as a warming center, the issue of shelter for the homeless individuals in I.V. is about more than just “ducking in to get a dry place to sleep.”</p>\n<p>“The solution really is finding a place, helping us find a place, agitating with us to find a place,” Hedges said. “Also, volunteering with things like Doctors Without Walls, student health outreach, SWIPES.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said he also encourages students, when they feel safe, to reach out to homeless individuals in I.V. in small ways.</p>\n<p>“If nothing else, maybe buying somebody a cup of coffee, giving them a justification for being in the Starbucks,” Hedges said. “You know, you see some guy there cold and wet, buy him a cup of coffee.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said he wants UC Santa Barbara to “step up as a neighbor” in finding a long-term solution for housing those living on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Long range, the University is building all kinds of stuff here … In all of that development I hope there is some provision for the poor among us,” Hedges said. “Some of the [homeless] folks that have died on the street here started out as students at UCSB … I’m not looking for anyone to come riding in with a bag full of money, but at least let’s be part of the plan together.”</p>\n<p>Anguiano also said the homeless community of I.V. is very different than that of cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco and students should take the time to hear their stories and share their own.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them come here because they want to hear what college students have to say or the things we’re thinking about,” Anguiano said. “Just talking with them … one-on-one getting to know them, like you’d get to know anyone. Just because they’re houseless doesn’t take away their humanity.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

You haven’t mastered it yet,’ because the tools are there now.”</p>\n<p>Khan also said there is “a lot to be done” in terms of education, but he hopes to make his tools available to “level the playing field” for students who don’t have access to other resources.</p>\n<p>“The deck isn’t stacked against them as much as they think,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Hamza Bhatti said Khan’s videos helped him throughout high school in classes like calculus, physics and biology and his younger brother now uses the Academy.</p>\n<p>“It was really cool to hear his voice in person instead of a blackboard,” Bhatti said. “My little brother is in eighth grade right now, so he’s going to be involved with Khan Academy, and that’s why I wanted to come.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67608\" style=\"width: 342px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67608\" data-attachment-id=\"67608\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/salman-khan_by-alex-payne-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Salman Khan (Khan Academy)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67608\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3-682x1024.jpg?resize=332%2C499\" alt=\"Alex Payne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"332\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Payne / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Bhatti said he appreciated Khan’s description of his college experience, in which Khan recounted social and academic challenges.</p>\n<p>“For [Khan] to say that he submitted 40 [job] applications and didn’t get any of them, but then the 41st paid off, it was like the light of day, and something that I want to pass on to my little brother,” Bhatti said.</p>\n<p>Wan Pei Fung, second-year biology major and exchange student from Singapore, said she attended the event because she uses Khan’s videos both at UCSB and in Singapore.</p>\n<p>“I really used a lot of [Khan’s] videos for chemistry and physics so I wanted to come and learn more about Khan Academy,” Fung said.</p>\n<p>Fung said Khan’s statement that “anything worth doing is something you can fail at” encouraged her to take on challenges.</p>\n<p>“For me, I don’t want to do something because I know I’m not good at it, like physics and computer science,” Fung said. “But after that, I realized that I have to try, and that failing might be a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Sydni Baker said that her favorite part of Khan’s lecture was his message to students to participate in activities they enjoy.</p>\n<p>“I feel, like, validated.

Theatre in Santa Barbara on Jan. 24 to speak about the education offered at Khan Academy.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy is a nonprofit educational organization that aims to provide free education through online videos and practice exercises. Khan, who holds degrees from MIT and Harvard and is a former hedge fund analyst, created the Academy in 2005 as a tool to help tutor his cousins and expanded the idea into a web-based educational organization.</p>\n<p>Roman Baratiak, Associate Director of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, said in an email that Khan brings an optimistic message about the future of learning in relation to modern technology.</p>\n<p>“Arts &amp; Lectures invited Salman Khan because of his visionary work rethinking existing assumptions about education and his work connecting students to the digital age,” Baratiak said.</p>\n<p>Carina Salaiz, a second-year biology major, said Khan Academy videos often pertain to science, technology, engineering and mathematics education (S.T.E.M.) and were integral to her academic journey as a S.T.E.M. student.</p>\n<p>“I’ve used his videos so many times in the past for bio, calculus, chemistry,” Salaiz said. “They’re way more extensive and in-depth than other ‘how-to’ videos … you can find them on YouTube and they’re completely free.”</p>\n<p>Salaiz said Khan’s knowledge of technology helped make his program more accessible and understandable than any other educational organizations.</p>\n<p>“I feel like other nonprofit [organizations] need to step up their game and use more web outlets to reach out to more people,” Salaiz said. “It’s the easiest way and it’s cool how Khan utilizes that. I am definitely really inspired by his work.”</p>\n<p>Mao Chun Cheng, second-year political science major, said he appreciated Khan for using modern technology in a user-friendly way to assist students.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s a really honorable thing to want everybody to be educated,” Cheng said. “There’s no better way to reach out to kids struggling in school than YouTube videos and really nicely formatted websites.”</p>\n<p>Alyssa Sahu, second-year biology major, recounted the time when Khan visited her high school and said she appreciates how Khan opens up his program to students of all ages.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good speaker and he was really engaging,” Sahu said. “My friend’s little brother was actually featured on his website! I think Khan features smart kids once in a while to showcase kids that have used his program and have advanced in their own way.”</p>\n<p>Tickets for the lecture are available online or at the Arts &amp; Lectures ticket office on campus. Tickets are $16 for students and $28-$43 for the general public.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

deputies have been testing body-worn video cameras for about a year, and all 16 may be wearing the cameras in the spring, according to Sol Linver, commander of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping by the end of next quarter we’ll have an idea which [camera to purchase],” Linver said. This would begin the next phase of the body camera pilot program, outfitting all Santa Barbara County deputies who are “not routinely in cars” with one of five potential body camera brands, something Linver hopes to do by April. The department has been evaluating the use of body cameras over the last year, attempting to determine the most effective camera, select an affordable managing program and server for viewing and storing video and obtain the money to purchase these items.</p>\n<p>Police departments across the country have increasingly turned to body cameras amid calls for transparency from activists and politicians after a series of highly publicized and controversial deaths at the hands of police in Ferguson, Mo., Staten Island, N.Y. and Baltimore. Linver said this sudden spike in demand forced camera companies to hastily develop and sell cameras, flooding the market with subpar products.</p>\n<p>Now that the initial eagerness of police departments is ebbing, Linver said, officials are “starting to slow everybody down” and ask for a camera “that’s going to last — not something that’s just going to go out there so we can say we have body cameras.”</p>\n<p>Los Angeles officials recently balked at approving a $57 million <a href=\"http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2015/15-0479-S2_misc_1_11-25-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> to purchase more than 6,000 body cameras for the LAPD. City council members delayed the vote amid critics’ concerns that the city relied too heavily on another county’s pilot program and only tested two camera brands itself.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department has taken a different approach, independently evaluating five brands of body cameras — VidMic, VidCam, BodyCam, TASER and COBAN — based on durability, nighttime video quality, charging time, battery life, time and date stamping, internal memory, still image quality and more.</p>\n<p>“We chose to do the pilot project and do this right before we go out there and spend a great deal of money on cameras,” said Linver, who was also the project manager of the pilot program. “I don’t want to spend 20 or 30 thousand dollars on cameras that are only going to last one year. That’s not being frugal — that’s not what the taxpayers expect from us.”</p>\n<p>Linver emphasized the importance of thoroughly evaluating each product during the trial before committing to one brand. He pointedly recalled one camera model having “major software issues” until the company’s CEO traveled to Santa Barbara and replaced all of the faulty cameras with newer versions.</p>\n<p>A flawed camera was a hassle then, but during interactions between police officers and civilians, a flaw could mean losing crucial evidence.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking for something that can handle rain, can handle dust, can handle jarring,” Linver said. “If I’ve got a deputy who’s rolling around — unfortunately — with someone on the ground or involved in a fight, I don’t want the camera to just stop. That’s really when I need it.”</p>\n<p>Linver said the cameras range from about $200 for the TASER brand to nearly $500 for the VidMic, but that the greatest expense is in storing recorded video.</p>\n<p>The department estimates that each camera will produce, on average, slightly less than two terabytes of data per year, roughly equivalent to half a million songs in an iTunes library. Linver said in December that he had just purchased a 72 TB server for $24,000 to store video from car and body-worn cameras.</p>\n<p>Linver said he had looked into federal grants — which almost exclusively apply to the hardware, rather than storage expenses — and also plans to explore other means of funding, such as drawing from the department’s general fund or requesting funds from the county Board of Supervisors or Police Foundation.</p>\n<p>Matthew West, a deputy at the IVFP station, voluntarily purchased his own body camera in November of 2014 and said he uses it as an aid to write detailed reports and protect himself from potentially unfounded claims of excessive force.</p>\n<p>“With everything that’s been going on in the media, obviously I know what I’m doing is right, but I want to protect myself,” West said. “I don’t want it to be my word against their word. Times have changed, and if I have video and it clearly shows something, that’s what happened, it’s on the video.”</p>\n<p>West said he thought officers in the foot patrol office were generally supportive of implementing body cameras, and said he “highly recommends” using them in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Especially out here is where they’re needed, because [IVFP has] one car with a video camera, but 90 percent of the time, we’re walking around,” West said.</p>\n<p>The IVFP office comprises the largest group of deputies in the county who spend the majority of their time on bicycle or on foot, according to Linver.</p>\n<p>Linver said deputies are increasingly seeing cameras as an “important, helpful tool,” and deputies in places like Goleta and Carpinteria have purchased their own cameras as well.</p>\n<p>“Ten or 12 years ago … you had some deputies who wanted to drive the car where the camera didn’t work,” Linver said. “Now they’re all like, ‘Hey, my camera doesn’t work, I don’t want to go out there in the field,’ because our deputies nowadays realize the benefit of having video.”</p>\n<p>West said his body camera, made by Wolfcom, allows him to pay more attention to people rather than being buried in his notepad.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to take such accurate notes because ultimately you’re going to have everything on video,” West said. “If it’s a pretty complex case or investigation, you can get specific quotes from people when you’re writing your report.”</p>\n<p>Section 450.9 of the department’s policy manual, parts of which were obtained through a public records request by the<em> Daily Nexus</em>, states members of the sheriff’s office “should review their recordings as a resource” when preparing written reports.</p>\n<p>“With perception, sometimes you look at a video and you say, ‘oh, that’s what happened,’” Linver said. “When there is a complaint filed against an officer or deputy, [recordings are] a tool that we can look at.”</p>\n<p>“There are also times where officers will do things wrong,” Linver said. “Sometimes they don’t know the things they’re doing are wrong, and we work with training and things to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”</p>\n<p>The department’s policy manual also says, “Uniformed members should wear the recorder in a conspicuous manner or otherwise notify persons that they are being recorded, whenever possible.”</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Jeffrey Greene said that citizens’ behavior can change when they know they are being recorded.</p>\n<p>“You tell them, ‘I’m recording you, so keep up what you’re doing and let the judge or your parents see that,’ and immediately, their behavior changes,” Greene said, adding that this tactic is not as effective in I.V., where unruly students are often “already drunk and typically beyond caring mode.”</p>\n<p>Whether a body camera is a deputy’s personal device or part of the pilot program, the recordings are uploaded to the department’s server and could potentially be used in investigations.</p>\n<p>Greene said video recordings are retained by the department for three years, unless they are “deemed necessary for some type of criminal [investigation] or tagged for evidence in a crime.”</p>\n<p>Linver said he had already used body camera footage from the pilot program in a “use of force” investigation in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Joyce Dudley, Santa Barbara County’s district attorney, said she always welcomes more evidence, but that body cameras may not be as conclusive as some expect.</p>\n<p>“Whether [body cameras] would further justice or not is yet to be seen,” Dudley said. “Think about filmmakers — filmmakers choose their angle, filmmakers choose what they want to portray, and I think it’s the same thing for cell phone video and body cameras.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said she has seen juries perceive video to be an infallible piece of evidence, when it may not tell the whole story.</p>\n<p>“Because I’ve seen the other part — that is, [footage] only from a certain angle and for a certain amount of time — I’ve seen injustice,” Dudley said. “I’m very frustrated with body cams because with witnesses,  juries could sit there and watch people as they describe what happened and judge their credibility, and now juries are more likely to just believe the videotape and not judge what they saw.”</p>\n<p>For this reason, Dudley said, it’s important that any witnesses with footage of a controversial event make their video accessible.</p>\n<p>“The more tapes we have, the better,” Dudley said. “Get those tapes in.”</p>\n<p>A version of

featuring Grammy-nominated NEEDTOBREATHE and Johnnyswim at the Granada Theater this weekend.</p>\n<p>KHK is run by Advanced Placement Economics students at San Marcos High School (SMHS). The organization aims to help children in need by raising money at fundraising events throughout Santa Barbara. The Benefit Gala Concert is their flagship annual event, and it has featured popular, award winning artists such as Andy Grammer and Sara Bareilles. This year, KHK also hosted a car raffle and a silent auction, raising a total of $460,000.</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Chloe Allen said though some KHK members worried the concert would not have a good turnout, the event was successful.</p>\n<p>“When we saw people slowly coming in, we were scared that we were going to have a lot of empty seats and the energy wouldn’t be that great,” Allen said. “But after Johnnyswim came on, they did a great job of setting the tone for the night and when NEEDTOBREATHE came on, everyone was so into it.”</p>\n<p>KHK Director of Outreach and SMHS senior Olivia Jones said the event “crushed” the organization’s fundraising goal of $350,000.</p>\n<p>“I can confidently say that I have never been so proud in my entire life with how the concert turned out,” Jones said in email. “We were able to raise $461,000 this year, and that is something not many high school seniors can or ever will say.”</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Allison Bliss said she was surprised to see such a diverse crowd at the concert.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67273\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67273\" data-attachment-id=\"67273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/nonprofit-hosts-concert-to-benefit-children-in-need/kidshelpingkidssb_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452284265\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kids Helping Kids SB\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67273\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x684.jpg?resize=500%2C334\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“There were so many different types of people in the crowd — people [from] different states even — and they all came together and their energy was amazing,” Bliss said. “I was personally in the crowd at the very end and everyone was just so hyped and happy to be there.”</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Emily Imperato said the event was successful due to KHK members’ hard work and cooperation.</p>\n<p>“The event went really well because so many people were working so hard backstage and through the entire thing and it executed perfectly,” Imperato said. “We got exactly what we were looking for, the stage looked great, the artists were great and so the hard work paid off.”</p>\n<p>Imperto said the silent auction on the second floor of the theater was “packed” with bidders.</p>\n<p>“It went really well and there were so many people bidding for so many items,” Imperato said. “All the items were donated to us, and every single bid — that money goes straight to kids locally and globally.”</p>\n<p>Granada Theater staff member Stephanie Staud said the event improved upon the previous year’s concert.</p>\n<p>“They were way better with their planning. Everything just fell into place,” Staud said. “All the kids were super focused.

The pop-up store has operated since 1968 and is run entirely by artists who apply each year to have their work featured. On Dec. 3 from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. the store is hosting its annual event to mark the first Thursday of December, featuring live music, wine and appetizers and allowing customers to meet the artists.</p>\n<p>Susan Dunbar, the current manager of the store and former UCSB student, said what makes The Yes Store special is cooperation and the “legwork that nobody sees.”</p>\n<p>“For me it’s just amazing to see everybody pull together in a big group and make it happen,” Dunbar said. “‘Cause we typically only have a week or two to build the desk, get your booths in, stock it and then we open.”</p>\n<p>Dunbar, who first began working for the store after graduating college in 1981, said she appreciates watching multiple generations of Santa Barbara locals enjoy the store.</p>\n<p>“We’re unique in the way that we’ve been doing this for so long, so we see families grow up and come back and bring their children and buy art,” Dunbar said.</p>\n<p>The Yes Store employee Wendy Wagner said she tries to create a connection between shoppers and artists.</p>\n<p>“I’m a floor sales person but I consider myself an artist facilitator,” Wagner said. “I try to encourage people to know a little bit about the artists when they’re looking at their work so that that might help them purchasing their little treasures from these people.”</p>\n<p>Wagner said the store has undergone considerable expansion since last year and is always encouraging new artists to join.</p>\n<p>“We have 10 new artists this year so there’s a lot of new product in the store; we’re really excited about that,” Wagner said. “We like the expansion process, and, if any artists are interested in being in The Yes Store, we have a book that you can sign your name and then be notified next year when the jury process begins.”</p>\n<p>Long-time customer Stella Larson said she loves the quality of the store’s products, as well as being able to give back to the Santa Barbara art community.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coming at least 42 years and I always look for my favourite people and then I look for the new people; it’s a wonderful thing. It’s all local artisans, everything is handmade — it’s really wonderful quality,” Larson said. “It helps the artist and it helps keep art going in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Local resident Trina Diaz said the store is well-known in the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>“I grew up here and it’s been going on forever,” Diaz said, “Locals all know about the [The] Yes Store so they look forward to it every year.”</p>\n<p>Diaz added that the store is a great opportunity for local artists to gain more exposure.</p>\n<p>“It’s a wonderful place for local artists to display their talent and for people to come and see that from all over the world,” Diaz said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/","id":3865,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[3864,3863,3862],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AB 935 To Allow Special Identification for Veterans","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/veteranID.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/veteranID.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Assembly Bill 935 took effect Friday, allowing United States military veterans to apply for a California driver’s license or identification card with a veteran designation.

Veterans can apply for a new driver’s license or ID card by bringing their DD-214 to a County Veterans Service Office and making an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The DMV requires veterans to pay a $5 application fee.</p>\n<p>According to California State Assemblymember Jim Frazier, who authored AB 935, the bill allows Californians to fulfill their “responsibility” of ensuring veterans are “well-equipped” for civilian life.</p>\n<p>“Assembly Bill 935 helps us fulfill that pledge to our veterans,” Frazier said in a statement. “Proof of military service is now literally at the individual’s fingertips, which will help ensure that California veterans are receiving all the benefits they’re rightfully entitled to.”</p>\n<p>U.S. Army veteran and engineering graduate student Paul Malone said this legislation frees veterans from needing to have DD-214 certificates on hand in order to enjoy benefits, which he said is a “dumb thing,” because the discharge certificate is a sensitive document, comparable to a birth certificate or Social Security card.</p>\n<p>“Most people carry their licenses with them, which makes this a common sense fix to a problem within our community, assuming it is honored as valid proof,” Malone said in an email.</p>\n<p>Malone said he worries that California lawmakers will “hang their hat” on veterans’ laws now that AB 935’s has passed.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot more to be done just to catch up to other states in terms of what they’re doing for veterans,” Malone said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB Veteran Resource Center counselor and religious studies graduate student Sam Reid said the new veteran license and ID is ultimately “not that big of a deal” for veterans like himself who already carry a United States Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) identification card.</p>\n<p>“If I already have the card, I don’t really need the indicator,” Reid said. “It’s a cool thing, but it’s not some revolutionary game-changer.”</p>\n<p>Reid said he will add the designation to his driver’s license the next time he renews his license at the DMV.</p>\n<p>“I will do that when I renew my license, but I won’t go out of my way,” Reid said.</p>\n<p>U.S. Navy veteran and Chican@ studies Ph.D. candidate Delores Mondragón said AB 935 will especially help female veterans.</p>\n<p>According to Mondragón, she and her husband once tried to get a free coffee at Starbucks on Veterans Day as part of a promotion, and an employee asked Mondragón for pictures of her in uniform, but did not ask her husband for the same.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s an important thing to have, especially for female veterans,” Mondragón said. “I think we have a much harder time being legitimized as veterans.”</p>\n<p>Mondragón also said female veterans are less likely carry alternate forms of identification offered by veteran organizations such as the V.A., the Veterans of Foreign Wars or the American Legion, as they often avoid these organizations because they are “saturated with men.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of women veterans don’t like to be around that many men anymore, especially if we’re the only ones amidst a thousand men,” Mondragón said.</p>\n<p>Mondragón said her biggest concern is that the DMV is charging veterans to apply to add the designation, which she said seems like a “profiteering” scheme.</p>\n<p>“They’re going to make a profit off of what we thought was inherently a necessity in our community,” Mondragón said. “You’re going to have all these veterans pay to let people know that they’re veterans. That’s the part that I just am in complete disagreement with — I think it should be free.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Conference on Saturday at the church’s State Street location to provide engaging workshops for middle and high school-age LGBTQ youth and their families.</p>\n<p>The free conference, which ran from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., included a variety of workshops for both children and their parents. The parent workshops included a mental health forum led by two clinicians, a panel on LGBTQ youth health and a PFLAG, previously known as Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, discussion on how to be a supportive ally for LGBTQ youth. The youth workshops included a sexual education discussion, a college panel on identity expression and a series of “coming out” monologues. There was also a tutorial on “dragging” and a drag performance closed the conference.</p>\n<p>Reverend Alyssa De Wolf said attendees of all ages were able to benefit from the conference, particularly parents of LGBTQ youth.</p>\n<p>“I think the parents especially had a lot of time to meet other adults and other people who are working with LGBTQ students and I think got a lot of extra resources today too,” De Wolf said. “We’re trying to really strengthen not just the kids, but really strengthen the people who are working with kids so that we can be a better and stronger community.”</p>\n<p>De Wolf said she hopes the church’s future LGBTQ Youth Conferences will be longer and feature more speakers.</p>\n<p>“My vision is that it grows and grows,” De Wolf said. “I envision bringing in bigger speakers, more people, doing it maybe even more than one day, but really getting the word out and making it the sort of thing people come to every year and that kids especially get excited about every year.”</p>\n<p>Drag performer and 2012 Santa Barbara Queen of Pride Deja Re said she hoped kids left the conference feeling sure of their environment.</p>\n<p>“I think them having this safe place to go to and to really express themselves is great,” Re said. “It’s so great to see these kids at such a young age really know who they are and who they want to be.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Isabelle Tranner said she learned from people sharing their experiences of coming out to their friends and families.</p>\n<p>“I really liked sitting in on the ‘coming out’ panel,” Tranner said. “It was just people discussing their experiences coming out, and some of the issues and joys of coming out and that was really interesting to hear, especially from people younger than me.”</p>\n<p>Director of the Santa Barbara Transgender Advocacy Network Rachel Gloger said she hopes LGBTQ youth can feel physically and mentally safe and fully accept their identities.</p>\n<p>“The more safe spaces we can provide for these kids, the stronger their sense of community will be and the stronger their mental health outcomes are,” Gloger said. “I think the outcome of these events is just letting our town know that we have a lot of LGBT kids that we’re really proud of, and we’re proud to support them.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66270\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/local-church-hosts-lgbtq-youth-conference/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66270\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/local-church-hosts-lgbtq-youth-conference/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/local-church-hosts-lgbtq-youth-conference/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/local-church-hosts-lgbtq-youth-conference/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/local-church-hosts-lgbtq-youth-conference/","id":3857,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[3856,3855,3854],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":11,"route":"/categories/news/county","highestPage":11}},"__N_SSG":true}
