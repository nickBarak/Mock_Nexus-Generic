Elementary and Santa Catalina. The crosswalks will include a signal light for drivers and “walking hand” clearance for pedestrians in the 25 mph school zone.</p>\n<p>The new concept replaces one of two existing right-turn lanes onto Storke Road with a “pork chop island,” a raised triangular partition, at the end of a new crosswalk into the Santa Catalina complex.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71833\" style=\"width: 908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"794268775\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71820\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71833\" data-attachment-id=\"71833\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/screen-shot-2016-07-07-at-10-04-06-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?fit=898%2C694&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,694\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-07-07 at 10.04.06 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71833 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?resize=888%2C686\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?resize=768%2C594&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The “pork chop” island, marked (A) will replace the existing second turn lane leading into Storke Road. <em>Courtesy of UCSB</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB will experience a shift in population to the west edge of campus over the next five years, and along with a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BICYCLE-CIRCULATION-@-STORKE-EL-COLEGIO-RD.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new bike path </a>that wraps around the San Joaquin apartments, the university has chosen the crosswalk plan to create easy access between the two sides of El Colegio and Storke Roads.</p>\n<p>“It’s a safety issue for students and staff who will be going back and forth between the two areas,” said Marc Fisher, vice chancellor for administration, speaking to an audience of about 60 Isla Vista and Goleta residents at a town hall meeting in I.V. Elementary on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Residents of Isla Vista, however, are concerned that the single turn lane and island will create traffic buildup in the area during rush hour, finals week, move-in and move-out weekends and graduation.</p>\n<p>“There’s so much for them to figure out, and they’re so little,” said the mother of an eight-year-old child who attends the I.V. Elementary. “It’s overwhelming. Just to think about my child crossing all these areas … I don’t think he’ll be able to do this kind of stuff.”</p>\n<p>One meeting attendee insisted that the current plan furthered “the college interest and not the elementary school interest,” and another suggested that the most logical, long-term solution to benefit the community was a pedestrian bridge.</p>\n<p>“What has happened to those cones [at the intersection] will happen to our children,” said Felipe Garcia, a 20-year resident of I.V. “Every single one of those cones has been hit.”</p>\n<p>According to Derek Rapp, a Stantec engineer who is overseeing the construction, the company considered children when drawing up their plans, and the crosswalk will work to improve an already low statistic of four accidents at the intersection in the past five years.</p>\n<p>If the proposed changes come to fruition, I.V. Elementary will potentially need two more crossing guards, and several students who live at Santa Catalina and San Joaquin will be directed to park at Lot 50, Lot 30 and Lot 38 to decongest the intersection.</p>\n<p>Fisher also said that the university will place a “de-emphasis on cars and a strong emphasis on bicycle and bus circulation” as over 3,000 beds are added to Santa Catalina and San Joaquin housing over the next year.</p>\n<p>The university is paying for construction and design of the new project and Santa Barbara County has the authority to approve all necessary permits. The construction is projected to be complete by the start of the I.V. Elementary school year on Aug. 23.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to get this up and operational for this fall, so it needs to keep moving,” Fisher said. “Personally, I feel this is going to be far safer than the current condition.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71820\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71820\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/","id":3901,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3900,3899,3898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sorority and Isla Vista Pastor Honored by Red Cross","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Red-Cross-Photo-Courtesy-Morris-Franklin-PRINT-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Red-Cross-Photo-Courtesy-Morris-Franklin-PRINT-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Alpha Delta Pi earned the Lifesaving Blood Hero award for its biannual blood drives, and the Rev.

Jon-Stephen Hedges, the pastor who was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-07/ucsb-student-charged-with-assaulting-pastor-in-isla-vista/\" target=\"_blank\">assaulted</a> by a UC Santa Barbara student in his Isla Vista home last month, and the Gamma Xi chapter of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The sorority, established in 1950 as one of UCSB’s original seven sororities, has been hosting blood drives for the last five years as part of its philanthropic work. The sorority was awarded the Lifesaving Blood Hero award for its members’ efforts.</p>\n<p>For the last two years, the Alpha Delta Pi has held a blood drive in both the fall and spring quarters. During its most recent blood drive, 87 students and Isla Vistans donated hundreds of pints of blood to the Red Cross.</p>\n<p>“It is a constant need in our community,” Danielle Moss, the sorority’s philanthropy chair, said, having donated blood since she was first eligible in high school.</p>\n<p>Sarah Whitman, the sorority’s recruitment and marketing vice president, said that, at times, encouraging blood donations is easier than trying to procure financial contributions.</p>\n<p>“Asking people to donate blood is easier than asking people to donate money,” Whitman, a second-year psychology and sociology double major, said at the Carr Vineyards and Winery in downtown Santa Barbara, which hosted the reception for Red Cross honorees.</p>\n<p>Whitman noted that the Red Cross is one of the sorority’s many philanthropic endeavors. Alpha Delta Pi regularly fundraises for the Ronald McDonald House and has members participating in charity dance marathons and UCSB’s Relay for Life, which raised nearly $10,000 for cancer research.</p>\n<p>Moss said the blood donations were successful, in part, because sorority members “blasted it all over social media,” saturating students’ news feeds with information about the drive. She said it was an honor to be rewarded by the greater Santa Barbara community, adding that Greek life is often subject to “bad media coverage.”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing to be recognized outside of UCSB,” Moss, a third-year sociology major, said. “Sororities are one of the most social circles, and you can either put that to waste or use the power of numbers to give back.”</p>\n<p>The Red Cross also awarded Hedges, known locally as Father Jon, and four other chaplains with the Disaster Services Hero award. Hedges, who volunteers as a chaplain for Isla Vista Foot Patrol and other agencies, is a UCSB alumnus and has lived in Isla Vista since 1968.</p>\n<p>Hedges was assaulted in May by a UCSB student, Paul Gusman, who forced his way into the reverend’s house and repeatedly punched him in the face. Hedges said he believes Gusman is “a good kid” and that drugs “took over him, and that’s a game changer for his life.”</p>\n<p>Hedges mentioned the 2014 Isla Vista shooting as an example of when chaplains are vital to emergency workers and community members suffering from a tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We get called in those moments not to be all religious, but to be a calm presence,” Hedges said. “I’m not there to teach Sunday school, I’m there to be more of a psychologist.”</p>\n<p>The Rev. Mort Ward, who advises all Red Cross chaplains in the Central Coast area, presented the award Wednesday night and encouraged attendees to keep emergency respondents in their thoughts.</p>\n<p>When pulling over for an ambulance or fire truck, Ward said, “if you’re a person of faith, send a prayer and, if not, send a good thought.”</p>\n<p>“The people you see to my right,” Ward said, motioning to the chaplains at the front of the room, “take that prayer or good thought a step forward … because that is what is so desperately needed at that moment.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared

Sanders (I–Vt.) will speak to SBCC students and residents of Santa Barbara from The Great Meadow on SBCC’s West Campus, a large plot of grass overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>The rally, titled “A Future to Believe In,” is free and open to the public. Doors open for the event at 7 a.m.</p>\n<p>Sanders’s campaign said in a statement that Sanders will be speaking about money in politics, climate change, health care and how to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) said the 15x, an express line between UC Santa Barbara and SBCC, will not be running on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Cynthia Boche, assistant planning manager at MTD, said none of the Saturday buses will get UCSB students to SBCC by 7 a.m., but that students may be able to arrive by 8. Boche said she expects an influx of passengers on Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of people from Isla Vista will be wanting to get to the event,” she said.</p>\n<p>UCSB students can take the Line 11 bus to the downtown Transit Center and then take Line 4 or Line 17 to SBCC.</p>\n<p>Actor Danny DeVito, who has endorsed Sanders, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/danny-devito-talks-voting-bernie-sanders-isla-vista-in-the-sixties/\" target=\"_blank\">drew</a> hundreds of UCSB students to The Arbor for several hours last week, telling them it was important to vote in the California Democratic primary on June 7.</p>\n<p>People planning to see Sanders at SBCC should not bring bags, signs or banners and should limit belongings to small items like keys and phones, the candidate’s campaign said.</p>\n<p>After speaking at SBCC, Sanders will head 60 miles north to address supporters at Santa Maria High School’s Wilson Stadium.

Within two weeks of the pipe rupture, workers and volunteers found 87 birds, 11 dolphins and 42 sea lions that had died as a result of the oil spill, according to the Bren Hall panel.</p>\n<p>The beaches have since reopened and the oil is all but gone from the shore. However, researchers continue to periodically collect balls of tar for analysis, a process known as tarball fingerprinting.</p>\n<p>“There are some issues with that analysis, because, at this point, a lot of the tarballs are very weathered,” said Jenna Driscoll of Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, a nonprofit organization working to protect and restore the Channel.</p>\n<p>Being able to distinguish whether a tarball originates from the Line 901 spill or if it is simply part of a natural oil slick is an important factor in allowing scientists to determine the extent of the damage and how long the cleanup will last. However, at this point there is no definitive technology that permits researchers to distinguish the exact origin of a particular tarball.</p>\n<p>“Those samples should be used to identify response rather than impact,” Driscoll said. “There does have to be some formal method of closing response efforts. A year out, you no longer need to send people to the beaches to respond to oil coming up on the shore.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Response</strong><br>\nState-designed plans are supposed to account for cleanup operations, but environmental groups say the plans were not adequate for the specific situation.</p>\n<p>After the Refugio spill, there was largely a lack of coordinated response between state and federal agencies, county organizers and local environmental groups, according to Linda Krop, chief counsel at the Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We were completely floored with the lack of on-the-ground response,” Krop said. “On the evening of the 19th, not a soul was doing cleanup; the beach was full of oil and every wave was taking oil out to sea.”</p>\n<p>After attending state and federal briefings the morning after the spill, Krop said the state and federal regulations for spill responses were not adequate in addressing the immediate action required in the aftermath of the Refugio spill.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really have a plan in place for when you have a spill that starts onshore and threatens to go offshore,” Krop said. “That’s one of the things we need to work on.”</p>\n<p>Since then, both Santa Barbara County officials and local environmental organizations have worked to implement more substantial plans of action that dictate immediate cleanup efforts to take place in the event of an oil spill.</p>\n<p>“The response is still ongoing through the end of this calendar year. We still have county personnel out on the main impact site, going out and assessing that area for impact,” Robert Troy, deputy director for the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management, said. “We’ve been working diligently for the past few months and will continue to do so.”</p>\n<p><strong>Legal and Economic Repercussions</strong><br>\nEnvironmental legislation is often passed in the wake of some sort of natural or manmade disaster, such as in the case of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill.</p>\n<p>Following the Refugio spill, several local groups worked alongside the county and the state, pushing for both new state and national legislation to more strictly enforce environmental protection.</p>\n<p>“We’ve continued to work tirelessly, even a year after the spill, to move legislation forward and to work with these environmental agencies to improve response efforts as well as education and outreach,” Driscoll said.</p>\n<p>Their efforts led to the passing of state laws SB 295, AB 864 and the Rapid Oil Spill Response Act (SB 414), all of which are meant to create a faster and more effective response to a future oil spill. In addition, the Pipeline Safety Act (HR 5050) was passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee at the federal legislative level, which increases the frequency of inline pipeline inspection in ecologically rich areas.</p>\n<p>“As a law firm we were looking at various legal issues,” Krop said. “We looked at the regulations that apply to these pipelines, we learned that the federal regulations for this particular pipeline are much weaker than what we do in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, May 19, 2016 print edition of

Marjorie Luke Theatre on gun violence in America and what can be done to address the “profit-driven crisis” causing mass shootings, domestic violence, suicide and accidents across America.</span></p>\n<p>The panel discussion, which followed a screening of the film “Making a Killing: Guns, Greed, and the NRA,” included the film’s director, Robert Greenwald; State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson; Assemblymember Das Williams; Mayor Helene Schneider; Toni Wellen, chairwoman of the SB Coalition Against Gun Violence; and Bob Weiss, father of UCSB student Veronica Weiss who was killed in the Isla Vista mass murder in May 2014. The film, which brought many members of the audience to tears, was released on March 15 by Brave New Films and has since been screened at over 500 schools, churches and meeting centers across the country, according to Greenwald.</p>\n<p>Greenwald said he hopes the film will contribute to a change in culture similar to what was seen in years past with the use of cigarettes or the need for seatbelts in cars.</p>\n<p>“Nobody thought we could beat the cigarette companies, nobody thought we would beat the automobile companies when they tried to convince us you don’t need safety belts,” Greenwald said. “One day, we will look back with the same belief and awareness that we stopped and changed the culture of guns.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said the notion that anybody can own a gun needs to be revisited.</p>\n<p>“We need to take another look at what the Second Amendment says. It says ‘a well regulated militia’ being necessary to the security of a free state and the right of the individual to bear arms shall not be infringed,” Jackson said. “It will be up to states like California … to stay one step ahead of this issue and try and get a renewal of the definition of the Second Amendment that is more rational, logical and takes on the NRA.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLQ9B-p5Q-YOP8cqdpXcO_yrWTY8ZAB4eq&amp;hl=en_US\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked by an audience member what he believes might have prevented the shooting in Isla Vista, Weiss said he had done a lot of thinking about that question and studied all the information he could find.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A few of the facts really stand out,” he said. “One is that law enforcement was aware of this killer and had several contacts with him over the course of the preceding year. The parents of the killer called the sheriff’s office and asked for a wellness check, which was done. It took about 15 minutes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weiss said the wellness check completed by the sheriff’s office was “poorly done.”</span></p>\n<p>“They never asked the killer if he had a gun, they never walked out to their squad car to run his name to see if he had a gun. That information could have been very valuable. When their therapist and their parents are calling the sheriff’s office and the sheriff’s office does a 15-minute cursory review and walks away, I don’t know what to add to that. It was a massive failure.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the ability of one-third of the legislature to block any form of taxation prevents those working to prevent gun violence from coming up with new solutions.</p>\n<p>“One-third of the legislature blocks all forms of taxation, including ones that could make us safer, including ones that could provide revenue that is otherwise unavailable to make basic improvements in either our data basing, our investigations, our law enforcement,” Williams said. “I can tell you that most of our communities do not have adequate funding for law enforcement, and a tax on ammunition to fund that sort of investigation is a great idea and one that I would support.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69669\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69669\" data-attachment-id=\"69669\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/activists-address-gun-violence-as-profit-driven-crisis/bravenewfilms-moviepanel-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BraveNewFilms Movie+Panel\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69669\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Making-a-Killing-Panel_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69669\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Sen. Jackson added that there is “no political will” in California to pass legislation that would limit firearms.</p>\n<p>“We can’t get a two-thirds vote on almost any tax, and, frankly, there is not a single Republican vote I can think of in the legislature that would support any implementation of any limitations on firearms and certainly not imposing a tax.” Jackson said. “That’s double negative for the Republican party, a tax and then doing anything to challenge the gun lobby.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she was proud to co-author Assembly Bill 1014 (AB 1014) with Williams, legislation that would allow firearms to be temporarily removed from individuals who are at risk of committing acts of violence.</p>\n<p>“The measure would allow family members, when they know that their loved ones are in distress, to be able to contact the police to get restraining orders that would remove any access to firearms that they might have,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, the effectiveness of AB 1014 depends on databases which deal with the registration of guns and prohibited persons: people who are under restraining orders, have mental illness issues or have committed crimes for which they are prohibited from owning a firearms.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of the problem is that we do not have the resources for these databases,” Jackson said. “The ability to get those databases up and running effectively has been significantly limited over the course of the years, and we need to reinvest in those things so that the police have greater confidence when they go to do a wellness check, when they go to check if someone is a prohibited person, that those databases are complete, they’re accurate and they’re up to date.”</span></p>\n<p>Wellen said Santa Barbarans cannot forget that there has been more than one mass shooting in the area in recent years, recalling a woman who killed six people at the post office in Goleta in 2006.</p>\n<p>“That woman was found to be mentally unstable, and she was under involuntary hold and unable to purchase a gun in California, but she went to New Mexico where no questions were asked and she came back here and she killed six people,” Wellen said. “We must always remember that we have had more than one mass shooting in our community, so we are all touched by gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Greenwald said that while he admires the Santa Barbara legislators for having the “brains and guts and the mindset” to work toward a solution, it will take more than just strong legislation to stop gun violence.</p>\n<p>“We must look at it for what it is, it’s a public health crisis and the way public health crises are solved and fixed and handled are from a multiple of ways,” Greenwald said. “Laws are there, you need a variety of laws, there are many different situations, and fundamentally, fundamentally we have to say these are weapons that kill, and they should not be so easily available to everyone.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We must always remember that we have had more than one mass shooting in our community, so we are all touched by gun violence.” – Toni Wellen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mayor Schneider said gun violence in the U.S. has become so common that Americans are “desensitized” to it.</p>\n<p>“We are the only country in the world really who has this kind of senseless kind of gun violence—you don’t see this in other countries,” Schneider said. “There were 330 [mass shootings] in 2015. I mean, there were 35 days in that year that didn’t have a mass shooting. That’s it. We turn on the radio or you watch the news and you hear about something that happened somewhere in the country and it was just another one, it feels like.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said it is critically important, when discussing the issue of guns in America, to address the culture of violence in society today.</p>\n<p>“If you take a look at the games that our kids are playing, it is absolutely horrifying,” Jackson said. “The problem is that young people today are playing these violent games, the movies are so graphic, so violent; the more people you can kill, the better.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, if children are not taught to understand the effects of gun violence on a personal level, the number of deaths resulting from firearms in America will not change.</p>\n<p>“We are not teaching our young people enough about compassion and empathy so that they recognize that if, in fact, someone were to die, it would devastate. If it were they that lost a sibling or a parent, what that would mean to them,” Jackson said. “In the world we live in today with the proliferation of firearms, if we don’t teach children and others what the consequences are of having those firearms, of considering or using them, we will continue to see 30,000 people a year killed by gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the NRA does not have more resources than those working for limitations on firearms.</p>\n<p>“Their hardcore numbers are actually pretty small, but they mobilize on the issue, they vote on the issue, they give pro-gun politicians money, they make phone calls,” Williams said. “The majority of people are with us on these issues, but there have been no consequences on it, because those who are on our side on this do not mobilize on the issue.”</p>\n<p>Greenwald said his hope for the film is that, over time, people will understand gun violence as a public health crisis driven by profit and greed and that they will take action.</p>\n<p>“[The film] is not about the second amendment; you may have noticed we never mentioned it in the film,” Greenwald said. “Give people a different way to talk about something, and from that it becomes action, and from that it becomes change, and from that we have great elected officials that carry the call and make it happen.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We are the only country in the world really who has this kind of senseless kind of gun violence; you don’t see this in other countries.” – Helene Schneider</p></blockquote>\n<p>Williams said it was difficult, as a parent, to watch the individuals in the film speak about the loss of their children.</p>\n<p>“To have them be willing to retraumatize themselves in the interest of having other people fall victim to guns … I think we should give Bob, and I think all the parents in the film, some thanks, because it takes a lot of courage and love to do that,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Although Weiss is driven by a desire to prevent others from losing their loved ones, like many other people affected by gun violence, his main motivation is to honor his daughter’s life.</p>\n<p>“She gave her life up for this movement. She didn’t know it at the time, but she gave up her life for this,” Weiss said. “I honor her by proceeding to try to keep the message out there and try to make some progress.”</p>\n<p>Weiss said it gets easier over time to share his story, but there are still days when the pain is too great.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There might be a week or two when I just can’t deal with it, I can’t think about it. I have meetings or engagements that I cancel because I can’t do it,” Weiss said. “But, in general, it gets easier, and it is my life now. It’s my career now, and every time I do something, I feel like I honor my daughter’s life.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69743\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/activists-address-gun-violence-as-profit-driven-crisis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69743\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/activists-address-gun-violence-as-profit-driven-crisis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/activists-address-gun-violence-as-profit-driven-crisis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/activists-address-gun-violence-as-profit-driven-crisis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/activists-address-gun-violence-as-profit-driven-crisis/","id":3895,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3894,3893,3892],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Capps’s H.O.P.E.

Segev completed the surgery in early March, transplanting a liver and kidney from a deceased HIV-positive donor to two HIV-positive recipients. Although the procedure posed the risk of transplanting a different HIV strain, the surgery was successful for both patients.</p>\n<p>President Barack Obama signed the H.O.P.E. Act into law in November 2013, allowing the use of organs from HIV-positive donors for transplantations and laboratory studies. The initial ban was enacted in the 1980s as a solution to a climate of fear surrounding HIV/A.I.D.S., research has since found HIV-positive donations to be safe for transplant.</p>\n<p>CJ Young, representative from Lois Capps’s office, said Capps is “extremely excited” about the successful surgeries and that research resulting from the H.O.P.E. Act has removed the stigmas surrounding HIV-positive donors.</p>\n<p>“Eliminating the stigma around HIV is critically important; that stigma can be a barrier to gaining access to treatment,” Young said. LGBTQ communities were “drastically impacted” by the stigmatization of HIV donors, Young said, and former school nurse Capps used the legislation to help amend the problem.</p>\n<p>During a press conference on Wednesday, Dr. Christine Durand of Johns Hopkins said both transplant patients, who wished to have their identities kept private, are doing “extremely well.” The kidney patient has returned home, and the liver patient is expected to be discharged in a few days.</p>\n<p>“The patient would have remained on the waitlist for years,” said Dr. Durand, describing donor conditions prior to the H.O.P.E. Act.</p>\n<p>The use of HIV-positive organ donors can potentially add 300 to 500 donors to the current waitlists, serving nearly 1,000 recipients, said Dr. Segev. The success of the surgery combined with the legislation in the H.O.P.E. Act promises future life-saving transplants for HIV-positive patients and those with end-stage organ diseases.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Weidong Henry Han, 57; his wife, Huijie Yu, 29, who was known as Jennie; and their daughter, Emily Han, 5, were found dead in their house on the 4600 block of Greenhill Way on Wednesday evening by sheriff’s deputies who were responding to a call to check their welfare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sheriff’s Office says it appears the family was targeted and that the “horrific” murder was not a random attack. The residence on Greenhill Way is less than five miles from UC Santa Barbara’s campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sheriff’s detectives are actively investigating this case and are working around the clock to determine who is responsible,” the Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Han owned the Santa Barbara Herb Clinic on State Street in Santa Barbara, which he founded in 1991, according to the clinic’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website says Han graduated from the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine in 1982 and has been practicing medicine since 1989. Han co-authored multiple books and had a contract with publisher Random House for a book on the integration of Chinese and Western medicine, according to the website.</span></p>\n<p><span

The foster homes will submit an online application process, and successful applicants will receive all materials needed to properly host their vacationing friend, donated by Lemos Pet Supply.</p>\n<p>The program began in December 2015, with a pilot program called “Santa’s Slumber Party.” Its goal was to find foster homes that could host dogs for two to three days, giving dogs a family for the holidays and time away from the kennel.</p>\n<p>“We had so much fun in December with our ‘Santa’s Slumber Party,’ and so many people have been asking when we are going to do this again,” Jeanne Saadi, community outreach coordinator for SBCAS, said. “We felt that spring break would be the perfect time to give our dogs another vacation from the shelter.”</p>\n<p>According to Saadi, although SBCAS tries to do this type of program two to three times a year, they are always looking for permanent homes for the dogs.</p>\n<p>“[We] are always actively seeking longer term foster homes, especially for dogs that need extra medical treatment, have been at the shelter for a long time or have some training opportunities that could be better addressed in a home,” Saadi said. “But we thought [the program] would be a good way to get people excited about doing that and maybe even foster some adoptions out of it.”</p>\n<p>While in the care of a host family, the dogs are given the opportunity to take part in different activities, such as going on hikes, going to dog friendly restaurants or spending quality time with someone in a home environment. These types of activities give the shelter staff and volunteers valuable information and insight about how each dog acts in a home environment.</p>\n<p>“The dogs get a change of scenery and a lot of personal attention, but they come back with more details and this allows us to set up the dogs for a more successful adoption,” Saadi said.</p>\n<p>After the initial program in December, two dogs were adopted by their foster families, and a third dog was adopted by a family because of new information the previous foster family had provided.</p>\n<p>Saadi said the process of becoming a foster parent for a dog begins with applying, followed by the shelter staff matching the parent “with a dog that will best fit their house.”</p>\n<p>“If they have another dog, we want them to bring their dog to see which one of our dogs gets along with best because we do not want it to be stressful for anybody,” Saaid said. “If they have a smaller home, then we encourage them to take a smaller dog, so we just try to match them with whoever is going to get along best.”</p>\n<p>Those interested in hosting a dog should contact Jeanne Saadi at the Santa Barbara Shelter at 805-681-4332 to host a dog seeking a vacation home.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-68844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Professional photographer and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Sebastião Salgado and author Pico Iyer spoke Wednesday evening at the Arlington Theatre about Genesis (2013), Salgado’s most recent photographic project, along with a discussion on environmental issues.</p>\n<p>Salgado’s photographic endeavors have taken him to over 100 countries and are documented in books such as Other Americas (1986), Migrations and Portraits (2000) and Africa (2007). At Wednesday’s event, Salgado presented photographs from Genesis that depicted vast landscapes, exotic animals and indigenous communities in the Galápagos Islands, Amazon jungle and West Papua, among other locations. Images for the Genesis project were captured over a period of eight years.</p>\n<p>Ph.D. candidate in computer science Arlei Lopes Da Silva said Salgado’s commentary on his travels complimented his photographs to communicate his message of environmental conservation.</p>\n<p>“I think, like he said, there is a social aspect and a political aspect to his work; he has a lot of ideology in him … he is not only taking photographs,” Silva said. “He has this political commentary that comes with the pictures, which I think is particularly interesting.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said during Genesis’ creation, he learned mutual respect should exist not only between humans, but also between all things on earth.</p>\n<p>“Each species is truly rational,” Salgado said. “Through this project, I started to respect other species: animal, vegetable, mineral.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said he started the Genesis project at the Galápagos Islands because of its wildlife.</p>\n<p>“I started Genesis in Galápagos because I had a wish to discover the animals,” Salgado said. “The evolution is so incredible.”</p>\n<p>Third-year zoology major Erin Morgan said she admires Salgado’s regard for nature and his awareness of the challenges facing the environment.</p>\n<p>“One thing that really got my attention was that Salgado talked about going to ‘meet the trees,’ which I thought shows that extra level of respect and recognition for nature and makes you realize that you are part of something that’s so much bigger than just being human,” Morgan said.</p>\n<p>Salgado said his work explores the ideas of shared responsibility in caring for the planet.</p>\n<p>“We have the tools to protect the planet … we are responsible for everything in our society,” Salgado said. “We destroy our forests, we destroy everything, we don’t care about our planet; we need to respect every life.”</p>\n<p>Ph.D. candidate in computer science Sourav Medya said Salgado’s willingness to express his personal opinions is commendable and visible in his work.</p>\n<p>“He cares a lot about the planet, so whatever he shows in his photography is something intuitive based on this idea,” Medya said.</p>\n<p>Salgado described his ability to visit the globe’s most isolated locations as his “biggest gift” because he “became” the nature he experienced.</p>\n<p>“In this moment, I became a stone, I became the snow, I became the mountain … I was the planet,” Salgado said. “I made a lot of trips, but the biggest was inside myself.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Yana Williams said she appreciated Salgado’s idea that people must accept responsibility for the unintended consequences their actions have on the planet.</p>\n<p>“I was really inspired when Salgado talked about how people like to point fingers when they’re talking about environmental issues,” Williams said. “We’re all involved in these issues … they affect us, just like they affect the people living in the places that are being torn down. We should all take an active part in this effort.”</p>\n<p>Salgado concluded his talk by saying photography should be used to call attention to issues facing society.</p>\n<p>“Photograph is a mirror of our society, a tool, a language,” Salgado said. “We have the tools to take care of the planet for the future, but to do this, we have to take care of the past.”</p><div

residents-only parking restriction in Isla Vista for Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>City Council’s passing of the resolution followed a recommendation from the City’s staff. The resolution, titled “A Resolution of the City Council of the City of Goleta, California Establishing Temporary Resident Only On-Street Parking Restrictions Related to the 2016 Isla Vista Deltopia Event,” will be in place from 9 a.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Although Deltopia is expected to occur the weekend of April 2, City staff requested authorization to implement the parking restrictions for the weekends of April 2 and April 9 to allow for flexibility should the date change.</p>\n<p>Last Deltopia, Goleta implemented a temporary ban on street parking on certain high-traffic blocks of I.V. Based on a survey of residents and testimonies of law enforcement and City personnel following the weekend, City staff concluded temporary parking restrictions are effective and meet residents’ needs.</p>\n<p>Deputy City Clerk Liana Campos presented the City staff’s report recommending City Council pass the resolution.</p>\n<p>The report calls on UCSB to encourage students to park on campus while the restrictions are in place.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is expected to take the same measures for this spring’s event. To help dissuade partygoers from parking in the Goleta neighborhoods closest to Isla Vista during the Deltopia event,” the staff report said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68720\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68720\" data-attachment-id=\"68720\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/goleta-city-council-to-restrict-parking-during-deltopia-weekend/deltopia-parking-city-council_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Deltopia Parking City Council\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68720\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to the report, over the past two years, the date for Deltopia has the potential to change very quickly with the use of social media.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia is not to be confused with a series of sanctioned UCSB events generally known as “Spring Warm Up” that occur in the same time period,” the report said. “Potentially upwards of 25,000 people could pass through Goleta for this Isla Vista event.”</p>\n<p>The parking restriction area would have the boundaries of Cannon Green Drive to the west, Hollister Avenue to the north, Storke Road to the east and Whittier Drive to the south — making up the Goleta neighborhoods known as University 1 and University 2.</p>\n<p>“Parking permits would be required to be taped to the inside of the vehicle’s driver’s side window during the restricted hours,” the report said. “Vehicles found parked on any of the streets in the University 1-2 neighborhoods during the restricted times, not displaying the appropriate parking permit, would be subject to ticketing and/or towing.”</p>\n<p>The recommendation to the City passed unanimously and I.V. residencies will be mailed two parking permits each.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We really try to make it so that everybody can hear and participate.”</p>\n<p>Vernon McCaslin, who owns a local business and works with veterans, was concerned about the impact on handicapped parking.</p>\n<p>“The plan needs to be thought out better,” McCaslin said. “[City Council hasn’t] offered a viable solution for what they are going to do with businesses, cars and people that go to those businesses.”</p>\n<p>Mike Ober, a UCSB alumnus and an architect, said a bicycle lane would be more valuable than parking spaces.</p>\n<p>“The primary purpose of streets is to facilitate the movement of people,” Ober said. “Free parking is a bonus. All [that space] is just free parking that anyone has a right to.”</p>\n<p>Ober said that because more people are commuting via bike, there will be more parking spaces available.</p>\n<p>“Every day that I ride a bike instead of drive, there’s going to be one more parking space — one more precious, beautiful, asphalt parking space — just waiting,” Ober said. “I think once the emotions settle, people will realize making biking more accessible and safe will result in additional parking.”</p>\n<p>Joey Juhasz-Lukomski, operations manager for the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition, said it is “so valuable” to have a complete and connected bike pathway.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s going to encourage more people to ride their bikes,” Juhasz-Lukomski said. “That’s going to be more people biking downtown, which could actually free up more parking spaces because there will be less people driving downtown.”</p>\n<p>Omar Uribe, Santa Barbara City College student, said he is looking forward to safer bike travel after the Master Plan is implemented.</p>\n<p>“As a bicyclist, I know that [Micheltorena] has no bike lanes,” Uribe said. “I’ve been close to getting hit a couple times, and I’ve seen people get hit on that street.”</p>\n<p>Ober said bicycle safety should be a primary concern for the Council when considering the Master Plan.</p>\n<p>“A lot of motorists get passionate about parking or keeping streets for cars, but for them, it’s a convenience issue,” Ober said. “For cyclists, it’s a safety issue. It’s life and death.”</p>\n<p>Ober said his time spent on UCSB’s campus helped him discover the efficiency of biking.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is a lovely place to discover cycling as a practical way of getting around,” Ober said. “I lived on 6800 block of DP [Del Playa Drive]. I also lived on Phelps [Road] which is out by Costco. It taught me that it is way faster to ride a bike to get to class.”</p>\n<p>Tiffany Wu, second-year economics and accounting major chair of the A.S. Bicycle Committee, said she is pleased with the Council’s decision.</p>\n<p>“I’m really glad they passed it because it’s more sustainable and a lot safer for students because we are part of the community as well,” Wu said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68602\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68602\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/","id":3859,"author":{"id":155,"name":"Zareena Zaidi"},"related":[3858,3857,3856],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Das Williams Introduces Bill To Establish Uniform AP Credit Transfer Among Community Colleges","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?resize=600%2C446&ssl=1","description":"Assemblymember Das Williams recently introduced Assembly Bill 1985, which would establish a uniform policy for Advance Placement (AP) credit transfer from high schools to all California Community Coll...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68411\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68411\" data-attachment-id=\"68411\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/das-williams-introduces-bill-to-establish-uniform-ap-credit-transfer-among-community-colleges/sbcc-campus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?fit=600%2C446&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,446\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBCC Campus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;For Das Williams Article 2-18&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?fit=600%2C446&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68411\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?resize=550%2C409\" alt=\"SBCC Campus.

The goal of the proposal is to make transitioning to a four-year university more feasible for students. The bill would allow for the application of AP credit to college units at community colleges throughout California.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the bill will save low-income students time and money by transferring college credits from AP exams to community college.</p>\n<p>“AB 1985 not only builds a uniform policy to improve students’ time to degree and transfer, ultimately saving tuition costs for students and their families, but it will also prevent discrepancies on AP scores between CCCs,” Williams said in a news release.</p>\n<p>According to Lourdes Jimenez, Williams’ chief of staff, there are currently 24 community colleges that require an AP score of 4 for college credit, six community colleges that require a score of 5 and 10 community colleges that have no policies, out of the 113 California Community Colleges.</p>\n<p>“This inconsistency creates confusion and is an unnecessary barrier to students entering the community colleges in our state who have earned college credit,” Jimenez said. “Assemblymember William believes it’s important to have uniform policies that are clear to students.”</p>\n<p>Jimenez said the office has communicated with administration and officials from the UC, California State University and College Board to maintain the students’ interest when implementing the bill.</p>\n<p>“We have focused on making sure this bill does not affect the work that has already been achieved by the college segments dealing with transferability to make sure a student’s transition in and out of college happens sooner,” Jimenez said.</p>\n<p>Luz Reyes-Martin, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) public information officer, said she supports the bill because there is currently no standardized policy for awarding AP credits across all community colleges.</p>\n<p>“I think what is very positive about the assemblyman’s proposed bill is that it would create a uniform policy across the 113 California Community Colleges,” Reyes-Martin said. “It’s part of our mission to facilitate and support students who want to transfer on to a UC or another four-year university.”</p>\n<p>According to Reyes-Martin, SBCC currently has its own comprehensive AP credit transfer system in which students are awarded general education units for passing an exam with a score of 3 or higher.</p>\n<p>“We have a very good relationship with the assemblymember and his office, so we are definitely looking forward to talking with them and … helping give them any advice or any best practices to offer with that policy,” Reyes-Martin said. “We’ll definitely be looking at the bill and checking it to see how it will affect our existing system.”</p>\n<p>According to Spencer Barr, Santa Barbara High School college and career counselor, close to 50 percent of Santa Barbara High School’s senior class enroll at SBCC for community college.</p>\n<p>“Out of those students, we don’t have a ton of them that are taking multiple AP classes,” Barr said. “It’s usually a couple of classes, maybe as many as four classes that students are trying to get credits for.”</p>\n<p>Barr said although SBCC offers students in Santa Barbara two years of free tuition, he supports the plan to alleviate the financial challenges of all students attending community college.</p>\n<p>“[SBCC] has just introduced a new plan where any local high school student in Santa Barbara, assuming you graduated from a local high school, can go to SBCC completely free for two full years,” Barr said. “That financial hardship is not as much of a financial hardship anymore because everything is paid for.”</p>\n<p>Barr said he supports a uniform AP credit system across all community colleges because it would decrease the time required for students to transfer into a four-year university.</p>\n<p>“It would be great if there is a standardized platform for the California Community Colleges in terms of accepting credits,” Barr said. “That would speed up the transfer process for any students who are looking to go that road with two years at community college and transferring to a four-year university.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

the second annual Polar Plunge fundraiser at Leadbetter Beach on Sunday.</p>\n<p>With the catch phrase “Freezin’ for a Reason,” the nonprofit encourages participants to come swim in the Pacific Ocean to help fund the organization. Last year, the event raised more than $30,000 for the cause. Everyone is invited to take the plunge in costume or simply make a donation. A minimum donation of $50 is asked of participants taking the plunge, with a free T-shirt and breakfast courtesy of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department included.</p>\n<p>Gina Carbajal, regional director for the Special Olympics of SB, said the fundraiser provided crucial funding for the organization.</p>\n<p>“The polar plunge, and this is our second annual one here in Santa Barbara, is really a way for individuals and groups to actually come together and raise money for Special Olympics,” Carbajal said. “All the money that we raise stays here in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>According to Carbajal, the event is very flexible and casual.</p>\n<p>“Individuals get the time to just go and plunge in the water here at Leadbetter Beach, either individually or as groups,” Carbajal said. “You just come out in your shorts, bathing suit — some people come out in costumes.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal said there are a different shirts for those who swim and for those who are “too chicken.”</p>\n<p>“The pledgers get a shirt. It’s a full-on shirt that actually has the Polar Plunge and Special Olympics logo on it,” Carbajal said. “It says ‘I took the plunge’ and individuals that don’t want to plunge — are too chicken to plunge — get a shirt that says ‘I was too chicken to plunge.’”</p>\n<p>Carbajal said people should donate because the money raised will stay local, going directly to the Special Olympics chapter for Santa Barbara youth.</p>\n<p>“The moneys that are raised are used for individuals with intellectual disabilities, so individuals that have, for example, Down syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy and other types of intellectual disabilities,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Another sponsor of the event is the Hutton Parker Foundation, which funds nonprofit organizations in Santa Barbara County. Chief Operating Officer Pamela Lewis said the foundation has been a long-time supporter of Special Olympics.</p>\n<p>“Benefiting Special Olympics is a very unique and fulfilling event that gives a lot of visibility to the organization and that just helps them to further promote themselves and their programs,” Lewis said. “It’s for a great cause.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
