Deputies located the woman in question at 6503 Madrid Road in Isla Vista, where she told officers more details about her situation.<br>\n“The woman stated she was on a life-changing mission and that her great grandmother just passed away today,” Plastino said. “She also said her life mission is to bring world peace and end violence against humanity.”<br>\nPlastino said the woman alternated between sobbing and smiling “all within seconds,” before standing up in an attempt to remove her clothes.<br>\n“The woman stood up, removed her top and began to remove her sweatpants. Deputies were able to prevent her from pulling down her sweatpants,” Plastino said. “Deputies then handcuffed the woman and asked her friend to put the shirt back on the woman. The friend assisted and helped cover the woman up.”<br>\nAccording to Plastino, the woman was later transferred to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for a complete medical evaluation.<br>\nOn Friday evening, deputies received a call reporting a robbery at an apartment on El Colegio Road. The victim who made the call said he was approached by two adult males while taking out his trash, according to Plastino, who said the victim described the suspects as “two black ‘gangster-looking’ males.”<br>\n“One of the males threw him down and started punching him in the face,” Plastino said, while adding that the victim gave the suspect his full prescription of Xanax, which the victim had inside his wallet in his pocket.<br>\nAccording to Plastino, the property manager of the victim’s apartment complex verified the story as a witness to the incident. The investigation is ongoing.<br>\nOn Saturday night, a UCSB student injured himself while attempting to escape from IVFP deputies while intoxicated, Plastino said.<br>\n“[The subject] was extremely drunk and attempted to run upon contact by Foot Patrol,” Plastino said. “He was chased and caught by two deputies, at which time he sustained an abrasion above the eye.”<br>\nPlastino said medics were called to treat the man’s injuries and shortly after receiving treatment, he was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail for assaulting one of the medical personnel.<br>\nIsla Vista also saw a series of laptop robberies this weekend, according to Plastino. Six laptops were stolen over the weekend — two on Saturday and four on Sunday. On Saturday night, two different laptops were stolen from separate houses on Del Playa Drive, with one stolen through an unlocked bedroom door during a house party while the other was taken from a female victim’s room while she slept. On Sunday, two laptops were taken from a house on Trigo Road from an unlocked backdoor and another two laptops were taken from a residence on Cervantes Road through an unlocked door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, May 14, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55302\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55302\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/","id":3799,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3798,3797,3796],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up (5-2 to 5-5 2014)","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to the discovery of a dead female body on the beach as well as an occurrence of shoplifting, among other minor incidents.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to the discovery of a dead female body on the beach as well as an occurrence of shoplifting, among other minor incidents.</p>\n<p>According IVFP Station Lieutenant Robert Plastino, deputies responded following a call by a cyclist at approximately 7:00 a.m. on Sunday to report a female body lying on the beach. Police and fire officials determined that the female was deceased and later identified the female as second-year junior and double major in language, culture and society and philosophy Sierra Markee-Winkler.</p>\n<p>Plastino said police were able to determine the body as Markee-Winkler due to help from her roommate and forensic evidence.</p>\n<p>“During an area canvas, IVFP was approached by a female subject, who observed us carrying the decedent from the beach and was concerned that it may have been her missing roommate,” Plastino said. “Using forensics and a lead provided by [Winkler’s] roommate, the decedent’s identity was verified.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said investigation into the circumstances surrounding Markee-Winkler’s death are ongoing and that although a cause of death has not yet been determined, Markee-Winkler was missing the night before.</p>\n<p>“Preliminary investigation revealed that Markee-Winkler was involved in an argument with one of her roommates at her residence,” Plastino said. “Markee-Winkler, who had been drinking and was upset, left the residence and headed toward the 6800 block of Del Playa.”</p>\n<p>However, Plastino said that while Markee-Winkler was reported to be emotional when she left the scene, there was no sign of foul play and no one had followed her.</p>\n<p>“[The] Sheriff’s, Coroner’s and forensic team are working to determine the cause of death,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Until a full autopsy is completed, Plastino said, there are several possible causes of death, including a fall from the cliff. But Plastino said it is likely Markee-Winkler died from other causes due to her experience living in I.V. and the fact that her phone and sandals were found neatly placed behind the residence located at 6865 Del Playa.</p>\n<p>“Initially, we were thinking she accidentally fell off, but then we realized this is not the typical fall from the cliff. Unlike other victims, who are usually out-of-towners or [freshmen], she was a junior and knew the area well,” Plastino said. “But there is nothing to indicate that she threw herself off on purpose.”</p>\n<p>Plastino also said it was possible Markee-Winkler had gone down to the beach and fallen asleep on the sand when the waves were at low tide and was later unable to escape the high tide currents.</p>\n<p>“Remember, it is pitch black down there at night and the water is freezing. In that water, she wouldn’t have lasted 15 minutes,” Plastino said. “We have a lot of questions that still need to be answered.”</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, deputies also responded to a call on Saturday afternoon at approximately 1:05 p.m. from the Movement Ink store on 6556 Pardall Road. The store’s owner had detained an individual suspected of shoplifting.</p>\n<p>“The owner of the store was standing inside the shop detaining [the suspect]. The shop owner signed a citizen’s arrest form and stated [the suspect] walked out of the store with a hat worth $40 concealed under his shirt,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>The owner confronted the suspect outside, Plastino said, which is when the suspect revealed the hat. After performing a background check on the suspect, officers discovered he had committed other acts of theft in the past.</p>\n<p>“[The suspect] admitted to law enforcement that he hid the hat under his shirt,” Plastino said. “A record check showed [the suspect] had been arrested less than a month prior for shoplifting at 7-Eleven and was a person of interest in a residential burglary in 2013.”</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested and eventually released with a citation for theft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Wednesday, May 7, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55193\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55193\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/","id":3793,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3792,3791,3790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The weekend began with a report of assault that took place on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies responded to an assault case on 6671 Del Playa that involved a student from San Diego State University and an unidentified victim. Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lt. Robert Plastino said in-field witnesses assisted officers with the investigation.</p>\n<p>“A 21-year-old SDSU student sucker-punched the victim from behind, knocking him unconscious, causing lacerations requiring sutures and breaking a front tooth,” Plastino said. “[There was] no motivation to punch the victim. It was for no reason — out of the blue.”</p>\n<p>The suspect was charged with assault and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail. That same night, officers arrested an out-of-town visitor for indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs at the residence of 6563 Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>“A 20-year-old Claremont resident was observed by multiple reporting parties and incoming deputies to be actively exposing his genitals for gratification purposes,” Plastino said. “He was arrested and also found to be in possession of cocaine.”</p>\n<p>During the daytime on Saturday, deputies arrested Isla Vista local Jamal Blue for selling marijuana on the 6600 block of Trigo Road. According to Plastino, deputies watched Blue conduct a hand-to-hand transaction with a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>“Investigation found that Jamal had provided the student with marijuana. He was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, a stolen iPhone was recovered at Freebirds last Wednesday. He said the victim texted the suspect who was in possession of the phone.</p>\n<p>“The suspect, [a] Freebirds employee, confirmed the serial number and said he had purchased it from a UCSB student,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>When the victim demanded the phone back, Plastino said the employee requested a $180 reimbursement from the victim. According to Plastino, the suspect was eventually discovered to be speaking falsely about the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the phone.</p>\n<p>“The suspect was lying. He had found the phone and was trying to force the victim to pay him in order to get it back,” Plastino</p>\n<p>Plastino said IVFP took measures to detain the suspect, who was found not only to be in possession of the iPhone but also of a meth pipe. With this finding, the suspect was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, April 30, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55089\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55089\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/","id":3798,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3797,3796,3795],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Spring Break Crime Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last week, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of incidents including several assaults, one of which involved assault by use of machete, and alcohol-related crimes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last week, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of incidents including several assaults, one of which involved assault by use of machete, and alcohol-related crimes.</p>\n<p>The incidents occurred at intervals of about one-to-two days and ranged from assaults that resulted in deeper flesh wounds to a near-miss injury. Crimes occurring later in the week included an arrest for unlicensed marijuana possession and the usual distribution of citations for minors in possession of alcohol.</p>\n<p>According to Sergeant Rob Plastino, officers received a call early morning last Monday on March 24 from an individual reporting that a masked man went into his home and assaulted him with a machete. The suspect, Plastino said, was wearing a mask, hoodie and all black clothing.</p>\n<p>“The victim said he was in his residence and while there, someone entered his house,” Plastino said. “The victim received a wound that was two inches deep and two inches long on his arm. It seems that he raised his arms to defend himself from the assailant’s attack.”</p>\n<p>The victim then fled to I.V. Food Coop where he contacted the police. Plastino said the victim was transported to the hospital shortly after, and now the incident is facing investigation.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday night, deputies responded to a call from a victim that stated his roommate punched him several times in the head. According to Plastino, deputies who arrived at the victim’s residence observed that he had “a large welt on the backside of his head,” although the man refused medical attention.</p>\n<p>“The suspect states that the victim was being disrespectful because he was having sex with his [the suspect’s] girlfriend in front of him,” Plastino said. “Because the victim wanted to press charges, the suspect was arrested and booked into jail.”</p>\n<p>Also on Wednesday night, deputies responded to a call that there was a large in-progress fight outside 6776 Del Playa Drive. When officers arrived, most of the crowd scattered except for one individual, whom deputies approached.</p>\n<p>“The suspect was found to be drunk in public and while being arrested, he started a fight with deputies and kicked a police sergeant several times,” Plastino said. “He was booked with multiple charges, including public intoxication and assault on a police officer.”</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies on patrol near Del Playa and Camino Majorca contacted four people sitting inside a car, smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol. According to Plastino, when an officer approached the vehicle and the driver rolled down the window, marijuana smoke emanated from the car.</p>\n<p>“The suspect had no marijuana license and the deputies determined that the passengers consisted of a 19-year-old male driver, a 23-year-old male sitting in the passenger seat and two 15-year-old females sitting in the back seat,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino stated that the 23-year old male was cited for multiple charges, including providing alcohol to minors. The 19-year-old male was cited with minor in possession of alcohol as well as other charges.</p>\n<p>“The two juvenile girls initially lied about their identity when contacted. Being fifteen, they had no driver licenses, but officers eventually discovered who they were … they are being charged with minor in possession and false representation.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, a victim called 9-11 reporting that a 40-year-old man threw a rock at him, but missed.</p>\n<p>“When officers arrived at the scene, the suspect threw the rock behind a building where it could not be located,” Plastino said. “However, when officers made contact with the suspect, they discovered he was in possession of a stolen bike and a cell phone that was not his. He was arrested for assault and the possession of stolen property.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Wednesday, April 2, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54554\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54554\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/","id":3796,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3795,3794,3793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Arrested Over Stabbing, Unlawful Assembly","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Summers-Dickinson-Kuriyan1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Summers-Dickinson-Kuriyan1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last night, a stabbing occurred on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive at approximately 10:45 p.m., after which a large crowd surrounded the police officers who were investigating the scene and grew to ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/yfyPPOqAIzU\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE 6/25:</strong> UCSB student Tomas Deleveau was arrested March 9, 2014 for </em>alleged<em> battery of a police officer but was not convicted. <em>A decision not to file an accusatory pleading of Deleveau was made by the Santa Barbara County District on April 8, 2014.

The perpetrator was Lompoc resident 18-year-old Kuriyan Summers-Dickinson, and the incident occurred after a fight broke out at the residence. The victim is currently in a stable condition at a local hospital, and Summers-Dickinson was arrested and charged with attempted murder, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>Following the stabbing, a large crowd accumulated around the deputies who were attending to the incident, and Isla Vista resident Otis Dezjuan Washington was found jumping on top of vehicles and arrested for “vehicle tampering and resisting arrest.” As police arrested Washington, more people crowded around the deputies and “began chanting and throwing bottles,” according to the press release, eventually resulting in an unlawful assembly with an estimated one thousand people. Law enforcement pushed back the crowd, using pepper spray and batons on those who refused to leave, resulting in the arrest of UCSB student Tomas Delaveau for battery on a peace officer.</p>\n<p>Public Information Specialist for the SB County Sheriff’s Office Kelly Hoover maintained that the crowd would not be considered a riot, but that it risked becoming one.</p>\n<p>“It was an unlawful assembly which could have turned into a riot,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Hoover said the crowd assembled as a result of being intrigued by Washington’s arrrest, and began shouting things like “Let him go,” and “Fuck the police.”</p>\n<p>“I believe they just saw that someone was being arrested, and they gathered around the deputies who were making the arrested and the handcuffed student,” Hoover said. “I think when it started out it was a couple hundred people, and then as they saw there was something happening more and more people gathered.”</p>\n<p>Hoover expressed frustration with the behavior of the crowd, saying the crowd restricted the law enforcement’s ability to keep the area safe.</p>\n<p>“It’s disappointing that when law enforcement is out there trying to keep people safe, to have individuals who are making that effort more difficult and being disrespectful to our law enforcement,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>A fourth-year resident of the 6600 block of Del Playa who requested to remain anonymous said she was disappointed with the crowd’s response to the police, given their role in keeping the community safe.</p>\n<p>“It is completely disrespectful and shameful for the crowd to have yelled such insults to our police officers, the ones who are working to control crimes such as the horrific rape that occurred this month. I’d like to feel safe in my community,” she said.</p>\n<p>Photos Courtesy of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>This story appeared as an online exclusive on Sunday, March 9, 2014.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/","id":3789,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3788,3787,3786],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to various incidents including a drug bust, a battery case on Del Playa Drive and a series of residential burglaries.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to various incidents including a drug bust, a battery case on Del Playa Drive and a series of residential burglaries.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Sergeant Mark Signa, a college-aged male subject was arrested on Friday night for the possession of anti-anxiety medications without a prescription. Upon searching the vehicle, officers located six Xanax pills and the suspect was booked into jail for possession of Xanax without a prescription, according to Signa, who said the search was made following a traffic stop.</p>\n<p>“Deputies made a traffic stop for a subject whom failed to signal when turning on Cordoba,” Signa said. “It was discovered that the suspect was on probation for drug sales. Per the terms of his probation, his vehicle was searched.”</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officials also responded to a call for an injured adult male at a house party on the 6700 block of Del Playa on Friday night. When they arrived to the residence, officers found the injured suspect, who is 19-20 years old, at the base of a staircase as well as a victim nearby, according to Signa. He also said the victim was pointing at the injured suspect and saying the suspect was “kicking subjects as they attempted to walk up the stairs.”</p>\n<p>“The suspect was arrested for battery and booked into jail,” Signa said. “It is unknown whether the suspect was a student or not.”</p>\n<p>In addition, deputies responded to a call from the 6700 block of Del Playa reporting a residential burglary that had occurred sometime between the previous night and early Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>“An unknown suspect entered the victim’s residence from an unlocked front door,” Signa said. “Two laptops — both MacBook Pros — were taken and the investigation is continuing.”</p>\n<p>A second burglary was also reported early Sunday morning from the apartment complexes at 781 Embarcadero Del Norte, with the incident involving the theft of three Apple Macbook Pro laptop computers from an apartment living room at 5 a.m.</p>\n<p>“One of the [female] victims heard someone moving around in the apartment and called 9-1-1,” Signa said. “Neighbors saw a suspect loitering around the apartment building before the theft [and] described [him] as a large athletic, black male adult about 6’2, wearing a black hoodie.

According to IVFP Sergeant Mark Signa, deputies observed a girl sitting on a curb near the Isla Vista 7-11 crying and saying she had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“She was very upset and — interviewed by IVPF — she stated she had been sexually assaulted on Del Playa Drive after leaving a party,” Signa said. “The suspect is unknown. He was either a Middle Eastern or Asian male.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday morning, deputies responded to a trespassing report on 6500 Del Playa Drive at 11 a.m. A female resident reported that at around 1:30 am, an unknown male had entered her home through a bathroom window. She and her boyfriend found the suspect, a college-aged Hispanic male, in their bathroom and then escorted him outside. After seeing the UCSB emergency alert regarding a sexual assault, the couple contacted officials and reported the incident.</p>\n<p>Also on Saturday night, Signa said deputies stopped a Del Playa resident from falsely imprisoning some of his party guests, after he attempted to flee authorities and prevented them from entering his house.</p>\n<p>“On Saturday night, on the 6700 block of Del Playa after midnight, several males were making lewd comments from their residence to passersby [mainly females], and in violation of noise ordinance,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa states that when deputies attempted to make contact with the males, they ran inside the house and refused to answer the door.</p>\n<p>“After 30 minutes of attempting to convince residents to open the door, deputies observed a female attempting to leave but was being physically restrained. The door was forced open. Approximately 70 people were inside,” Signa said. “Two people were contacted inside that were trying to leave, but were not allowed to.”</p>\n<p>One resident was given a citation for obstruction of justice and a misdemeanor charge of false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Between 11 p.m. on Saturday and 4 a.m. on Sunday, another sexual assault occurred at an unknown location. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office reported that a 19-year-old female UCSB student was beaten and raped by three suspects described only as “Asian males.”</p>\n<p>According to Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, before the incident, the victim was last seen walking alone between midnight and 12:30 a.m. near Embarcadero Del Mar and Segovia Road.

After the incident, the student returned to her home in I.V., her roommate contacted police and she was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of her injuries and an examination, according to a press release. The other victim was a female of undisclosed age who was sexually assaulted behind a vehicle on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The assault occurred near a party held on the same block in the early hours of Saturday morning. The assailant was described as a 5’6” male of “thin build” with dark hair and dark eyes who fled west — away from campus — after the assault, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Office Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, the recent incident of sexual assault in which one victim was beaten, as well as raped, by a group of suspects is a particularly rare and severe case.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, reports of sexual assaults in Isla Vista are not uncommon; however, this is definitely an extreme case,” Hoover said in an email. “The incident underscores the importance of not walking alone, especially at night, and to do everything in your power not to put yourself in a situation where you could become a victim.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of Take Back the Night — a campus group that supports victims of sexual assault — Kelty Kauffman, who is a second-year feminist studies and English double major, said the university and local law enforcement should do more to combat sexual assault on campus and in I.V., such as more educational campaigns.</p>\n<p>“There is never enough. The fact that we don’t teach a thorough discussion around consent to our freshmen is a problem,” Kauffman said. “When freshmen have to take Gaucho FYI, there’s a very minor portion on consent and I think that should be elaborated on because a lot of people don’t actually know what the definition of consent is.”</p>\n<p>While Kauffman said there is work being done to improve how the UC deals with sexual assault cases, she said there is still need for a change in how law enforcement treats rape cases and how victims are generally treated by society.</p>\n<p>“Currently, we enforce a culture of violence,” Kauffman said. “I have heard personal accounts of the police in Isla Vista not taking rape allegations seriously here and being condescending or dismissive of survivors, and that continues to contribute to a culture that tell survivors not to come forward with their stories and allows rapists to go free.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, Sheriff’s Deputies and UCPD Officers are seeking information throughout the Isla Vista area as well as around campus to help identify and locate the suspects with the assistance of a Sheriff’s K9 Unit.</p>\n<p>If you have any information on the cases, the Sherriff’s Office asks to call 9-1-1 immediately or to leave an anonymous tip call at 805-681-4171.

IVFP Sherriff’s Lieutenant Robert Plastino said deputies encountered an individual stealing from a vehicle in an alleyway on Picasso Road on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>The suspect was identified as Sergio Torres, a resident from Ventura, who told officers he was visiting a friend. Lieutenant Plastino reported that Torres was found to be in possession of a mask, gloves, a flashlight and wire cutters.</p>\n<p>Shortly after officers requested additional sheriff units from Goleta, a man named Dennis Rizzo — who is a friend of Torres’s — was located and apprehended on the 700 block of Camino Del Sur. According to Plastino, Rizzo was found in possession of stolen property and attempted to hide some of his burglary tools upon being spotted by police. After examining the recovered stolen items, deputies determined that the two had targeted multiple areas with smash-and-grab auto burglary that night — including locations at 6512 Segovia, El Greco and Embarcadero Del Mar, as well as locations in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Plastino said the pair was right in the midst of their theft schemes when they were spotted by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“[They] were in the process of looking for more cars to break into when they got caught,” Plastino said. “Both were on probation out of Ventura County for theft charge and are facing several charges in SB County,”</p>\n<p>The following night, on Friday, IVFP officers responded to another auto-theft incident.</p>\n<p>“An unknown suspect took the victim’s vehicle registration, insurance card, and FM transmitter from her unsecured vehicle that was parked in front of 6522 El Greco Road,” Plastino said.Sh</p>\n<p>Although one fingerprint was found and submitted to the County Forensics Department, no description of the suspect is available.</p>\n<p>Later that evening, in the early hours of Saturday morning, at around 1 a.m., deputies responded to a victim who reported being assaulted after trying to break up a fight on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>“A student was walking westbound on 6500 block Sabado Tarde and saw four men fighting. He attempted to break up the fight and while he was doing so, an unknown person punched him from behind. He lost consciousness and broke his jaw,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>The victim was immediately transported to the emergency room for treatment and surgery, according to Plastino, but he was unable to provide a description of the suspect.</p>\n<p>Plastino commented that, although the victim had positive intentions, witnesses should always first call 911 for help.</p>\n<p>That same evening, deputies responded to another assault incident on the 6700 block of Del Playa, Plastino said.</p>\n<p>“Deputies contacted the victim, who sustained a head injury as a result of the fight,” Plastino said. “Separately, deputies arrested the suspect in the nearby area. The suspect was identified by the victim as one of the people that had kicked him in the head.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, the suspect was booked for battery with serious bodily injury.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/","id":3785,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3784,3783,3782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Recover Stolen Items, Search for Suspects","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of drug and alcohol-related offenses this weekend, as well as a strong-armed robbery and another incidence of theft.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of drug and alcohol-related offenses this weekend, as well as a strong-armed robbery and another incidence of theft.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officials arrested a team of burglars, investigated a strong-armed robbery that led to no arrests, arrested a group of minors for possession of alcohol and fleeing arrest and investigated and arrested an individual for possession of prescription strength cough syrup and hash. Officials also arrested two unrelated individuals for simultaneous incidents of shoplifting and battery, as reported by the owner of the 7-Eleven on Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Sheriff’s Lieutenant Robert Plastino, a strong-armed robbery occurred on El Greco Road at approximately 1:45 a.m. on Saturday. Plastino said the victim reports two males coming up to him on El Greco and hitting him repeatedly on the head.</p>\n<p>“He was knocked to the ground and when he asked what they wanted, they said ‘cash,’” Plastino said. “He gave them $40 from his wallet and the suspects fled toward UCSB.”</p>\n<p>The victim was not injured but was only able to give a limited description of his assailants, so police officers were unable to arrest anyone in connection with the incident. A UCSB emergency e-mail alert was sent to warn students of the incident and ask the public for further information.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at approximately 2:40 p.m. on Saturday, deputies intercepted and apprehended a suspected team of burglars, according to Plastino.</p>\n<p>“[California Highway Patrol] Officers observed a green GMC Envoy traveling northbound on Embarcadero Del Norte with one headlight out … and stopped the vehicle,” Plastino said. “IVFP deputies joined and contacted the people in the car. All were from Oxnard.”</p>\n<p>Upon checking their identities, officers discovered that two of the men had arrest warrants from Ventura County. The men were arrested and officers conducted a search on the car, which revealed several burglary tools including pry bars, cutting devices, flash lights, gloves and puncture tools. Officers also discovered a marijuana pipe, two methamphetamine pipes, a small supply of methamphetamine, three hypodermic syringes and Xanax.</p>\n<p>Plastino said officers recovered what appeared to be stolen goods, including eight cell phones and an Espana guitar in a black case that appeared to belong to an SBCC student.</p>\n<p>“All four men were arrested and charged with possession of burglary tools, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of hypodermic syringes, possession of prescripted meds without prescription [and] possession of stolen property,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, according to Plastino, deputies also arrested an intoxicated subject who was jumping on the rear trunk of a parked vehicle.</p>\n<p>“When I asked why he jumped on the vehicle, his response was, ‘Because I’m intoxicated and making bad choices,’” Plastino said. “The suspect had his older brother’s identification inside his wallet. When asked why he had his brother’s ID, the suspect responded, ‘to buy alcohol of course.’”</p>\n<p>Although Plastino said “the level of honesty was very rare,” the suspect was arrested for being drunk in public, minor in possession, causing damage to another’s vehicle and possession of someone else’s identification.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/","id":3787,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3786,3785,3784],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Officers Search for Suspects After DP Stabbing, Assault ","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UCSB Police Department officers are actively searching for two suspects in connection with a stabbing incident that occurred just after midnight Saturday morning on the 6500...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UCSB Police Department officers are actively searching for two suspects in connection with a stabbing incident that occurred just after midnight Saturday morning on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive, according to the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>Sherriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover said the incident began with a verbal altercation between a group of about four people and two males that escalated when one victim was stabbed in the back and another was hit in the head with a bottle.</p>\n<p>Officers responded to 6579 Del Playa at approximately 12:20 a.m. and were unable to locate any of the four original suspects — three males and one female — after searching the area extensively, Hoover said.

Steinhorn is being charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale, possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. Santa Barbara County police officials also arrested two Santa Barbara residents for possession of half an ounce of heroin, which holds an estimated street value of $1,500. One of the suspects, 29-year-old Donald Windsor, was charged with possession of a controlled substance, transportation of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia while 25-year-old Cassidy Morse was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p>Although Steinhorn was initially booked into Santa Barbara County with his bail set at $30,000, he was released on March 22 and is expected to appear in court again on April 25. Both Windsor and Morse are being held at Santa Barbara County jail, with Windor’s bail set at $35,000. Morses’s bail is set at $2,500, although he is not currently eligible for bail as he had an active felony warrant for his arrest at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>— Staff report</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50636\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50636\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/","id":3820,"author":{"id":271,"name":"Nexus Staff Report"},"related":[3819,3818,3817],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":7,"route":"/categories/news/crime","highestPage":13}},"__N_SSG":true}
