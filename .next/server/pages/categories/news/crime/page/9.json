The first theft was Friday, May 7 when five laptops were stolen from a residence on the 6500 block of Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>“The suspect entered into the unlocked house,” Padilla said. “I don’t believe it. These kids need to lock their doors and windows.”</p>\n<p>Several other laptops were stolen throughout the weekend. A computer was stolen from a residence on the 6700 block of Abrego Road on Saturday afternoon and two laptops were stolen from a parked car on Estero Road later that evening.</p>\n<p>On Friday afternoon another theft occurred when a suspect entered an unlocked car on the 6700 block Sabado Tarde Road and stole a laptop computer and a TomTom navigation device.</p>\n<p>Vandals also targeted a number of parked cars this weekend.</p>\n<p>Foot Patrol deputies were called to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road when an unknown suspect shattered the window of a young woman’s vehicle. Deputies also noted several reports of smashed side-view mirrors.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol deputies issued eight citations for public intoxication, in addition to 17 citations for minors in possession of alcohol and possession of open containers in public.</p>\n<p>Despite the alcohol-related crimes and high amount of thefts over the weekend, Deputy Freddy Padilla said no life-threatening incidents took place.</p>\n<p>“There were no violent crimes, nothing outrageous and, thankfully, no sexual assaults this weekend,” Padilla said. “I just hope that these kids lock their cars and houses and keep their valuables out of plain sight.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22567\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22567\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/","id":3832,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3831,3830,3829],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun.

May 2, 12:45 a.m. —</em> Officers were patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive when they noticed an especially rude young man yelling at passersby.</p>\n<p>“Fuckin’ Santa Barbara fool, what!” screamed the 20-year-old man. When a fellow reveler shot back a response, the intoxicated man yelled back, “Fuck you, fool!”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista’s finest wasn’t taking it, however, and took the pugnacious punk by the arm. He responded by saying, “Santa Barbara, born and raised, what!”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara local said that charges of him challenging others were “bullshit” and told officers, “I don’t give a fuck what you all think.” When asked how much alcohol he had consumed, he responded, “A few.”</p>\n<p>Because the rowdy SB rep was both intoxicated and challenging others, deputies arrested him and took him in to the station. On the way, the belligerent brawler apologized and confessed, “I deserved to be arrested; I admit, I was actin’ like a fool.”</p>\n<p>The deputies accepted the apology but nonetheless transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><strong>Is that a laptop in your pants or are you just happy to see me?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sun. May 2, 2:06 a.m. —</em> Deputies responding to a fight near the corner of Camino del Sur and Del Playa Drive were flagged down by Highway Patrol officers, who said they had detained a man in possession of stolen property.</p>\n<p>The subject — a 17-year-old male from Santa Barbara — was sitting on the ground with a gray Apple MacBook visibly poking out of the top of his pants.</p>\n<p>The clearly intoxicated juvenile said that he did not know where the computer came from and that a stranger had stuffed it down there. When cops handcuffed him and removed the stolen item, he shouted, “I think that’s Erin’s laptop.” Deputies asked him to go get Erin. He agreed, but came back to report that it, in fact, did not belong to Erin.</p>\n<p>During the remainder of their time with the feisty thief, officers had to hold him down to prevent him from biting or spitting on them.</p>\n<p>The young man was arrested for public intoxication and possession of stolen property and transported to Santa Barbara County Juvenile Hall, where he was housed, pending a beating from mommy.</p>\n<p><strong>“I want to be a part of it — New York, New York!”</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sat. May 1, 2:20 a.m. —</em> While on a routine patrol, officers spotted a group of people gathered around an intoxicated female on the 6500 block of Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>The group said that they didn’t know the wandering drunk, but had decided to help the sloppy single lady when they saw her staggering alone through the streets.</p>\n<p>When the officer asked what her name was, the 22-year-old said, “It doesn’t matter.” She proudly told the deputy that she was from New York, but also had a local address. Hoping not to arrest her, the cops asked if she could call a roommate to assist her home.</p>\n<p>That was not the question she wanted to hear, however, and the nostalgic New Yorker told them that she “hated” her roommates, “America,” and “this town.” She then shared that she desired nothing more than to return to Brooklyn.</p>\n<p>Officers said they were happy to give her a ride, but Brooklyn was just too far. Instead, the deputies transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22190\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22190\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/police-blotter-56/","id":3837,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3836,3835,3834],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Did he think it was open?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Did he think it was open?</em></p>\n<p>Sun.

Why don’t you go back inside!”</p>\n<p>The freshman and the frat boys began to exchange some heated words. The officer then told the drunken teenager he had two options — leave immediately or face arrest. Apparently looking for a fight, the first-year responded to the request by pushing the officer in the chest and shouting, “Don’t fucking touch me!”</p>\n<p>“Fuck you! Come on, do you want to go?” he asked the officer. And go they did. The deputy told the man that he was under arrest before wrestling him to the ground and handcuffing him.</p>\n<p>After hearing his Miranda rights, the forgetful freshie explained he did nothing wrong and denied any aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>In response to his arrest, he noted, “I’ve been through this before, you guys aren’t shit!”</p>\n<p>The feisty freshman was transported to Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/","id":3834,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3833,3832,3831],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Where’s the Stripper Pole?

When the officers arrived some minutes later, they found the sloppy squatter sitting in a large, comfy armchair.

And then, as only a frat guy could, he told the officers the others were just mad at him because he was going to take their girls.<br>\n\tThe girls, however, were safe for tonight.

Two hours earlier, the boozed burrito-buyer had nearly eaten shit right in front of the officers, not a block from Freebirds.</p>\n<p>At that time, the inebriated man was all alone. He told the officers it was his 21st birthday, which his ID confirmed, and they allowed him to call for a sober escort. When Jesus, his friend and savior, arrived minutes later, the deputies told him to take his legally drunk friend straight home.</p>\n<p>When the officers later spotted the blacked-out birthday boy outside Freebirds, he was even more intoxicated. The officers asked why he wasn’t at home, and he told them that he was still trying to find his way.</p>\n<p>His birthday nearly two hours past, the deputies felt no remorse in leading the 21-year-old to a bed… at the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Where’s Amy?</b></p>\n<p>Sat., Feb. 27, 1:50 a.m. — Deputies working the late shift were called to the 6600 block of Trigo Road on reports that someone was disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p>When the officers arrived, they spotted a young man pounding on the door of the apartment screaming to see “Amy Kim.” So fervent was the man in his quest to find Amy that he was, remarkably, foaming from the mouth.</p>\n<p>Even after the officers contacted the 20-year-old, he refused to stop screaming. In an attempt to diffuse the situation, one of the deputies knocked on the door and asked the residents if they knew where Amy was. The slightly frightened tenants informed the deputy they had never heard of Amy Kim before.</p>\n<p>However, this new piece of information did not persuade the ranting drunk, who accused the apartment dwellers of hiding his precious Amy.</p>\n<p>Seeing no way to convince him otherwise, the deputies did what they do best: arrested him.

After disappearing into its thick foliage, the bush lover was spotted crawling on her hands and knees out of the hedge and back onto the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Back on her feet, the twiggy gal then walked between two parked cars and squatted down. When the deputies arrived some moments later, they caught the young lady with her pants down… literally.</p>\n<p>Averting their eyes, the deputies waited for the 19-year-old woman to do up her pants and then sat her down on the curb to question her.

Look at all these people doing cocaine, and shit like that.”</p>\n<p>A quick glance into the street revealed no cocaine, however, and deputies calmly explained why they were “messing” with him. The deputies later transported the man to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>It’s Good, but Not That Good…</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 29, 3:47 p.m. — Domino’s new and improved pizza brought one drunken man to his knees… and into the hands of the law.</p>\n<p>Resisting the allure of fluffy, distinctly cardboard-free crust and bubbling, now-made-from-real-milk cheese, the deputies were walking past the I.V. pizzeria when they spotted the grown man blocking the entrance.</p>\n<p>The 44-year-old — a local resident — was kneeling just in front of the door with a nearly empty 24-ounce bottle of malt liquor sitting beside him. The clearly inebriated man had a wad of crumpled dollar bills in one hand and was yelling at the patrons gathered around him. While his words were unintelligible, one could only guess he was shouting about the greatness that is the new Domino’s pizza.</p>\n<p>As the deputies approached, they watched as the “pizza man” lost his balance and face-planted into the cement. He righted himself, only to fall face-first again. This was repeated several times until the officers arrived and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending discovery of the telephone.</p>\n<p><b>Neighborly Love</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 30, 2:31 a.m. — Deputies working the late shift were called to 6500 block of Seville on reports of a fight.</p>\n<p>Some time earlier, two men had been sitting in their apartment when they heard a knock on their door. They opened it to find their neighbor, heavily intoxicated and royally pissed about something.</p>\n<p>The 21-year-old was too drunk to use words however, and instead just punched his neighbor in the face. The motion proved too violent, however, as the inebriated man lost his balance and fell backward down the stairs.</p>\n<p>When the officers arrived, they found the pugnacious partier standing in the courtyard, bleeding from the cheek. The deputies attempted to talk with him, but all he would say was something about his neighbors “disrespecting” him.</p>\n<p>Unable to get any more out of him, the deputies arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20139\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20139\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/","id":3829,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3828,3827,3826],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Pantsless Partier Fri, Jan. 22, 11:24 p.m. — A man staggering down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive caught the attention of patrolling officers.

The deputies asked the 19-year-old if he had any identification with him and he told them, in thick, slurred speech, that it was in his pocket.</p>\n<p>The intoxicated reveler then reached into his pocket and, in so doing, pulled his pants down to his knees. Embarrassed, the pantsless partier tried to re-cover himself but was simply too drunk to do so. Luckily, the I.V. Foot Patrol are trained for all manner of situation, and one of the deputies was able to assist in pulling the exposed man’s trousers back up.</p>\n<p>With one disaster averted, the deputies moved on and asked the beltless boozer if he knew what street he was on. He replied he was on “Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>While no doubt a reasonable drunken answer, the deputies formed the opinion that the wasted walker was just too drunk and arrested him for public intoxication. He was later transferred to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>An I.V. Wizz</b></p>\n<p>Sun, Jan. 24, 12:47 p.m. — Deputies on a uniformed patrol watched as an inebriated reveler veered off the sidewalk, stumbled over some landscaping and face planted into a hedge of bushes.</p>\n<p>The officers, standing near the intersection of Camino Pescadero and Sabado Tarde, made their way towards the not-so-sure-footed drinker as he worked his way out of the bush. Getting to his feet, the 20-year-old made a step back towards the sidewalk, caught his foot on an innocent shrub, and went toppling back towards the ground.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived, helped the defeated drunk to his feet, and asked his name. He responded by muttering something undistinguishable. Not terribly surprised by the answer, the officers shrugged it off and asked him where he lived. While not quite a real street, his reply “Sabo Ardo” was at least close.</p>\n<p>It was at this point that the deputies picked up on the rancid smell of urine wafting through the air, and a quick glance at the reveler’s crotch confirmed he was the source. The urine stains were not confined to his jeans, however. Dark spots on his jacket sleeves suggested he had also managed to piss on his arms.</p>\n<p>Taking extra care not to get too much urine on their hands, the officers slapped cuffs on the pee-stained partier and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20068\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20068\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/","id":3827,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3826,3825,3824],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat Jan. 16, 1:12 a.m. - A parked car with its door opened wide caught the attention of officers driving westbound on Pasado Road.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Mind the Door</b></p>\n<p>Sat Jan. 16, 1:12 a.m. – A parked car with its door opened wide caught the attention of officers driving westbound on Pasado Road.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the car – a four-door Chevy truck – and shined their flashlights into the back seat. There, lying face down, was a victim of overconsumption, dreaming drunken dreams.</p>\n<p>His head half hanging out the opened door, the 19-year-old man was a sight to behold. Chunks of vomit clung to his face, covered his hands, stained his T-shirt and saturated the car seat. A few select chunks had made their way out of the car and were pooled in the gutter.</p>\n<p>The officers shook the sleeping beauty awake, taking extra care not to get vomit on their hands, and collected the out-of-towner’s information. Hoping not to have to arrest him, the deputies asked if the defeated reveler had any friends who could assist him.</p>\n<p>The puking prince told them José would come to his rescue and he pulled out his phone to dial him. However, after shouting his name several times, the officers asked to see the phone and discovered the soiled young man had never dialed the number.</p>\n<p>With no José, the deputies had no recourse but to arrest the young man.

A simple tap on the window didn’t wake the slumbering out-of-towners, however, nor did aggressive banging.</p>\n<p>The IVFP doesn’t employ quitters, though, and after nearly two minutes of trying, the deputies were able to wake the sloppy sleepers. What was awaiting them inside the car, however, no one can be trained for.</p>\n<p>First was the smell, horrid and acidic. Next the visual, two young bodies covered entirely in their own puke. Vomit was in their hair, on their clothing, covering their seats and pooled on the floor.</p>\n<p>Two grown adults could live with such an experience – at least their parents wouldn’t have to know. But these vomit-covered visitors were not so lucky: each was only 16 years of age.</p>\n<p>Slightly taken aback, the deputies arrested the pair and transferred them to the Santa Maria Juvenile Hall, where they were housed, pending a serious ass-whopping from the ‘rents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-20/police-blotter-46/","id":3825,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3824,3823,3822],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri Jan. 8, 11:15 p.m. - Officers on patrol Friday night were directed towards the corner of Del Playa Drive and Camino Lindo on reports of vehicular vandalism.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The Audacity of Douche</b><br>\nFri Jan. 8, 11:15 p.m. – Officers on patrol Friday night were directed towards the corner of Del Playa Drive and Camino Lindo on reports of vehicular vandalism.</p>\n<p>Minutes earlier, a young man was driving down the 6800 block of DP when a drunken savage came out of nowhere and leaped onto the roof of his car. Taken aback, the driver stepped on the gas and then abruptly hit the brakes in the hopes of shaking the crazed reveler, but succeeded only in shifting his body onto the hood.</p>\n<p>Reacting to this boorish move by the driver, the inebriated cowboy stood up on the hood, shouted “What the fuck?!” and slammed his heel through the front windshield, shattering it instantly.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived some minutes later, and, thanks to their superb training, were able to track down the suspect without difficulty. It was made easier, however, by the fact that their man had managed to fall asleep while standing.</p>\n<p>The officers woke the 20-year-old Menlo Park resident and put him in handcuffs. Having been read his Miranda rights, the vandal turned to the officer and said, “I would like to know what I’m being charged with.” The deputy explained that kicking through a windshield is in fact a crime, to which the suspect replied, “I just want to know what I’m being charged with.”</p>\n<p>Despite several explanations, the inebriated man was unable to comprehend why he was arrested.

She told the deputies she wouldn’t leave without her cell phone battery, but after a moving good cop/bad cop routine, the officers were able to convince her otherwise.</p>\n<p>Love is a difficult beast to break, however. An hour and a half later, the deputies received another call saying that the girl had returned, this time with even more alcohol on her breath. The deputies arrived and escorted her out of the apartment and down the stairs.</p>\n<p>At first refusing to answer any questions, the UCSB student quickly changed tactics and demanded that the officers take her to jail. To prove she was serious, she then ordered them to do so.</p>\n<p>Happy to oblige, the deputies took her to the I.V. substation, where she insisted they give her a breathalyzer test. The deputy instructed her that was not necessary, but she continued to demand one.</p>\n<p>The issue was put to rest, however, when the officers transferred her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/","id":3906,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3905,3904,3903],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"That’s a Bush, Not a Bed Sat., Nov. 14, 12:03 a.m. — A heavily intoxicated man seated on the curb attracted the attention of several passing revelers and, subsequently, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol....","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>That’s a Bush,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Not a Bed</strong></p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 14, 12:03 a.m. — A heavily intoxicated man seated on the curb attracted the attention of several passing revelers and, subsequently, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>Seated near the intersection of Pasado Road and Camino Corto, the 18-year-old had seemingly reached, and then surpassed, his limit.

They asked the man his name, to which he replied, “What’s my name.” When asked his age, he replied “What’s my age.”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the inebriated local would answer by simply repeating the question.

After nearly falling on own his volition, the Cal Poly Mustang then stumbled into a fair-skinned Gaucho, who nearly fell herself.</p>\n<p>After being told off, the drunken man turned and tried out his best pick up line: “Fuck you!” But instead of snatching one of Isla Vista’s famed beauties, he was snatched by I.V.’s other famed demographic, the not-so-beautiful Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>A quick conversation with the foul-mouthed Mustang was all the fodder the officers needed, who promptly arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/","id":3905,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3904,3903,3902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., Oct. 16, 11:22 p.m. -- A group of men gathered around an empty lot at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista's finest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The Puking Princess</b></p>\n<p>Fri., Oct. 16, 11:22 p.m. — A group of men gathered around an empty lot at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>As the deputies made their way toward the crowd, they spotted the group’s focal point: a young lady bent over vomiting in the grass. Several of the men had their phones out and were taking pictures.</p>\n<p>The deputies then watched as the inebriated 18-year-old pushed herself up only to slip and fall face first into a pile of her own sick.</p>\n<p>Wiping the vomit from her face, the drunken female righted herself and started to walk off, completely unaware she was being followed by the police.</p>\n<p>A deputy grabbed her by the arm and tried to talk with the puking princess, but she was utterly unaware of her surroundings, making for bad conversation. Given that everyone else had scattered upon their arrival, the officers decided it was best to arrest her and transport her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Parking Lot Blues</b></p>\n<p>Sat. Oct. 17, 2:30 a.m. — Residents of 781 Embarcadero Del Norte were rudely awoken early Saturday morning to the obnoxious antics of one especially intoxicated partier.</p>\n<p>According to the reporting party, the 20-year-old male had stumbled up to the apartment complex, of which he was not a tenant, and then proceeded to kick and bang on several apartment doors.</p>\n<p>The young man’s run as the most insufferable idiot on the block was short lived, however. When officers arrived some minutes later, they found the rambunctious reveler passed out cold in the parking lot behind the building.</p>\n<p>The deputies attempted to rouse the sleepy squatter but he was unable to do anything but crawl around on all fours. And if that weren’t enough proof, the large urine stains on the man’s jeans suggested he was too drunk to take care of himself.</p>\n<p>Despite his self-professed desire to sleep in the parking lot, the officers offered something more comfortable, albeit just barely, and transported the infantile student to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Just a Beer… or 10</b></p>\n<p>Fri. Oct. 16, 11:40 a.m. — After losing his balance and nearly falling to the ground, a lone partier found himself in the hands of the law.</p>\n<p>Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive decided to stop the staggering 18-year-old, whose clothing was soiled with dirt, and check on his welfare.</p>\n<p>The officers inquired into his alcohol consumption for the night, and the blatantly drunk man told them he had barely had anything to drink. His cover was blown, however, when he told the deputies he lived at 3022 Trigo Rd., which, unfortunately, does not exist.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Jail, however, certainly exists and was happy to house the lost boy, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19531\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19531\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/","id":3842,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3841,3840,3839],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":9,"route":"/categories/news/crime","highestPage":13}},"__N_SSG":true}
