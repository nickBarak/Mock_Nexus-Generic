According to witness reports, the 19-year-old male said he was going for a quick dip in the Pacific. However, his friends’ reported they were confident he did not know how to swim and forgot his floaties at home.</p>\n<p>After arriving on the 6500 block of Del Playa, officers attempted to prevent the subject from going down to the beach and escort him back to a securely landlocked patrol car. However, the aquatics enthusiast resisted officers’ attempts to shepherd him away from the sea, proclaiming his desire to “look at the offshore oil rigs”.</p>\n<p>Officers reported the subject’s decibel level rarely dropped below shouting volume. Despite the risk of ruptured eardrums, IVFP learned from the would-be-merman he had consumed “about 4 beers” after suffering estrangement from his significant other.</p>\n<p>IVFP eventually managed to get the subject into a patrol car. The wannabe Phelps was booked for public intoxication.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43696\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43696\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/","id":3808,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3807,3806,3805],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Following a somewhat high-speed chase through the streets of Isla Vista, I.V.

Foot Patrol officers apprehended a suspect — dressed, painted and hair-sprayed entirely green — on suspicion of public intoxication and disorderly conduct shortly after midnight on Nov. 1.</p>\n<p>After the jolly green reveler noticed that he had caught the attention of local authorities, he strolled into oncoming traffic in opposition to officers’ requests that he accompany them to the curb for a sobriety test and narrowly avoided being struck by a westbound vehicle. The emerald escapist then fled on foot up Del Playa Drive, promptly colliding with a stop sign on the corner of Camino Pescadero.</p>\n<p>However, the Green Lantern never gives up without a fight and, in a superhuman feat of agility, remained upright and continued his flight with several deputies in pursuit.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the hope that his green face paint and hair coloring would serve as better camouflage off the street, the fleet-footed suspect sought refuge in a nearby residence on DP. As the cops followed him into the house, he made a ninja turtle-worthy leap over the back fence into another nearby residence.</p>\n<p>Following the indignant cries of the Del Playa residents — none of whom wished to press trespassing charges — officers eventually apprehended the mischievous leprechaun inside a third DP residence.</p>\n<p>Upon his arrest, the captured fugitive articulated that he wanted to provide deputies with a formal statement. However, after the suspect was transferred to the I.V. Foot Patrol station for processing, his remarks were found to be incoherent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/","id":3818,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3817,3816,3815],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While trick-or-ticketing the fertile hunting grounds of Del Playa Drive this weekend, Santa Barbara Sheriff’s deputies stumbled upon an 18-year-old man in possession of a criminal quantity of Hallow...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>While trick-or-ticketing the fertile hunting grounds of Del Playa Drive this weekend, Santa Barbara Sheriff’s deputies stumbled upon an 18-year-old man in possession of a criminal quantity of Halloween spirit.</p>\n<p>Officers approached the suspect on the corner of DP and Camino Del Sur after noticing the savage’s attempt to hide a distinctive blue bottle — later identified as a partially-empty fifth of Skyy Pineapple vodka — behind his back.</p>\n<p>While the exact wording of the officer’s salutation remains unknown, the cliché “reach for the Skyy, punk” would have likely been applicable as the man initially resisted deputies’ efforts to remove the precious nectar from his possession. Summoning his inner wild side, the juiced juvenile used the bottle as his personal machete and took a determined swing at one officer. While Pineapple Skyy may be good at knocking out freshmen just graduating from wine coolers, it was significantly less effective on trained law enforcement officials; the suspect was quickly disarmed and muzzled up with a personal pair of handcuffs.</p>\n<p>Despite his constraints, the fermented-fruit-sipping fiend was not yet ready to throw in the towel. When officers discovered a glass bottle of marijuana in the boy’s pocket, he took advantage of the distraction and, having already lost the fight, went with the other instinct and scrambled down Sabado Tarde Road with his hands still cuffed. Though cuffs can often make people quicker in the bedroom, the same cannot be said for the cantering criminal, who was quickly chased down and tackled … again.</p>\n<p>The suspect ended his tropical tonic-fueled adventures along with several other primal pals in the Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42565\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42565\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/","id":3817,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3816,3815,3814],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"During a nightly stroll through Camino Pescadero Park on the 6500 Block of Del Playa Drive at around 11 p.m. on Friday, deputies happened upon a young female giving a golden shower to the grass — an...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>During a nightly stroll through Camino Pescadero Park on the 6500 Block of Del Playa Drive at around 11 p.m. on Friday, deputies happened upon a young female giving a golden shower to the grass — and her hands, feet and legs — against the fence of the park.</p>\n<p>When asked for identification, the mysterious woman began handing officers trash from the bottom of her purse and then offered up her camera in the hopes her latest materials for a wittily-titled Facebook album could serve as proper photographic identification.</p>\n<p>Although she initially denied having consuming any alcoholic beverages, the sodden Swede eventually conceded she had “a few shots of liquor” as she struggled to stay upright en route to a seat on a nearby bench.</p>\n<p>The situation continued to worsen as IVFP deputies arrested her for public intoxication due to her spectacular failure at spelling her own first name (switching some Ds with Ts and missing a few crucial vowels).

The resident saw a thief using the light of a cell phone to navigate the apartment before making off with a flat screen television and a computer.</p>\n<p>Similar incidents continued throughout the month, including an instance of thieves striking two apartments in the same building on the 900 block of Camino del Sur.</p>\n<p>In addition to investigating residential burglaries, Foot Patrol deputies also responded to several violent crimes during the month of July, including two cases of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Foot Patrol officers were called to the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive on July 25 after a 19-year-old man reportedly raped a woman. Vuillemainroy said the survivor was assaulted after her roommates had allowed the man into their apartment.</p>\n<p>“He then stepped into the woman’s bedroom where he forcibly raped her,” Vuillemainroy said. “She yelled for help and her roommates rushed to her and pulled him off.”</p>\n<p>Authorities later identified and arrested the man in an in-field line-up.</p>\n<p>Other cases of physical assault were reported, including an incident on the evening of July 24 where three men harassed people with a stun gun at three separate parties.</p>\n<p>“The men were threatening to stun people with a stun gun,” Vuillemainroy said. “One person was actually stunned but is okay now.”</p>\n<p>Authorities successfully arrested the assailants.</p>\n<p>Deputies also responded to a standard number of vandalisms and alcohol-related crimes during July.

IVFP Deputy Freddy Padilla said the individual had passed out in the street after a fight. The victim was rushed to the hospital after brief questioning.</p>\n<p>“The victim said he was knocked out cold, and deputies saw blood was on his mouth,” Padilla said. “The officers noted that the victim appeared highly intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>An hour later, deputies responded to another fight that began when an intoxicated man was attacked while sleeping on his couch at home.</p>\n<p>“The victim was passed out on the living room couch,” Padilla said. “An unknown male attacked him while he was on the couch and hit him multiple times in the face.”</p>\n<p>According to Padilla, the fight was instigated earlier in the evening when the victim of the fight assaulted the attacker’s girlfriend.</p>\n<p>“She was at a party and was kneed in the abdomen by the male victim,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>Padilla said because the suspect fled the scene after the attack, authorities have been unable to identify him.</p>\n<p>Officers also responded to two residential thefts over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Burglars stole a laptop computer from a residence on the 6600 block of Sueno Road at 4 a.m. Saturday morning.

Padilla said these thefts might have been avoided if residents had taken precautions prior to leaving their homes.</p>\n<p>“It is really unfortunate that this happens so frequently,” Padilla said. “For whatever reason they leave their places unlocked or their windows open, and people are able to come inside and take their belongings.”</p>\n<p>Deputies also encountered a case of vandalism Saturday night when a Foot Patrol officer spotted a woman defacing a vehicle on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The officer stopped the vandal and questioned her, but chose not to make an arrest.</p>\n<p>“The female suspect was detained by the officer, but for whatever reason he decided not to arrest her.
