I’m 18. I know. I know.” He tried the question again, but again she muttered the same response. Ten times he asked, and always got the same answer.</p>\n<p>But when asked her date of birth, the “18-year-old” told them 7-4-92, making her 17. When told this, she started to cry and tried to walk away.</p>\n<p>But the officer caught a glimpse of her cell phone and asked to use it to call her mother.

The inebriated performer was in the zone, however, and failed to heed the officer’s demand.</p>\n<p>The deputies, having already tried their hands at diplomacy, reverted to plan B and grabbed the artist by the shirt and dragged him to the ground.</p>\n<p>With his run as lead dancer in the Car-top Cabaret over, the rising star was forced to face the music and stood motionless as the deputies slapped on the cuffs.</p>\n<p>And the Damage Done</p>\n<p>Sun., Sept. 27, 1:13 a.m. — A late night altercation in a Del Playa parking lot turned out to be more than one officer could handle.</p>\n<p>Once on the scene, the officers approached a bloodied 18-year-old and asked him what had happened, to which he replied, “Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz…” Pressed further, the out-of-towner continued to ramble about California’s favorite hippie enclave, but ironically, refused to say where he was from.</p>\n<p>With no other options, the deputy arrested him and sat him on the curb to wait for a van to take him to jail. But the slug wasn’t ready to be salted just yet, and while the officer was looking down at his notepad, he made his break and started sprinting down the street.</p>\n<p>The deputy made chase, and his attempts to taser the escapee failed. And then his own legs failed him: just paces from catching up, the officer lost his footing and ate shit in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Officers don’t work alone, though, and a fellow member of the Foot Patrol was able to tackle the fleeing northerner. The damage, however, had already been done.</p>\n<p>If Only It Was Twist-Off</p>\n<p>Fri., Sept. 15, 11:28 p.m. — Deputies on patrol near the intersection of Camino Del Sur and Pasado Road stopped an inebriated man after he stumbled into several parked cars.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the unsteady stroller where he lived, and he was quick to tell them that he lived at “243 Sabado.” But before the deputies could tell him such an address doesn’t exist, he pointed to a house at the corner of the intersection and told them he lived there.</p>\n<p>Feeling pretty certain that the 20-year-old was making things up, the deputies asked the lost boy if he could call a friend to walk him home. The drunken UCSB student said he could and proceeded to pull out his keys from his front pocket.</p>\n<p>Unsure of his intentions, the officers asked him a second time if he would call a friend. This time, the man pointed to a bottle opener attached to his keys and said, “O.K., it’s right here.”</p>\n<p>Whether he thought the bottle opener was a phone, or perhaps a friendly escort, the officers couldn’t tell, but such clarification was not needed to arrest him for public intoxication.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19349\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19349\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/","id":3903,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3902,3901,3900],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Best of Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Wed., Oct. 15, 3:48 p.m. - Deputies enjoying a sunny Wednesday afternoon were called to duty when they witnessed a young lady struggling to walk near the intersection of Embarcadero del Norte and Pica...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Soggy Bottomed Girl<br>\nWed., Oct. 15, 3:48 p.m. – Deputies enjoying a sunny Wednesday afternoon were called to duty when they witnessed a young lady struggling to walk near the intersection of Embarcadero del Norte and Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>The officers watched the stumbling stroller for approximately one block, during which she weaved back and forth, stumbled into innocent passersby and fell into a bush. She had another female with her, but she was not assisting the inebriated.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the 19-year-old woman, and immediately picked up on the strong odor of alcohol coming from her person.</p>\n<p>They asked the young woman where she was coming from and she replied that she had just left her sorority. She was then asked where she was heading, and she replied her sorority.</p>\n<p>When asked how much she had had to drink, she said, “Enough.” After speaking with her friend, the officers learned that they had come from the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity house, where the various sororities had been competing in a “gladiator style” sporting event.</p>\n<p>She was arrested and transported to the Isla Vista sub-station on Trigo Road. There she was placed on a chair in the holding cell, but after a half-hour of repeatedly falling off she was moved to the floor.</p>\n<p>Her intoxication seemed to be increasing, and at times she lost consciousness. Then, she began to urinate, soaking her shorts and the ground that she was sitting on. She made no attempt to move and ultimately passed out in a puddle of her own urine.</p>\n<p>The sorority girl was then transported to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for alcohol overdose, but was ultimately released back to the sheriff’s department and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>You’re No Jim Morrison<br>\nFri., April 25, 12:56 a.m. – Informed by numerous people of a man lying in the grass at Sea Outlook Park, located on the 6800 block of Del Playa Drive, a bicycle patrol officer made his way to the area.</p>\n<p>When the deputy approached the park, he saw a man lying on his side, seemingly unconscious, with both his pants and underwear pulled down to mid-thigh. Despite his apparent efforts to stay dry, his trousers were soaked and the man stunk of urine.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the 23-year old was positioned in such that the view from the street was one featuring his naked ass. Also, the man’s left shoe was removed and sitting near his head.</p>\n<p>The officer, fearing for the inebriated man’s health, called paramedics and attempted to rouse the urine-soaked, half-naked, mostly unconscious partier.</p>\n<p>Succeeding in having the man open his eyes, the deputy asked the pungent-smelling sleeper for some basic information, such as his name and age. This man, however, had simply consumed too much to partake in simple conversation.</p>\n<p>In response to the officer’s questions, the man rambled off a series of no’s and then jammed out on his imaginary air guitar.</p>\n<p>After paramedics determined the man was not in need of immediate medical attention, he was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>\n<p>A Beautiful Mind<br>\nThursday, Jan. 31, 2:12 a.m. – Officers stationed at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office were informed of a drunken woman who was unable to pay the bill for a cab ride.</p>\n<p>The woman, who was dropped off on Pardall Road, was returning from a night out at a Goleta bar.</p>\n<p>The ride-stealing suspect had had a bit too much to drink however, and appeared to have some loose change after all.</p>\n<p>Clearly alone, the woman was convinced there was another person inside the cab when she had entered.</p>\n<p>Putting the issue of the disappearing passenger aside, the officer asked the woman how she had planned to pay for the taxi.</p>\n<p>She calmly told the deputy that she was going to pay the fare of $16.75 using her cell phone. The suspect tried to complete the transaction several times, but despite her sincerest efforts, her mobile would not issue legal tender.</p>\n<p>With her phone apparently void of its magic-giving abilities, the woman lost her composure and resorted to screaming and yelling.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19170\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19170\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/","id":3852,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3851,3850,3849],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat., May 2, 11:17 p.m. - The bumping rhythms emanating from the balcony of the Marley House - 6566 Del Playa Dr. - piqued the interest of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When Stupidity Wins Out<br>\nSat., May 2, 11:17 p.m. – The bumping rhythms emanating from the balcony of the Marley House – 6566 Del Playa Dr. – piqued the interest of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>With a raucous group ahead, the officers made their way through the crowd and to the stairwell where they found their first victim: a minor with an open beer.</p>\n<p>But the real prize was just starting to make his way down the stairs. With a bottle of Andre’s sparkling wine in one hand and a cigar in the other, the sunglass-clad 18-year-old was too cool for his own good. The officers stopped the hipster and asked his age. After briefly hesitating, he told the officers he was 21.</p>\n<p>The deputies weren’t fooled, however, and asked to see his ID. The champagne sipper reached for his wallet, paused and then decided it was better to just run. Wine still in hand, he pushed past the officers and sprinted onto DP.</p>\n<p>The officers immediately gave chase, and even tried to taser the sprinting bro, though unsuccessfully. The deputies did manage to spot him zipping into a backyard on Sabado Tarde, and after some cunning police work, officers apprehended the inebriated young man.</p>\n<p>The deputies then escorted him to their patrol car and drove him toward the Santa Barbara County Jail. While in transit, the defeated SBCC student spontaneously told the officers that he only ran because he thought he was going to be arrested. Officers promptly informed him that he would have only received a citation.</p>\n<p>“So you mean I would have just gotten a ticket?” asked the dismayed reveler just before being booked into the jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Don’t Forget to Flush<br>\nSun., May 3, 2:56 a.m. – Employees working the Saturday night shift at Silvergreens Restaurant were all set to go home when they found a surprise in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>There, slouched over the toilet, lay a young woman sound asleep. Attempts to rouse her proved ineffective and the tired-eyed employees instead sought the help of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived some minutes later and were led into the bathroom. There the officers found the 20-year-old sleeping blissfully upon the white ceramic seat, her hair mussed and her pants still around her ankles. She had, it appeared, fallen asleep in the act of peeing.</p>\n<p>So intoxicated was the UCSB student, however, that it took the officers several minutes to wake her from her drunken stupor. Only after lifting her head and vigorously shaking her arm did she even respond.</p>\n<p>Having finally succeeded in rousing her, the deputies attempted to retrieve some basic information. The sloppy sleeper, however, was unable to form coherent words and instead took to spitting repeatedly on the floor.</p>\n<p>With that, the officers arrested the drunken squatter. She was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Hurricane<br>\nMon., May 11, 12:42 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to 6690 Abrego Rd. on reports that a heavily tattooed man was wreaking havoc at the apartment complex.</p>\n<p>A result copious amounts of alcohol and too much testosterone, the inebriated man was a walking disaster. According to the reporting party, the 23-year-old had been breaking glass bottles and smashing bikes, apparently just for the fun of it.</p>\n<p>When the deputies arrived, they found the San Jose native with his pants down urinating on the door to an apartment. The pugnacious pisser was cognizant enough to notice the officers, however, and quickly sucked up the pain and turned off the nozzle.</p>\n<p>Having easily found their suspect, the deputies took a moment to check their surroundings. It was as if a tornado had ripped through the apartment complex, with broken glass strewn in every corner and several bikes submerged in the pool.</p>\n<p>Despite being the only person in the vicinity, the self-professed musician adamantly denied having caused any of the destruction. The officers weren’t fazed and arrested the man anyway.</p>\n<p>He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/","id":3851,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3850,3849,3848],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat., March 25, 1:30 a.m. - Officers on patrol on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive when they were rudely interrupted.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold<br>\nSat., March 25, 1:30 a.m. – Officers on patrol on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive when they were rudely interrupted.</p>\n<p>“Fuck the Police,” shouted an intoxicated passerby, almost as if he was looking for trouble. The deputies were happy to oblige.</p>\n<p>After stopping the 20-year-old, who was on his way to a large party at 6567 DP, the deputies asked the pugnacious partier to repeat himself.</p>\n<p>But with Isla Vista’s finest in his face, the smack talker suddenly fell silent. Reveling in the irony, the officers goaded the inebriated man, asking him if he were too drunk to realize what he had said.</p>\n<p>“No, I didn’t say anything,” he said, but the deputies were quick to refresh his memory. After some convincing, the man finally admitted to his actions, saying “I’ve had a lot to drink.”</p>\n<p>The cops, however, were not sympathetic and arrested the man for public intoxication. A quick search revealed the man was also carrying a small baggie filled with leafy marijuana, like icing on the cake.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>No Burritos After Two<br>\nFri., March 24, 2:26 a.m. – Deputies working the late shift were put to work when a late-night Bill’s Bus arrived in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as one particularly inebriated man exited the bus, made his away across the adjacent park and unzipped his pants. Unaware he was being watched, the 23-year-old let it flow, dousing the building he was next to in his own pungent smell.</p>\n<p>Even though he hadn’t yet finished spelling his name in urine, the officers spoke up and kindly asked him to stop peeing on the building.</p>\n<p>The aging UCSB student had a retort ready and told the officers it was okay, “because I keep this business going by purchasing burritos from them.”</p>\n<p>Despite his stellar logic, there was one serious problem with his argument: He was peeing on the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic – a distinctly burrito-free establishment.</p>\n<p>This fact notwithstanding, the man finished his business with the wall and then nearly fell over, prompting the deputies to arrest him and transport him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Taxi Cab Blues<br>\nSat., March 25, 11:48 p.m. – Officers were called to the corner of El Colegio and Los Carnernos Roads after an inebriated man refused to pay for his taxi.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived and learned that the 24-year-old owed 60 dollars to the cab driver, who had tried collecting the tab repeatedly without success. However, after talking with the young man – who was sporting a suit and pink tie – the officers determined that he did not have any money to pay the driver.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Los Angeles native appeared to have no idea where he was. When asked where he had been picked up, the ride snatcher said he had left from Isla Vista. Then, when asked where he had wanted to be dropped off, he told the deputies Isla Vista, again.</p>\n<p>As the officers processed his paperwork, the man became increasingly confused, at one point asking the officer where his car was and whether it had been towed. He seemed not to remember any car ride, however, and later refused to pay.</p>\n<p>His reason: The cab driver was not in the country legally. The validity of this statement notwithstanding, the officers arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/","id":3849,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3848,3847,3846],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., April 17, 11:11 p.m. -- Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive couldn't help but pay attention when an intoxicated male started running back and forth down the middle of street, d...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Pledging My Time</p>\n<p>Fri., April 17, 11:11 p.m. — Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive couldn’t help but pay attention when an intoxicated male started running back and forth down the middle of street, doing summersaults and shouting incoherently.</p>\n<p>So jubilant was the 22-year-old that he somersaulted right into an officer. The deputy, who was unharmed by the drunken gymnast, asked the young man what he was doing.</p>\n<p>Realizing he was speaking to a figure of authority, the inebriated man stood tall, his back rigid, and shouted, “Pledging my sorority, sir!”</p>\n<p>The gender-confused man didn’t have any identification on him and refused, or was simply unable, to give any personal information to the officers and instead continued to yell about his pledging efforts. Then realizing he was about to be arrested, the self-described Marine dropped to the ground, put his face to the asphalt and put his hands behind his back, shouting, “This is what I do when I get arrested, sir!”</p>\n<p>Not wishing to appear rude, the deputies arrested the hopeful pledge and started toward the patrol car. The drunken serviceman was not done being arrested, though, and dropped to the ground face-down several more times before the officers could get him in the car.</p>\n<p>Once seated, the young man lost his cool and started slamming his head against the Plexiglas divider. A few drunken hissy fits later, the deputy was forced to spray mace into his eyes.</p>\n<p> Eventually the alcohol-laden 22-year-old was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Getting Trashed</p>\n<p>Sun., April 19, 1:25 a.m. — Officers responding to reports of an unresponsive male lying on the ground behind 6571 Del Playa Drive found a heavily intoxicated man struggling to stay upright.</p>\n<p>The deputies contacted the 18-year-old as he was loitering about the large dumpsters behind the ocean-side apartment complex. The young UCSB student was clearly inebriated, as evidenced by the copious amounts of urine and vomit staining his jeans.</p>\n<p>The officers attempted to start a conversation with the man while they waited for paramedics to arrive, but his ability to speak had apparently been drowned in alcohol. He may, however, have just been preoccupied with something else, given that he had both hands stuffed down his heavily soiled pants. No matter the question, the self-fondling dumpster diver just stood there shivering, no doubt chilled by his moist trousers.</p>\n<p>Some time later, the paramedics arrived but eventually released the dubious drunkard back into police custody, who arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was given fresh clothing and housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Double the Drunk</p>\n<p>Sat., April 18, 1:32 a.m. — Deputies on patrol were called to 6681 Del Playa Drive to deal with a reported disturbance.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, the officers witnessed a pair of twin brothers leaving an upstairs party. The two, both well beyond drunk, stumbled towards the staircase: their first obstacle.</p>\n<p>The first brother clutched the handrail tightly, eventually making it down the stairs without incident. His partner in crime, however, went full-bore down the stairs, nearly tumbling several times. It was not until he reached flat ground, however, that gravity won the battle and he fell to the pavement.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the first twin put one foot in front of the other until he reached the second main obstacle: a wooden gate. Having traveled the 30 feet to the gate, the brother could go no farther, fell to the ground and was unable to get back up.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, twin number two recovered from his tumble and made his way to the gate. His attempts to open it, however, were foiled by the fact he reached for the hinge instead of the latch.</p>\n<p>After about a minute of watching the two try to open the gate, the deputies felt obliged and opened it for them. With no other obstacles standing in their way, the 20-year-old twins were arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where they were housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/","id":3850,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3849,3848,3847],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Love may well have been in the air Saturday night, but so too was the familiar smell of alcohol-laden partiers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The City of Love?<br>\nSat. Feb. 14, 10:20 p.m. – Love may well have been in the air Saturday night, but so too was the familiar smell of alcohol-laden partiers.</p>\n<p>Deputies working the Valentine’s Day shift were pulled away from their romantic dreams when a clearly intoxicated individual stumbled out of the apartment complex at 6653 Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>The 18-year-old – who was, not surprisingly, alone and completely hammered – was having a difficult time navigating the parking lot. The officers watched as he stumbled into a parked car, then into a filthy dumpster, back into another parked car and finally out onto the street. There, the pinball wizard continued to run into cars, nearly eating it with every step.</p>\n<p>Stepping in, the deputies contacted the lonely partier and escorted him to the curb. There they tried to talk to the young man, who was not from Isla Vista, but quickly ran into a hurdle: the man could barely speak English.</p>\n<p>Slightly aghast that he was alone on Valentine’s Day, the officers ascertained that the severely drunk man was French. Lucky for them, a random passerby happened to speak the lovely language and started to translate for the deputies.</p>\n<p>The conservation was cut short, however, when the f’ed-up Frenchman leaned over and started to vomit profusely on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>With no other options, the officers arrested the lover-less lover-boy and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Under Intoxicated<br>\nSat. Feb. 14, 12:40 a.m. – A man carrying a full glass of amber-colored liquid stepped out onto the 6700 block of Trigo Road and into the sights of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>Having broken a cardinal rule of drinking in I.V., the inebriated individual made an easy target for the Foot Patrol, who quickly approached him and inquired into the glass’ contents.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the 22-year-old turned and started to pour the beverage onto the ground. Unfortunately for him, he was not quick enough and the officer reached out and grabbed the glass.</p>\n<p>The deputies asked the visiting Burbank resident what was in the glass, and he claimed he didn’t know. Taking him for a liar, the officers then asked if it was beer or hard alcohol, and, with his back to the corner, he said, “Probably beer.”</p>\n<p>Having solved the beverage issue, the deputies then noticed that the man’s shirt was torn from the neckline down, and that his bare, hairless chest was exposed for all to see. The deputies, relying on their deft deduction skills, asked if he had been in a fight and he nodded in agreement, but refused to say with whom.</p>\n<p>Moving on, the officers asked the out-of-towner how much he had had to drink, to which he replied, “Honestly, too much.” Taking that as their cue, they arrested the intoxicated reveler. With the cuffs on, they asked if he knew why he had been arrested and he answered, matter-of-factly, “Because I am under intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>The deputies then proceeded to escort the man to the station, during which time the -year-old looked down at his shirt, and with a puzzled look, asked how it got torn. The officers told him it was that way when they found him, but he said he didn’t believe them.</p>\n<p>The officers didn’t really mind though, because shortly after he was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/","id":3848,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3847,3846,3845],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., Feb. 8, 1:55 a.m. - Officers working the red-eye were called to action when they spotted an inebriated man struggling to walk down the 800 block of Camino del Sur.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>23 Flavors<br>\nSun., Feb. 8, 1:55 a.m. – Officers working the red-eye were called to action when they spotted an inebriated man struggling to walk down the 800 block of Camino del Sur.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the young man, who was carrying a half-full Dr. Pepper bottle, and asked him how he was doing. The out-of-towner quickly put a halt to his swaying saunter and mumbled something incoherent in response.</p>\n<p>The lack of a comprehensible reply was enough of an answer for the officers and they proceeded to ask the 19-year-old what he was drinking. This time the officers didn’t get any response, and instead the young man hung his head low and stared at the street while snot dripped down from his nose.</p>\n<p>At one point, however, the late-night reveler attempted to look up at the officers, but the movement was too much for his alcohol-laden body and he nearly toppled over from a lack of balance.</p>\n<p>With the prospect of constructive conversation out of the question, the officers asked to smell the contents of the bottle. Without saying a word, the young man handed it over and the deputies quickly determined that the beverage was not just Dr. Pepper but an intoxicating cousin of the good doctor.</p>\n<p>Suspecting that the underage partier may have more than a spiked Dr. Pepper on his person, the officers asked the busted whippersnapper if they could check his pockets, which he unfortunately agreed to. A quick frisk later, the officers discovered two pill bottles filled with marijuana and another small box with additional herb and a small white pill, later identified as Xanax.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the sloppy stoner didn’t have a prescription for the pot or the Xanax and was arrested for public intoxication as well as possession of a controlled substance. He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Witch Made Me Do It<br>\nThurs., Feb. 5, 1:59 a.m. – Deputies rounding the Embarcadero loop early Thursday morning suddenly found themselves in a Technicolor adventure, Isla Vista style.</p>\n<p>There, in front of the Isla Vista Medical Center, was a yellow brick road of sorts. Only instead of bricks, the path consisted of urine-stained cement. With the musk of human waste in the air, Isla Vista’s finest were off.</p>\n<p>Following the sodden trail to its headwaters, the deputies discovered the source: an intoxicated transient asleep at the door of the medical center. Only there was no man behind the curtain; what they saw was what they got, and the officers quickly determined the river of human piss was coming from the pants of the sleeping squatter.</p>\n<p>Since “camping” on a public sidewalk is illegal, the deputies awoke the passed-out pisser and told him to stand up. The 47-year-old did as he was told, but had to rely heavily on the support of the door to maintain his balance.</p>\n<p>The deputies noted that his pants were soaked in his own bodily fluids, yet nonetheless searched the man – with his consent – for any drugs or weapons.</p>\n<p>Having failed to produce any contraband, the officers arrested the trespassing transient for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The University of Santa California, Barbara<br>\nSat., Feb. 7, 12:34 a.m. – Officers braving a cold and wet Isla Vista night spotted a young male snooping around a fenced yard and decided to investigate.</p>\n<p>The UCSB student was staggering around a fence on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Rd., clearly intoxicated. So unsure was his footing that he had to resort to crouching by the fence to keep from falling over.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the sloppy squatter and asked him if he was all right. Caught off guard, the 20-year-old turned to walk towards the officers but instead slipped and ate it.</p>\n<p>Now on the ground, the intoxicated man assured the officers that he was fine and that he was simply waiting for a friend to arrive.</p>\n<p>The deputy reached down and gave the fallen soldier a hand getting to his feet, and kept his arm there in case his balance gave out a second time.</p>\n<p>The officers then proceeded to ask the standard array of questions – name, address, age – but when they got to his school, the drunken student had some problems. “U-S-C-B,” was his first attempt, quickly followed by “U-C-B-S.”</p>\n<p>With all the evidence they needed, the deputies arrested the tipsy, tongue-tied traveler for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18295\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18295\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/","id":3847,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3846,3845,3844],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Breaking and Undressing\nSun., Jan. 25, 12:37 a.m. - Officers stationed on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were approached by an unidentified male who told them an unknown female had entered his home...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Breaking and Undressing<br>\nSun., Jan. 25, 12:37 a.m. – Officers stationed on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were approached by an unidentified male who told them an unknown female had entered his home at 6614 DP.</p>\n<p>According to the resident, the inebriated woman – whom he had never met before – had entered his house, taken off all her clothing and vomited on the floor of his bathroom. As an afterthought, the man told the officers the sickly squatter was also bleeding from the forehead.</p>\n<p>Intrigued, the deputies followed the man to his house and into the bathroom. There, they found an 18-year old girl sitting atop a pile of her own puke, completely in the nude, blood trickling down from an eyebrow piercing.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the drunken CSU Northridge student if she knew where she was or whose house she was in, but she didn’t have any idea. Furthermore, the puking princess could not tell the deputies where she staying nor where she lived.</p>\n<p>When asked how much alcohol she had consumed, she said five shots and told the officers she was feeling “drunk.” She did not know how she had caused her piercing to bleed, though the deputies suspected a tumble had caused the injury.</p>\n<p>Fearing that the nude Northridger would end up somewhere she would regret, the officers decided to arrest her for public intoxication. After collecting her clothing, the deputies transported the out-of-towner to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Taxi Cab Blues<br>\nSat., Jan. 31, 10:03 p.m. – Officers on 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were alerted to possible trouble by the sound of a car horn.</p>\n<p>Looking down the street, the deputies spotted a young man staggering down the center of the street, with a yellow taxi right on his heels. The taxi driver was unable to get around the sloppy stroller and, out of frustration, had reverted to repeated use of his horn.</p>\n<p>Despite the ruckus behind him, the inebriated 21-year old refused to step aside. When the officers approached and told the young man to get out of the street, he replied, “Well, you’re walking in the road.”</p>\n<p>The deputies, brushing the failed attempt at argument aside, escorted the man, and the girl that was with him, to the sidewalk. The officers then informed the drunken reveler of the dangers associated with walking down the middle of the street and told him to head straight home. His female counterpart, who the officers learned was his girlfriend, ensured the deputies he would do so and they walked off in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, less than a minute later an argument ensued and the officers watched as the childlike 21-year old pulled away from his girlfriend, shouting that he wasn’t going to go home.</p>\n<p>Having escaped the grasp of his woman, the young man fell right into the hands of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, who arrested him for public intoxication. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Wild Alaska<br>\nSun., Feb. 1, 2:05 a.m. – A young woman walking down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive – swaying as she went – caught the eye of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the clearly intoxicated female stumbled down the center of the street, cell phone in hand. The 19-year old then made for the sidewalk, but when she attempted to step up onto the curb, her foot got caught on the curb and she face-planted onto the cement. The deputies then watched as she sat up and promptly returned to her phone conversation.</p>\n<p>   The officers approached the sidewalk sitter and asked her if she knew where she was. She replied she was either in Las Vegas or Alaska, but could not decide which.</p>\n<p>Somewhat befuddled, the deputies asked if there was anyone she could call to come and get her, and the inebriated UCSB student was quick to dial a number. Explaining it was her brother, and that he would take care of her, she handed the phone to the officer, who introduced himself.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the line, the brother informed the officer that he could not come and get his sister since he was in his home state of Alaska.</p>\n<p>With no other option, the deputies arrested the severely misplaced women and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail. While in transit, however, the Las Vegas native vomited in the back seat of the car. Once out of the car, she fell over, hit her head, and temporarily lost consciousness.</p>\n<p>A nurse attended to the fallen reveler and determined she was too drunk to spend the night in jail and the young woman was subsequently transported to the hospital.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18233\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18233\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/","id":3846,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3845,3844,3843],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Bringing Down the House\n\nFri., Jan. 16, 11:56 p.m. - Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive witnessed two young men climb through the window into an abandoned house.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Bringing Down the House</p>\n<p>Fri., Jan. 16, 11:56 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive witnessed two young men climb through the window into an abandoned house.</p>\n<p>Once inside the house, the two inebriated men were overtaken by drunken douchebaggery. The deputies watched as they proceeded to destroy an assortment of objects in the house by throwing them to the ground.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached, the two troublemakers made for the backdoor and out into the backyard. While one of the males was able to get away, the second got tripped up and fell into the arms of the law.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the intoxicated man why he was in the abandoned house and he replied, “Physic, directed, mutant, genesis.” Confused, the officer asked a second time but the man just repeated himself, “Physic, directed, mutant, genesis.”</p>\n<p>Having taken note of his strange answer, the officer then asked the 23-year old to recite his alphabet. “A, B, C,” he started, “E, G, H, I, H, Z.”</p>\n<p>Feeling certain the man was too intoxicated to take care of himself, the officers arrested and transported him to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Station. While waiting for his paperwork to be completed, the man was placed on a chair in the station’s drunk tank. However, he was too drunk to sit in a chair properly, and, after a few minutes, he fell off the chair and landed on the side of his head, which caused a few small abrasions on his ear and cheek.</p>\n<p>The man was treated for his injuries and then taken to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Go Slugs!</p>\n<p>Sat., Jan 17, 3:08 a.m. – An intoxicated female nearly got run over by two officers driving their patrol car on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road early Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>The 19-year old woman was stumbling down the street with her head down and apparently did not see the approaching police car. Just as the car was about to pass, the inebriated stroller staggered to the side and directly in front of the squad car.</p>\n<p>The officers hit the brakes and backed up the vehicle to talk with the drunken UC Santa Cruz student. The deputies tried to ask the young lady about her condition but had trouble understanding her answers. It seemed to the deputy that the woman’s mouth was filled with something and he asked why. She told the officer she had “cottonmouth” and when asked why she said, “‘Cause there was so much to drink.”</p>\n<p>While she was able to correctly recite her alphabet, the drunken out-of-towner was otherwise at a total loss. She could not understand why she was talking with the police or why they were asking so many questions.</p>\n<p>Despite her confusion, the officers asked the woman, who weighed about 120 pounds, how much alcohol she had consumed. She replied, “Seven shots of vodka and five beers.” With ample evidence, the deputies arrested the Banana Slug for public intoxication and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending a good salting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/","id":3844,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3843,3842,3841],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Could You Help Me Zip Up?\nSat., Jan. 10, 1:02 a.m. - Deputies on a Friday night patrol watched as an inebriated young man stumbled through the front yard of 6662 Del Playa Dr., seemingly searching for...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Could You Help Me Zip Up?<br>\nSat., Jan. 10, 1:02 a.m. – Deputies on a Friday night patrol watched as an inebriated young man stumbled through the front yard of 6662 Del Playa Dr., seemingly searching for a place to relieve himself.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old man found a wall, unzipped and started to drunkenly write his name in urine on the bricks. The officer approached the man and stood behind him as he finished. Ten seconds later, the man was done peeing and face to face with Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The officer escorted him to the curb and asked for his name and date of birth. The piss-drunk pee-er told the officers his name was George Douglas McClaren – a fake – and that his date of birth was 9-21-88 – also fake.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, it didn’t take the officer long to determine he was being lied to and even less time to the arrest the dishonest urinator.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the drunken reveler was transported to the Isla Vista Station while the arrested deputy did the paperwork. A minute later, the dams burst open and Mr. McClaren vomited all over himself and the floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy placed him outside, where he continued to intermediately upchuck on himself. Then the 20-year-old sat motionless with his eyes closed and pissed himself.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Have You Seen My Wife?<br>\nFri., Jan. 2, 4:43 a.m. – Officers working the late shift received a report of two middle-aged men hiding in and shouting from the bushes in front of 6621 Abrego Rd.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, the deputies spotted the two men walking westbound down Abrego. The officers contacted the former bush-lovers, and one of them – a heavily intoxicated 58-year-old – immediately became argumentative and combative.</p>\n<p>Since his age was clearly not a concern, the deputies started by asking why the man was out walking around I.V. at 5 in the morning. His answer was frank, albeit completely untrue. He told the officers he had gotten into a fight with his wife earlier in the night and that she had kicked him out of the house.</p>\n<p>He went on to say that he had been trying to walk his intoxicated friend home when they fell into the bushes.</p>\n<p>A quick call to the Mrs., however, revealed a much different story. She told the officers that she and her husband no longer lived together and that he was currently residing in downtown Santa Barbara. The estranged wife added that her husband had also taken to sleeping in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park with the local transient population.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the officers had plenty to work with and arrested the twiggy man, transporting him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>You Guys Got a Light?<br>\nMon., Jan. 12, 1:49 a.m. – While on patrol, two officers spotted a man staggering down the middle of Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The two officers stood at the corner of Abrego and Camino Del Sur and watched as the man approached. The clearly inebriated man then proceeded to stumble into the middle of the intersection – with two cars fast approaching – and addressed the deputies.</p>\n<p>“You got a light for my cigarette?” he asked.</p>\n<p>The officers kindly asked the man to walk out of the street. The 31-year-old SBCC student refused, however, and shouted, “Fuck you guys,” at the officers.</p>\n<p>Even though the cops had ignored his request for a light, shouting profanities at the police – especially when drunk – is almost never a smart call. The officers walked over to the man, took him by the arm and escorted him to the sidewalk.

She drunkenly informed the officers she was going to a nearby sorority.</p>\n<p>Despite being unable to complete her ABCs, the deputies allowed the inebriated 18-year-old to go after instructing her to walk straight to the sorority with a man she indicated was her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>The officers then rode their bikes a block away and turned to watch the drunken sorority sister. Instead of walking toward her sorority, however, the young woman and her boy-toy – driven by the drunchies – headed straight for Freebirds.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the pair again and reminded the hungry girl of her instructions. After another failed alphabet test, the deputies let her go once more and continued to watch.</p>\n<p>The pair then walked toward campus and headed into the Pardall tunnel. The deputies stopped her for a third time and asked what she was doing. This time, she informed the officers that she was returning to her dorm room.</p>\n<p>The deputies explained that this was their third time talking with her and asked her how much she had imbibed. She responded by saying, “More than I should have.” At this point, the officers had no option but to arrest her, which they did.</p>\n<p>She was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>But I’m Just Drunk</p>\n<p>Fri., Nov. 21, 5:55 p.m. — A man was spotted stumbling down the sidewalk in front of Berrilicious, forcing Isla Vista’s finest into action.</p>\n<p>Deputies watched as the older male attempted to put one foot in front of the other without much success. On several occasions, the inebriated man lost his balance and nearly fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>The officers stopped the 43-year-old transient and immediately concluded he was exceedingly intoxicated.</p>\n<p>When the deputies attempted to question him, his words were so severely slurred that he could not be understood. After several failed attempts at human conversation, the day-drinking drunk finally admitting to drinking “a beer.” The officers concluded he was either an extreme lightweight, or he was lying about his consumption.</p>\n<p>Either way, a few minutes later he stated that all he had done was “get drunk” and could not understand why he was getting arrested. The officers calmly explained that public intoxication was a crime and subsequently arrested him. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Dare to D.A.R.E.</p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 22, 5:15 p.m. — An officer was on duty at UCSB’s Robertson Gym when he was informed that someone may have been jumping on the hood of a D.A.R.E. patrol car.</p>\n<p>As the deputy was walking out to the car, he noticed a middle-aged male moving away from the vehicle. He stopped the suspect and detained him.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the 36-year-old man what he was doing, but the individual said nothing at first. The deputy asked again, and the suspect said, “I was going to smash the D.A.R.E. vehicle.” He then went on to say, “I wanted to talk to Gregg Wilson so I could see my old swim records. They wouldn’t let me so I jumped on the D.A.R.E. car. I told them I was going to smash it.”</p>\n<p>When asked what the D.A.R.E. car had to do with Gregg Wilson, the seemingly sober man said, “I’m the named assistant swim coach for Gregg Wilson,” and offered no other reasoning.</p>\n<p>The deputy then inspected the car and noticed that the suspect had caused two small dents in the hood.</p>\n<p>The deputy placed the man under arrest and escorted him to his patrol car. Still not understanding, the officer asked once more why the man had jumped on the D.A.R.E. car. The swim-obsessed man replied that he was upset because he couldn’t see his old records. When asked again why jumping on the car had anything to do with seeing the swim records, he said, “I don’t know, I was upset.”</p>\n<p>The man was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending anger management.</p>\n<p>–Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17889\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17889\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/","id":3845,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3844,3843,3842],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Thurs., Oct 23, 5:50 a.m. — Custodial staff working an early morning shift at Ellison Hall on the UCSB campus called the police after coming across a young man asleep outside a door to the build...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Thurs., Oct 23, 5:50 a.m. — Custodial staff working an early morning shift at Ellison Hall on the UCSB campus called the police after coming across a young man asleep outside a door to the building.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista’s finest responded and found the inebriated subject lying upside-down on a handicap ramp. The deputies roused the man from his drunken stupor and assisted him to his feet.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the sidewalk sleeper if he knew where he was and he told them he was in front of Manzanita Village. A deputy directed his attention to the large academic building behind him and again asked the man to describe his surroundings, but the 19-year-old adamantly assured the deputies they were at Manzanita Village and that the offices in Ellison were in fact dorm rooms.</p>\n<p>The severely confused individual then told officers that he lived on Camino Pescadero, that it was just a short walk from Manzanita and that they should just let him walk home. Officers told him he was not close to Camino Pescadero and, despite assuring officers he was, asked if he could call his roommate to walk him home.</p>\n<p>The deputies said he could and he proceeded to reach for his phone. His phone, however, was not there and the still intoxicated man became confused and looked to the officer to ask if he had his cell phone.</p>\n<p>The deputy told him he did not have his cell phone, and instead arrested the young man for public intoxication. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Mon., Oct 27, 4:11 a.m. — At approximately 4:01 a.m., deputies received a report of an intoxicated man trying to gain entry into a house on the 6700 block of Pasado Road.</p>\n<p>The concerned residents told dispatch that the man had begun by repeatedly slamming his body into their sliding glass door, and when that proved ineffective, had moved around to the front door and was banging incessantly trying to gain entry.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived 10 minutes later, they witnessed the heavy set 28-year-old man square up to the front door, push himself forward and, with considerable force, slam the entirety of his excessive weight against the wooden door.</p>\n<p>Despite the man’s sincerest and drunkest efforts, however, the door did not budge.</p>\n<p>The deputies contacted the man and told him to stop throwing himself at the door, which he did. The officers then asked the man — who, incidentally, works for KjEE FM in Santa Barbara — why he was trying to get inside in the residence.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the heavily intoxicated male did not have an answer to this question. In fact, he could not say where he was, how he had come to be in Isla Vista to begin with, or whose house he was attempting to enter.</p>\n<p>All he could say for sure was that he had consumed between five and eight beers that night.</p>\n<p>That was enough for the deputies, though, who arrested the man for public intoxication and allowed him unobstructed entrance into the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>— Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/","id":3889,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3888,3887,3886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat., Oct. 11, 1:17 a.m. -- An officer on a uniformed foot patrol of the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive spotted a heavily intoxicated female being assisted by a male companion.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When the Vomit Hits the Fan</p>\n<p>Sat., Oct. 11, 1:17 a.m. — An officer on a uniformed foot patrol of the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive spotted a heavily intoxicated female being assisted by a male companion.</p>\n<p>Judging that the young woman was unable to walk on her own, the deputy stopped the pair and asked to talk with the inebriated woman. Her escort agreed and quickly left the scene.</p>\n<p>Without the help of her supposed friend, the 18-year-old out-of-towner was unable to maintain her balance and started to dry heave.</p>\n<p>Before the officer could assist the unsteady gal, she began to dry heave so violently that she fell to the ground. Once on the pavement, her dry heaving turned to actual vomiting and the shit hit the fan; she threw up in her hair, on her clothes and all over her legs and feet.</p>\n<p>After she was done upchucking her dinner, lunch and breakfast, the deputy asked her how much she had to drink that night, and she replied with, “I’m good.” Then she told the officer that she was having trouble seeing things.</p>\n<p>After five minutes of sitting on the curb, the officer asked if she could walk.

She had another female with her, but she was not assisting the inebriated.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the 19-year-old woman, and immediately picked up on the strong odor of alcohol coming from her person.</p>\n<p>They asked the young woman where she was coming from and she replied that she had just left her sorority. She was then asked where she was heading, and she replied her sorority.</p>\n<p>When asked how much she had had to drink, she said, “Enough.” After speaking with her friend, the officers learned that they had come from the Phi Sig fraternity house, where the various sororities had been competing in a “gladiator style” sporting event.</p>\n<p>She was arrested and transported to the Isla Vista sub-station on Trigo Road. There she was placed on a chair in the holding cell, but after a half-hour of repeatedly falling off she was moved to the floor.</p>\n<p>Her intoxication seemed to be increasing, and at times she lost consciousness. Then, she began to urinate, soaking her shorts and the ground that she was sitting on. She made no attempt to move and ultimately passed out in a puddle of her own urine.</p>\n<p>The sorority girl was then transported to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for alcohol overdose, but was ultimately released back to the Sheriff’s Dept. and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>–Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/","id":3888,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3887,3886,3885],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Friday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. - A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Watch Your Step</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. – A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling officer.</p>\n<p>The deputy went to check on the well-being of the 19-year-old and immediately noticed the strong odor of alcohol emanating from his person. The not-so-sure-footed partier had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, and his clothes were soiled in what appeared to be his own bodily fluids.</p>\n<p>As the deputy spoke with the now-seated man, he began to vomit vigorously. After he was done regurgitating his dinner, he slumped over to the side, almost landed in his own pile of vomit, and fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>The officer awoke the sickly man and continued questioning him, making sure not to step in the puddle of sick.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the man what he had been drinking, and not surprisingly, the young man stated, “Tequila.”</p>\n<p>Having heard all he needed to hear, the officer arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Marking Your Territory</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:20 p.m. – Officers poking around a Del Playa parking lot came across a young man defacing a stranger’s vehicle.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the 19-year-old UCSB student pulled down his zipper, whipped it out and began urinating on the side of a minivan. He was, however, too drunk to keep his balance and had to use the minivan for support as he relieved himself.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even with the van’s steady support, standing tall was just too difficult and the perp stumbled to the side and started peeing on his own leg.</p>\n<p>An officer walked up behind the man and told him to “zip it up.” Caught red-handed, the young man turned around and still tried to play it cool, telling the officer he hadn’t been urinating.</p>\n<p>His zipper was still down, however, and the officer told him once more to zip it up, which he eventually did. The deputy then began to question the young man, but he proved to be uncooperative.</p>\n<p>Judging that the man was unable to care for himself, the officer arrested the young pisser and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Deaf, Dumb and Blind</b><br>\nSat. Sept. 20, 12:14 a.m. – An SBCC student walking west down Del Playa Drive caught the attention of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>Acting as if he were a human pinball and Del Playa was his alcohol-themed pinball machine, the 20-year-old man was bumping into people left and right as he attempted to navigate the busy street. He had with him a female escort, but not even a pinball wizard could have controlled his reckless walking.</p>\n<p>Then the unsteady stroller bumped into the wrong man, who got up in his face and started shouting. The deputies hastened towards the intoxicated man, hoping to get to him before he got himself into real trouble.</p>\n<p>The officers reached the young man and told him to sit down on the curb, which he did, and started asking him for his information. Due to his level of intoxication, however, he proved difficult to talk to. His speech was so slurred the deputy had to ask him to repeat answers several times before he could comprehend what he was trying to saying.</p>\n<p>He told the officers he had been drinking at a friend’s house and was heading to another friend’s house. Isla Vista’s Finest were forced to disagree, however, and arrested the man right there.
