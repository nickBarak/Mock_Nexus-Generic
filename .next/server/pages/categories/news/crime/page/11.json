Not surprisingly, the 19-year-old possessed many of the symptoms of heavy intoxication.</p>\n<p>The deputy, relatively unscathed from his run-in with the bike, immediately told the reckless rider to park it on the curb, but the young man would not. After several attempts at ordering him to sit down, the officer had to physically assist him to the curb.</p>\n<p>After finally succeeding in seating the BMX bomber, the deputy was able to assess the situation. He first noticed that the young man was not wearing a shoe on his right foot, a sign of having too much to drink.</p>\n<p>The young man told the officer he had taken three shots earlier in the night, but after failing to complete his ABC’s, he was arrested for public intoxication. In response, the recently arrested cyclist repeatedly told the deputy that he had just been trying to get home and that everything was an “accident.”</p>\n<p>Accident or not, crashing into a police officer while riding a bike is never going to turn out well, and in this case the young man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Where Did You Sleep Last Night?<br>\nSun., Sept. 7, 6:47 a.m.-Deputies working the morning shift received a call concerning a young man passed out on a sidewalk near the intersection of Camino Pescadero and El Greco roads.</p>\n<p>Two officers responded to the call and immediately found the 18-year-old sleeping peacefully on the concrete. He was fully dressed, but the fresh morning light revealed that his t-shirt was covered in what appeared to be his own vomit.</p>\n<p>One of the deputies walked up to the sidewalk sleeper and said, “Police, wake up,” in a low, police-like voice, but the sleeping beauty did not rouse. However, after a little shaking, the young man eventually sat up.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the severely confused man if he knew where he was, but he simply looked up at the deputy with a blank stare on his face.</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked if he knew where he lived, and he responded by saying he lived on “DP.” When asked where on Del Playa, he just shrugged his shoulders and did not respond.</p>\n<p>The SBCC student was then asked if he had too much to drink the night before and he, as anyone who wakes up on a sidewalk should, nodded his head in agreement.</p>\n<p>“Would you like to go to jail?” asked the deputy, and the young man once again nodded his head in agreement. Not wishing to disappoint, the officer arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Breaking and Entering (and Sleeping?)<br>\nMon., Sept. 15, 5:14 a.m.-A deputy was dispatched to 6661 Berkshire Terrace on a report of an intoxicated male trying to unlawfully gain entry into an apartment.</p>\n<p>When the officer arrived he contacted a resident of the apartment, who said that she had been sleeping on the living room couch when an unidentified male climbed through the front window and “passed out” on the floor. When asked if she knew the squatter, she said “no” and that she wanted him gone.</p>\n<p>The deputy walked into the apartment and saw the 21-year-old UCSB student fast asleep on the living room floor. He had on a collared shirt, a pair of underwear and nothing else. His pants were soaking wet with what no doubt was his own urine, and his shoes were laying haphazardly on the kitchen floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy shook the young man awake, but he was too disoriented to cooperate. He did not know where he was, or where he lived. When he tried to stand, he nearly fell over.</p>\n<p>The officer told the floor moocher that he was not welcome there, and the confused man walked to his pants and attempted to put the urine soaked denim back on, but was unable to and instead placed them back down on the floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy again told him that he was not wanted, but the piss-soaked sleeper mumbled something incoherent and continued to walk aimlessly around the living room.</p>\n<p>Clearly incapable of taking care of himself, he was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>-Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/","id":3886,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3885,3884,3883],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-08-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Loitering in the Streets with Demons Sun., Aug. 2, 2:47 a.m. — Officers working the late shift received a call concerning a man loitering at the 7-Eleven convenience store on Hollister Avenue.

The man was quick to answer: “God,” he told the officer.</p>\n<p>Unfazed, the officer asked what the man was doing. “Purples fives in my eyes,” he replied.</p>\n<p>The psychedelic poet continued, uttering more strange answers when questioned. When asked his address, he mentioned a “Thermo Nuclear Device” and at one point began speaking in numbers.</p>\n<p>And when he wasn’t articulating the outlandish and bizarre, he would stand with his eyes closed and refuse to answer any questions.</p>\n<p>The officer could not detect the presence of alcohol, but judging from his weird behavior, arrested the 35-year old man for public intoxication of a controlled substance and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Angels in the Bike Rack</b><br>\n<i>Tues., July 29, 9:44 a.m. —</i> Officers on a patrol down Embarcadero Del Norte came across a young woman passed out between a pair of bikes parked in front of Freebirds.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the sidewalk sleeper and observed that she had soiled her pants and had what appeared to be dried spit and leftover food on her chin.</p>\n<p>When the officers awoke the weeknight reveler, she was extremely disoriented. She could not remember her own name and told the deputies she was at her home in Agoura Hills, Calif., some 70 miles from Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the officer was skeptical of her story, she added that she was “walking home” to Agoura Hills with her friend. When asked what friend she was walking with, the 23-year-old woman pointed towards the sky and said “him.”</p>\n<p>However, the deputy knew that not even holy providence could have steered the drunk woman home that night. Instead, he arrested and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Doggie Heaven or Just the Dog House?</b><br>\n<i>Sun., July 20, 2:43 a.m. —</i> Residents of 6744 Sabado Tarde Rd. contacted the Isla Vista Foot Patrol to report an unknown female wandering around their front yard, barefoot.</p>\n<p>When the deputies contacted the 22-year-old woman, she was unable to speak coherently or provide answers to simple questions such as her name or address.</p>\n<p>Additionally, her face was covered in what appeared to be mud, and when the officers stood a little closer, they were overwhelmed by the familiar smell of vomit and alcohol.</p>\n<p>When asked why she was in a stranger’s yard, she informed the deputies that she was trying to locate her missing dog. There was one slight problem with her story, however: Her dog lived with her parents in the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>The officer decided to let the dog story slide, and again asked the young woman where she lived. She began uttering numbers, but the deputy eventually discovered she was simply reciting a phone number.</p>\n<p>Hoping for at least one legitimate answer, the officer then asked the barefoot, mud-covered, vomit-reeking loiterer for her phone number, but she replied by repeatedly saying her last name.</p>\n<p>Clearly unable to care for herself, the officer arrested the severely confused woman, and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/","id":3885,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3884,3883,3882],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Blazing Saddles Mon., May 26, 12:03 a.m. – Deputies in a marked police car came across a truck parked in a fire lane on Seville Road.

Unable to conduct a stop due to traffic, the deputies followed the vehicle, which eventually made a right onto El Colegio Road and then a left onto Stadium Road.</p>\n<p>As the truck turned onto Stadium Road, the driver crossed the double yellow lines, prompting the deputies to pull him over.</p>\n<p>While standing at the driver’s side window, the officer immediately detected the pungent odor of burnt marijuana emanating from within the truck. The deputy asked if there was any pot in the car and the driver admitted that he and his passengers had hot-boxed the truck earlier that evening. He then assured the officer there wasn’t anymore weed – or at least he couldn’t remember there being anymore.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old male then produced a brightly colored pipe, complete with burnt residue. The driver told the deputies the piece belonged to his passenger, however the man riding shotgun was unable to produce a valid medical marijuana card.</p>\n<p>The driver was then asked to step out of the truck while an officer checked the vehicle for any hidden drugs. Unfortunately for this stoner, the floor beneath the passenger seat just wasn’t a good hiding spot and, after a short search, the deputy produced a small baggie containing less than an ounce of weed.</p>\n<p>The red-eyed Rasta was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of a controlled substance and was required to pee into a cup. He was later released into the care of his sober passenger, pending a later court date.</p>\n<p>Brown-Bagging It<br>\nTues., May 27, 4:28 p.m. – Officers on an afternoon patrol received a complaint of an intoxicated subject disturbing pedestrians in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, deputies spotted a 47-year-old male staggering about the park, yelling at an innocent bystander. As if his actions – and his breath – weren’t tips enough, the belligerent day-drinker was also toting a 40-shaped brown paper bag.</p>\n<p>The officer told the man to take a seat, but before obliging, the drunkard poured out his beer and tossed the bottle behind him. Dutifully, the deputy went to fetch the litter.</p>\n<p>The officer placed the bottle back in front of the elderly drunk, only to have him pick it up and throw it once more.</p>\n<p>Deciding it was best to just leave the bottle as is, the deputy asked the man – whose eyes were bloodshot and watering – how much alcohol he had consumed. The man yelled back, “I don’t care. Take me to jail.”</p>\n<p>The deputy didn’t have to be told twice. He arrested the man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/","id":3872,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3871,3870,3869],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., May 18, 12:05 a.m. - Officers on a routine patrol down El Embarcadero spotted a rather young-looking male pestering passersby as he moved down the street.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Mama Always Said…<br>\nSun., May 18, 12:05 a.m. – Officers on a routine patrol down El Embarcadero spotted a rather young-looking male pestering passersby as he moved down the street.</p>\n<p>The young man was rudely using both middle fingers to flip off those who passed, as if one “fuck you” wasn’t enough for the citizens of Isla Vista. Despite his slight build and young face, he seemed to be highly confrontational and looked to be itching for a fight.</p>\n<p>Before he could find that perfect someone, though, he ran into I.V.’s finest. The officers asked the pugnacious punk his age and he truthfully replied that he was 15.</p>\n<p>The officers saw that the 15-year old kid, who was in town visiting his brother, was carrying a backpack and asked him what was in it. He told them, “It’s just water in there. You can search it if you want.”</p>\n<p>The officers, not wanting to refuse an invitation, opened the bag and found an open, nearly empty fifth of Taaka Vodka.</p>\n<p>Upon seeing the deputy remove the alcohol from his backpack, the young gun quickly retorted, saying “Hey! How’d that get in my backpack? I was only carrying water. They must have put that vodka in there.”</p>\n<p>Not caring to get to the bottom of this case, the officers cited the young whippersnapper with a minor in possession, as well as being out past curfew, and released him to his brother, pending harsher punishment from his mother.</p>\n<p>Shrubbery Showdown<br>\nFri., May 16, 12:18 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Pasado Road witnessed a man ungracefully weaving in and out of foot traffic.</p>\n<p>So intoxicated was the young man that many of his fellow Friday night revelers stopped and watched him as he attempted to walk down the street.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he also drew the gaze of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, who stopped the unsteady stroller.</p>\n<p>A deputy advised the 18-year-old male that he was very intoxicated and told the tipsy trotter that he wanted a word with him. The intoxicated male attempted to say something in return, but his words were completely incoherent.</p>\n<p>The officer sat the tongue-tied man on the curb, but he immediately fell backwards into a rather large bush. Sitting back up, the drunkard attempted to say his name but once again could not be understood.</p>\n<p>Fearing words wouldn’t get them any farther, the deputy asked if the man had ID. The drunk managed to answer “no.”</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked the man if he could walk home, and received a “yes” in return. Yet when he attempted to stand up, gravity won the battle and the drunk found himself back in the bushes – and into a pair of handcuffs.</p>\n<p>While awaiting his trip to the jail at the IVFP substation, the man had more issues sitting, this time mistaking a trashcan for a chair. Luckily he was too drunk to be embarrassed, and was eventually transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Two Cups, One Hangover<br>\nSat., May 17, 5:19 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to the 6500 block of Cordoba Road on reports of a subject trying to gain entrance to an apartment complex.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived on the scene a few minutes later and went around to the back of the apartment complex, where they found the 19-year-old perpetrator hunched over a large puddle of his own vomit.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the defeated reveler where he was and he answered by saying his last name aloud. His answer was the same when asked where he was from.</p>\n<p>Hoping for a different answer, the deputies asked him where he was once more, and he incorrectly told them “Del Playa.” Not a bad guess, they conceded.</p>\n<p>Next on the list of questions was his date of birth, which the drunkard told the officers was “six, six.” The deputy then asked how much alcohol he had consumed and he said, “two cups.”</p>\n<p>Comfortable with their decision, the officers arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16908\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16908\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/","id":3752,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3751,3750,3749],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Mon., May 5, 1:51 a.m. - Deputies on uniformed patrol were dispatched to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road to apprehend a man who was reported thrice that night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Three Strikes You’re Out<br>\nMon., May 5, 1:51 a.m. – Deputies on uniformed patrol were dispatched to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road to apprehend a man who was reported thrice that night.</p>\n<p>The officers were told that the man in question was incessantly banging on the door of his friend’s apartment, asking to speak with the friend about his own girlfriend.</p>\n<p>This was, however, not the first time the police were called with regards to the suspect’s obsessive desire to talk with or about his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>The 21-year-old’s friend had first called the police after the seemingly drunk man had scaled a wooden fence and started pounding on the sliding glass door of the apartment. By the time the officers had arrived, he had disappeared.</p>\n<p>The friend told the deputies he had allowed the man inside the apartment but that, once inside, his drunken friend started to verbally abuse his girlfriend and needed to be kicked out. It was at this point that he jumped the fence and started his assault on the sliding glass door.</p>\n<p>After avoiding the police, the man resumed his quest at the front door, prompting his friend to call the police a second time. When the deputies arrived, they heard the desperate man shouting, “Come on, man. I’m going to jail. Let me in!”</p>\n<p>The officers told the man to wait until he was sober to talk to his girlfriend and that he should go straight home, lest he be arrested for public intoxication. He agreed, telling the deputies that he would not be a problem anymore.</p>\n<p>Thinking he had given the Isla Vista Foot Patrol the slip, he returned a few minutes later to bang on the door a third time.

Unabashed, he continued on, but soon lost his balance again and fell into the next available parked car.</p>\n<p>The officers stopped the unsteady stroller, who could barely stand still without completely losing his poise.</p>\n<p>The deputies began to question him, but soon realized that along with his balance, the man had lost his ability to comprehend what was happening. He stood there with a blank expression on his face and was unable to focus on the deputy when addressed.</p>\n<p>The officer asked oblivious man where he had been headed, but when he tried to answer, his speech was nothing but a stream of incoherent ramblings. His words were horribly slurred and he could barely put together a sentence.</p>\n<p>The officers, convinced the confused wanderer was unable to get home safely, arrested him. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Marathon<br>\nSun., May 4, 2:20 p.m. – Officers taking a break in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Station on Pardall Road were interrupted by the loud remarks of two passersby.</p>\n<p>A 19-year old male and his friend walking eastbound down Pardall Road decided to tempt fate by loudly making snide remarks about Isla Vista’s finest as they passed the open door of the police station. Only, this pair of day drinkers made one glaringly obvious mistake: One of them had decided to drunkenly taunt the police with a red cup in his hand.</p>\n<p>The deputies, however, opted not to stop the pair and let them continue on their way, red cup and all.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for them, these two Sunday partiers apparently hadn’t gotten enough thrills on their first pass, because 20 minutes later they returned walking in the opposite direction – the red cup still firmly in hand.</p>\n<p>If the deputies still had reservations about stopping the two, they were wiped away when they heard their now incoherent remarks drift in through the open door.</p>\n<p>An officer stopped the cup-wielding man and asked him what it contained. The defeated daredevil confessed that he was carrying vodka and that he was only 19 years of age.</p>\n<p>When asked when he had begun his daytime drinking, the man proudly stated that he had been continuously drinking since the night before.</p>\n<p>Apparently unimpressed, the deputy arrested the man and had him transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/","id":3874,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3873,3872,3871],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Steak, Guacamole and a Deadly Weapon, Please Saturday, Feb. 23, 4:33 a.m. — Officers stationed at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office received an early-morning call concerning a man “passed ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Steak, Guacamole and a Deadly Weapon, Please<br>\nSaturday, Feb. 23, 4:33 a.m. — Officers stationed at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office received an early-morning call concerning a man “passed out drunk” in front of Freebirds.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived minutes later, the 19-year-old man was laying on the sidewalk in front of the door, vomiting.</p>\n<p>Apparently unable to keep down his drunchies, the man was also unable to tell his story.</p>\n<p>According to a witness, the man laying in a pool of his previous meal — queso-nacho-rito, anyone? — had walked into the popular burrito joint earlier carrying an open pocket knife.</p>\n<p>The man with the munchies did not threaten anyone with the knife — perhaps plastic knives just weren’t good enough for him — but, nonetheless, the witness had quickly taken the knife from the drunk.</p>\n<p>The deputies, determining that the man was too drunk even for Freebirds, called the paramedics, who transported the man to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Cross-fading the Night Away<br>\nSaturday, Feb. 23, 1:40 a.m. — Deputies patrolling the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road noticed a man having some difficulty putting one foot in front of the other sauntering down the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Officers continued to watch the man as he staggered from side to side. Judging from his apparent lack of balance, the deputies suspected the man was under the influence of a solid amount of alcohol. The fact that he was yelling at innocent passersby also helped the officers in the deduction.</p>\n<p>However, the 18-year-old man was not satisfied with his simple inebriation. Seemingly unaware of the deputies standing just paces away, the man asked aloud, “Do you know where I could score some weed?”</p>\n<p>Before he could ever get his answer, the pot-seeking soon-to-be-prisoner crossed paths with the police.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this drunken reveler did not spend the night blissfully forgetting where he put his belongings — deputies working the night shift at the Santa Barbara County Jail took care of that for him.</p>\n<p>My Name Is…<br>\nSunday, Feb. 24, 12:18 a.m. — Two males leaning against each other for support caught the attention of deputies patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>Officers spotted the 23-year-old man leaning head first against the outstretched arm of his comrade. The two, like drunken statues backlit by I.V.’s relentless debauchery, held this graceful posture for some time.</p>\n<p>But beauty is not meant to last and the two broke away and headed directly toward the officers, at which point the true extent of their intoxication came into clear focus.</p>\n<p>The deputies determined that the 23-year-old male was unable to care for himself and asked the man his name. He answered with his first name, but gave no hint of his surname.</p>\n<p>The deputies asked again several times, but the man simply smiled and shook his head, offering no answers. The officers asked him his date of birth and if he knew where he was, but with smiles abounding, he gave no answer.</p>\n<p>The deputies then asked if the man had his driver license, at which point he reached into his back pocket and produced his wallet.</p>\n<p>Yet, with his wallet out, the happy drunk was unable to find his license, even though it was clearly visible. The officer generously pointed it out to him, yet he was still unable to retrieve it.</p>\n<p>A smile goes a long way, however, and the deputies were kind enough to help the man out and retrieved his license for him.</p>\n<p>With the government-issued cheat sheet in hand, the severely confused man was still unable to provide officers with neither his last name nor his date of birth.</p>\n<p>The man was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending remembrance of his name.<br>\n— Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15994\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15994\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/","id":3875,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3874,3873,3872],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A-B-C, Easy as 1-2-3?\nSaturday, Jan. 12, 12:29 a.m. - On Embarcadero del Norte, a group of men yelling at each other attracted the attention of a large crowd, and, eventually, the Isla Vista Foot Patr...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A-B-C, Easy as 1-2-3?<br>\nSaturday, Jan. 12, 12:29 a.m. – On Embarcadero del Norte, a group of men yelling at each other attracted the attention of a large crowd, and, eventually, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>The officers spotted a 23-year-old man who had actually had a run-in with I.V.’s finest earlier that night. The reason: an inappropriate tirade of deafening insults.</p>\n<p>The man – who seemed to have his vocal dial turned up to 11 – told the deputies that he just wanted to go home, all the while trying to dip, duck and dodge the questions thrown his way.</p>\n<p>He managed to count how many shots he’d had that night – eight- but could not seem to remember his alphabet for the officers.</p>\n<p>After several earnest attempts, trying such letter combinations as the commonly mistaken “K-I-Z” and the just barely incorrect “U-P,” he admitted to the officers, “No, I cannot say my ABCs.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication, and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending successful completion of his 1-2-3s.</p>\n<p>She’s a Lady<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 1:21 a.m. – After receiving a call from residents on Camino del Sur that a woman was face down on the grass throwing up, an IVFP officer found the19-year-old.</p>\n<p>When the deputy approached the woman, she managed to compose herself enough to speak, and, as the officer noted, was exceedingly polite.</p>\n<p>Despite her good manners, the woman proved a bit untrustworthy. She told the officer that she had gone to a party with her friends, but that like all underage students at UCSB, she only drank water.</p>\n<p>The woman, who had soiled her jeans, repeatedly denied drinking any alcohol. Her story, however, proved about as watertight as a pasta strainer when a test administrated by the deputies showed her blood alcohol content level at .212.</p>\n<p>Once the woman realized she was caught in a lie, she apologized profusely for causing trouble and gracefully faced her night in jail, wet pants and all.</p>\n<p>Close Encounters of the Leafy Kind<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 12:52 a.m. – Officers patrolling Sabado Tarde Road saw a woman stumble down the street, lose her balance and run straight into a bush.</p>\n<p>Refusing to let a mere shrub get the best of her, the 19-year-old woman recovered, brushed away the stray twigs from her hair, and continued down the street.</p>\n<p>When confronted by the deputies, the woman said she was coming from a party on Sueno Road and that all she had to drink was a beer and a shot.</p>\n<p>The officer questioned the validity of her alcohol consumption, and asked the woman if she had any more to drink. She told him, “No, I really did not. I am just a lightweight.”</p>\n<p>When informed of her encounter with the foliage, the woman said she did not remember running into the bush, but reassured the officers that she had talked to many people that night.</p>\n<p>The officers – still on Sabado – asked the woman if she was aware of her surroundings. The woman told the deputies she was on El Nido Lane coming from Cordoba Road – negating both reality and what she had earlier told the officers.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and taken to the IVFP station.

Quickly, the bloodshot eyes and strong odor of alcohol led the officer to suspect a high level of intoxication. Also, she was not wearing shoes. The officer kindly asked the woman to sit on the curb until he finished his prior engagement with the unfortunate driver.</p>\n<p>Having let the vehicle go, he turned to the woman and asked what she needed. The woman, apparently following George Washington’s famed maxim, replied, “I’m drunk, I’m not going to lie.” When asked just how much she had drunk, the woman continued to show her truthful side, confessing, “[A] lot.”</p>\n<p>“I drink too much,” she added.</p>\n<p>When asked to stand up, her bare feet were unable to provide the necessary balance and the officer decided to arrest her.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>See Spot Drink…</p>\n<p>Saturday, Dec. 29, 2:00 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 700 block of Camino del Sur happened across a woman screaming and waving her arm in the air with a man behind her holding on to her shoulder.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached in their patrol car, the male subject left the agitated woman behind and proceeded to walk in the opposite direction at a brisk pace, looking back once to check out the situation.</p>\n<p>The officer, fearing the man would flee, sprung to action, jumping out of the car while yelling at him to come back. He did, albeit not as briskly as before.</p>\n<p>The officer started slapping handcuffs onto the subject, suspecting a possible assault. Suddenly the officer noticed that the man’s arrest was angering the woman. “You’re fucking arresting him?” she screamed out in a slurred and incoherent voice.</p>\n<p>The officer turned his attention to the 19-year-old woman, who he quickly determined was heavily intoxicated. Further questioning revealed the underling reason for her highly agitated state. Ignoring all the officer’s questions, the woman instead asked him, “Is my dog hurt?”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the drunken canine lover’s responses continued to involve her dog, despite the absence of any furry friends within the area.</p>\n<p>Further inquiry into the subject revealed that the 21-year-old man was a co-worker of hers who had simply offered to walk his friend home. The alcohol, however, had apparently blacked out any concrete memory of where she lived and the two wandered up and down the entire length of Camino del Sur for nearly an hour before they stumbled upon Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she spent the night in the doghouse, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Transporter<br>\nTuesday, Jan. 1, 12:35 a.m. – Choosing to roost between a hard place and a bush, a 20-year-old female woke up for the first time in 2008 to the glare of a Foot Patrol flashlight.</p>\n<p>Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive came across a woman wedged between a tall bush and a parked truck, seemingly asleep yet still standing. Her belt was half off and she seemed to have lost her shoes.</p>\n<p>When approached by deputies, the motionless woman mumbled, “I’m not driving them home.” When asked what she was doing, she repeated, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>Officers informed her that her sleep aid – the truck next to her – was empty, and no one else was present. The distinct lack of anyone to drive did not quell her concern, however. When asked why her belt was half off, she announced, much to officers’ surprise, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the woman to step out from between the truck and the bush and onto the sidewalk. Balance, however, was not the would-be-driver’s forte, and she stumbled and fell into the officer’s arms.</p>\n<p>The sleepy souse had a few fresh scratches on her arm, but was unable to explain their presence to the officer, apparently forgetting her recent stint in a bush.</p>\n<p>The women was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/","id":3871,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3870,3869,3868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat, Nov. 3, 12:49 a.m. - Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed a man staggering down the street.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Sat, Nov. 3, 12:49 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed a man staggering down the street.</p>\n<p>The man lost his balance several times, falling to the ground, before standing up and trying again.</p>\n<p>As a deputy observed the man, he saw that the subject was about to fall and kindly ran to catch him.

The deputy announced his presence and tapped the subject on shoulder three times before he spoke.</p>\n<p>Without looking at him, the man, who attends the University of Southern California, acknowledged the officer with a nod.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked the troubled Trojan if he was OK the man said, “yes,” and that he was just sleeping.</p>\n<p>When asked how much he had to drink, the wounded warrior admitted, “Quite a bit.”</p>\n<p>Forgetting to take a page from history, the man apparently got too drunk while surrounded by his enemies.</p>\n<p>The man said he thought he was in Los Angeles and did not even know how he got drunk.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked the man where his friends were, the man did not reply and instead vomited for several minutes on his hands and feet.</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was kept behind the fortress walls until he learned his lesson.</p>\n<p>Never Yell Your Phone Number to Strangers<br>\nSunday, Oct. 21, 2:41 a.m. – A woman was stumbling down the 6500 block of Seville Road, held up by an unknown man.</p>\n<p>An officer contacted the pair and asked the woman where she lived. The subject pointed and said, “Right there at 66 Seville.”</p>\n<p>The deputy duly noted that no such address exists in I.V., and decided to continue questioning the 19-year-old woman.</p>\n<p>When he asked the subject if she knew her companion, who was also intoxicated, she said she only knew his first name. The woman then apparently forgot how to pronounce her new friend’s name.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked her how much she had drank, the subject replied, “I don’t know… but it was a lot.”</p>\n<p>The woman was taken to I.V. Foot Patrol office, where the deputy continued questioning her. The woman repeatedly said that her phone number was “714-c-h-a-y.”</p>\n<p>She immediately fell asleep after questioning.</p>\n<p>The woman was woken up and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/","id":3863,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[3862,3861,3860],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem...

I’m fine. I’ve had four shots, but I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>When the officer managed to get a word in edgewise, he asked the subject where she lived and the 20-year-old woman replied, “I live a lot of places.”</p>\n<p>In his report, the officer noted as evidence of the subject’s extreme intoxication that her tan dress was disheveled and her top was open, nearly exposing her breasts.</p>\n<p>Evidently, the reporting deputy did not understand the Isla Vista Halloween dress code.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Out of Her League<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 27, 11:04 p.m. – On the 6700 block of Trigo Road, a deputy observed a woman wearing a Washington Wizards jersey charge into a group of people and lose her balance.</p>\n<p>The woman, apparently incised over the foul, turned around and yelled at the group and continued traveling down the lane.</p>\n<p>That is, until an Isla Vista referee stopped her in her tracks. Noticing a strong odor of alcohol, an officer stopped the woman and took her out of the game.</p>\n<p>The deputy sat the woman on the curb and began questioning her, only to learn that she was 17 years old.</p>\n<p>The officer informed the player that she was too young to drink alcohol, to which she countered, “Yeah, but it is Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>The rules of the game are the same everywhere, and the deputy said he thought the Wizard had too much to drink. The subject shot back, “Yeah, but so has everyone else.”</p>\n<p>This defense did not work, and the officer asked if the woman had any friends who could help her home. The subject said she drove to I.V. with her sister, but when the officers asked where her teammate was, the woman said, “I don’t know, she walked away from me.”</p>\n<p>This was then game over for the underage Wizard, who was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>I’m the Baby… Gotta Love Me<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 27, 11:28 p.m. –  Officers watched a 300 pound wearing a diaper with a pacifier in his mouth being  escorted down Camino Corto by a friend.</p>\n<p>An officer who observed the man noted that he was filthy and said it appeared that the big baby had fallen into a pile of dirt and rolled around in it.</p>\n<p>After watching the man stumble away from his friend and bounce into a parked car, a deputy stopped the duo and began questioning the 19-year-old man.</p>\n<p>The troubled toddler started whining to the deputies, repeating that he was not drunk, despite his inability to stand on his own, which the officers decided not to attribute to his infantile alter ego.</p>\n<p>The man had no identification and no money for a cab to transport him to his home downtown. The man would not tell officers how old he was  and refused to hold up the appropriate number of fingers.

He had to catch the man and force him to sit on the curb just to keep him from toppling over.</p>\n<p>During questioning, the man provided the deputy with several different partial addresses before admitting, “[I] have already been arrested so many times [I don’t] even care anymore.”</p>\n<p>As such, this made things easier for the officer, who then arrested the man for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>An Officer and a Gentleman</p>\n<p>Sunday, Oct. 21, 12:58 a.m. – An officer patrolling Camino Del Sur stopped a group of three women.

The deputy told him that he himself was “a proud graduate of SBCC” and then asked the subject to repeat his ABC’s.</p>\n<p>The man did not seem to know the alphabet but happily repeated, “I’m from SBCC. I am a proud graduate.”</p>\n<p>He then told officers he lived at “R690” on “I.V.

Thankfully, it remained unbroken.</p>\n<p>The man’s lucky streak ended there, though, as the officer picked up and dumped out the tequila.</p>\n<p>The subject explained to the officer, “It’s okay for me to be drunk. I’m over 21.”</p>\n<p>Despite his age, the man was breaking two laws – possession of an open container of alcohol and obvious public intoxication – so the officer arrested him.</p>\n<p>While at the IVFP station waiting for transfer to jail, the man alternated between lying on the floor and sitting in the chair, apparently trying to find the most comfortable position.</p>\n<p>Soon the man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>I Would Walk 500 Miles… But Not with Her<br>\nThursday, Oct. 11, 12:40 a.m. – Officers standing on Camino del Sur observed a woman staggering northbound down the road, stumbling and walking into parked vehicles.</p>\n<p>An officer attempted to contact the 20-year-old woman, but she turned and ran away, but only for a brief moment. The fleeing fugitive managed to get less than half a block before the deputy detained her and placed her on the curb.</p>\n<p>During an intoxicating interrogation, the woman said she did not know where she lived and slurred out several incorrect addresses as she tried to identify her current location.</p>\n<p>While the woman said she had “nothing” to drink, she was uncooperative and combatant, and the deputy had to place her face down and cuff her.</p>\n<p>During the arrest, an unknown man, who was apparently a victim of the directionally challenged woman, thanked the officer for taking the loaded lady off his hands, saying, “We’ve been walking in circles for hours.”</p>\n<p>At the Isla Vista Foot Patrol station, an officer had to remove chairs from the booking room to keep her from climbing and stumbling over them.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Tourist Trap<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 13, 3:21 p.m. – A 20-year-old man was staggering around the 6500 block of DP, looking for Freebirds, when a deputy contacted him.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the man where he was going, to which the man replied, “I’m from San Diego, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>He then appeared as if he were about to topple over, so the deputy grabbed his arm to keep him on his feet.</p>\n<p>The man then told the officer that he had no friends in “I.P.” and had had eight beers that afternoon.</p>\n<p>For the man’s safety, he was arrested for public intoxication.

During transport, the subject began vomiting, which continued all the way to the IVFP office.</p>\n<p>During booking, the man was unable to walk on his own, unable to focus his eyes and gave conflicting information about his identity, confusing his phone and social security numbers.</p>\n<p> The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14661\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14661\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-09/police-blotter-16/","id":3884,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[3883,3882,3881],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"And You May Find Yourself Sleeping on a Sidewalk\nSaturday, Sept. 29, 2:15 a.m. - Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Estero Road came upon an 18-year-old man snoring on the sidewalk.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>And You May Find Yourself Sleeping on a Sidewalk<br>\nSaturday, Sept. 29, 2:15 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Estero Road came upon an 18-year-old man snoring on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>A deputy attempted to contact the man, but the sleeping subject was unresponsive to his directions.</p>\n<p>The officer – who may have gone to masseuse school before becoming a policeman – awoke the man by performing a sternum rub.
