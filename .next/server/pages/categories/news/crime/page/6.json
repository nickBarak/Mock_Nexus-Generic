The car was in drive and running on Embarcadero Road headed towards Del Playa Road. Officers administered a DUI investigation and found the driver had a BAC of .01 percent, with a background check later revealing Jordan as a heroin addict. Jordan admitted to being under the influence of heroin, later confirmed through a urine sample. Deputies also located heroin paraphernalia in his vehicle. Jordan was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail and his vehicle was towed and stored with Loves Towing.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 6, two I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies were walking near Anisq’ Oyo’ Park and recognized Say’Qwaun Ford, a suspect whom they had seen in recent warrant status. He was detained for a records check and with Ford’s consent, deputies searched his backpack. A small pouch of marijuana, a small amount of cocaine and a stolen wallet with multiple items belonging to different people were found. Ford said he found the wallet on the kitchen floor of a party he attended the night before and did not know how the cocaine ended up in his bag, but anticipated his fingerprints would most likely be on it. He admitted to owning the marijuana. Ford, who had a previous history of providing a false identity and burglary, was arrested for theft and possession of illegal substances.</p>\n<p>On the night of Friday, Oct. 9, at approximately 12:46 a.m., law enforcement officers attempted to stop and detain a male suspect on suspicion of an alcohol possession violation. The suspect fled from the officers, drawing attention from other law enforcement officials in the area who ran to assist. One of the assisting officers collided with the suspect, causing him to slam into a parked car and slide to the pavement. Deputies then converged on the suspect as medical assistance made its way to the scene. Upon arrival, paramedics treated the suspect then took him to the hospital for further evaluation. The suspect fractured his left wrist and had several abrasions on his head, hands and knees. UCPD initiated a Use of Force review as a UCPD officer made contact with the suspect.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, an IVFP deputy witnessed a suspect, later identified as Dustin Anthony, strike a male victim in the head with a closed fist in the middle of Del Playa Road. The victim lost consciousness and hit his head on the concrete, causing him to seize and urinate in his pants. The victim was taken to the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital emergency room and Anthony was arrested at the scene and taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, two male students were seen in broad daylight streaking around their residence at 6549 Cervantes. According to the students, they had lost a bet and had to run around the block naked. Two UCPD officers contacted the subjects and issued them citations for public nudity. Clothes were brought to the suspects by each of their parties while tickets were being issued.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65372\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65372\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/","id":3937,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3936,3935,3934],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pizza With Police Focuses on I.V.

Last October, law enforcement personnel assigned to work Halloween weekend in I.V. included UCPD officers from UCSB and other UC campuses, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office deputies, California Highway Patrol and Ventura County Sheriff’s Office, as well investigators from local law enforcement agencies and the Sheriff’s Mounted unit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa said a noise ordinance will be in effect beginning at 6 p.m. during Halloween weekend, largely due to the behavior of out of town visitors who come to I.V. to celebrate the holiday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s more reactionary to people who are from out of town walking in public making noise or resident’s blasting music towards the street than it is to private house parties,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said he hopes the number of people coming to I.V. for Halloween continues to decrease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween and Deltopia have certainly died down in the recent years,” said Signa. “We would like to keep it that way for the safety of our neighbors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD Officer Jon Reyes said I.V. residents should take normal precautions to protect their residencies and vehicles over Halloween weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lock your house and car doors,” Reyes said. “Secure your belongings. We deal with a lot of preventable burglaries.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College of Letters and Science Senator and third-year history of public policy major  Ashcon Minoiefar helped organize the event and said Pizza with Police has been very successful. UCPD and A.S. will be hosting the event every other week in October with a follow-up event after Halloween, according to Minoiefar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pizza with Police went very well,” Minoiefar said in an email. “Since Lt. Mark Signa and I started the event last Halloween, it has consistently brought in 100-200 attendees every time.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minoiefar said Pizza with Police “gets students interested” in public safety and could encourage them to volunteer for community policing programs such as UCIV which is active during Halloween and Deltopia weekends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Creating a culture of community policing and community involvement in public safety, is the first step to moving away from harsh enforcement and high rates of tickets,” Minoiefar said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year biology major Manu Chopra said his interactions with officers at the event caused him to see them, specifically Reyes, as more that “just a police officer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just hearing his stories of past experiences on the force humanized him,” Chopra said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65027\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65027\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/","id":3939,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3938,3937,3936],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrapup May 21-25","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"This weekend, law enforcement responded to two incidents, a break-in and a robbery, in Isla Vista.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This weekend, law enforcement responded to two incidents, a break-in and a robbery, in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Last Thursday at around 2 a.m., I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies were dispatched to a sorority house to investigate an audible alarm. Deputies arrived on scene and found a suspect, later identified as Brian Lopez Aranda, attempting to break in through the living room window. Lopez removed the window screen and triggered the alarm before deputies detained him. Aranda confessed to breaking into the residence because he was “lonely and curious about women.” Deputies arrested him for attempted residential burglary.</p>\n<p>Lopez waived his Miranda rights and informed deputies he entered the sorority house to try and see women. When asked what he would have done if he encountered a female in the residence, Lopez confessed he would have tried to touch her face. IVFP deputies added lewd and dissolute conduct in a public place to the burglary charges, and booked Lopez into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>The streets of I.V. remained quiet Saturday night.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, IVFP deputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers responded to a report of a robbery at the 800 block of Camino del Sur. The suspects were described as a black adult male wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and a shorter, white adult male. The victim was hit in the head by one of the two suspects who both fled the area.

Upon entering the store IVFP deputies saw the subject, later identified as 19-year-old UCSB student Peter Alan Deleon, mopping the floor. After questioning Deleon, deputies arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Friday night, deputies responded to a break-in on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive. Residents who witnessed the break-in said the suspect, identified as Atascadero resident Zachary Devries, jumped onto a car, then fell to the ground near the residency and became violent when asked if he was okay. He punched two subjects and proceeded to break into the residency by shattering a glass door. Residents then beat Devries in self-defense until he became unconscious. He was then transported to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Friday night deputies also responded to a report of a fight in front of Aladdin Café at 938 Embarcadero Del Norte. Witnesses said a subject, identified as 19-year-old Goleta resident Santiago Carmona, punched an employee of the restaurant.

He was then arrested on numerous charges and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Saturday night, deputies responded to a report of a fight on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive.

The victim had a bloody nose and told officers he was “knocked out” by an approximately 6’1” white male adult, possibly named “Devin,” with blonde hair, wearing glasses and a dark shirt. An ambulance took the victim to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, units responded to a report of a fight with one subject unconscious on the 6600 block of Abrego Road. The fight had already dispersed when law enforcement arrived. Witnesses said one suspect, SBCC student Malik Williams, fled the scene and ran into a residence on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive. Williams had knocked the subject unconscious and caused two lacerations on the victim’s face. An ambulance transported the victim to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. Williams was positively identified in a line-up by witnesses who captured the fight on cell phone cameras and was booked and taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Sunday, a victim reported a robbery at his residence on the 6500 block of Seville Road at approximately 4:30 a.m. He told dispatch he last saw the three subjects, two of whom were armed, heading south on foot on toward El Colegio Road. All of the subjects wore masks, dark clothes and hoodies and still remain at large. According to the victim, the suspects asked him for marijuana and money, then took his laptop and phone so he wouldn’t call 911.</p>\n<p>Monday, four IVFP units responded to a report of numerous subjects arguing over drugs and money at approximately 2:00 a.m. at the same apartment building on the 6500 block of Seville Road where Sunday’s burglary took place. Upon arrival, two units noticed one subject fleeing the area and pursued him on foot. The subject remains at large. Moments later, two remaining units detained a suspect exiting the complex with a knife and contraband. The last unit then detained a vehicle with four subjects which contained narcotics. The case is still under a sheriff’s department investigation, with all five detainees having been arrested and one remaining at large.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, Foot Patrol is “pretty certain” the suspects detained Monday are the perpetrators of Sunday’s armed robbery.</p>\n<p>“They basically just hit the place next door,” Plastino said. “The suspect description was the same. The investigation will determine whether they’re the same people from the night before but we’re 99 percent sure.”</p>\n<p>Monday evening at approximately 5:30 p.m., IVFP received report of another armed robbery on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road involving “4 to 5 black male adults armed with a firearm,” according to a UCSB Alert. The suspects remain at large and IVFP is currently investigating.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he believes Monday’s incident is not related to the armed robberies that occurred Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n<p>“I would guess they’re not from the area, but you never know,” Plastino said. “Typically you’ll get gangsters from other counties coming into I.V. to take advantage of students and residents here.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said armed robberies are “unusual” for I.V.</p>\n<p>“Typically you’ll see two to three here per year — they do happen, but not often,” Plastino said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63106\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63106\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/","id":3784,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3783,3782,3781],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up April 24-26","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to a fight, a bicycle theft and an attempted robbery last weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to a fight, a bicycle theft and an attempted robbery last weekend.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, dispatch responded to a call reporting a fight on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive. IVFP deputies and UCPD officers were informed one combatant likely had a weapon and another may have been thrown off of a balcony. The two male subjects fled the scene as officers arrived. An IVFP deputy caught one suspect, Omar Flores, who had a large laceration to his left arm. The other suspect described as a black adult male wearing shorts and no shirt escaped. IVFP conducted an in-field lineup, and witnesses identified Flores as a combatant in the fight. Deputies transported Flores to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for treatment of his arm.</p>\n<p>Later on Thursday night, witnesses reported seeing the other escaped subject enter an apartment near the scene of the fight. Deputies searched the apartment with consent from the residents and found suspect Darris Lee Cotton hiding in a back room. In another in-field lineup, a witness identified Cotton as the second combatant. Cotton reportedly hit Flores in the head repeatedly with a broomstick, causing injury. Deputies arrested Cotton and transported him to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for possible alcohol poisoning. Both Flores and Cotton were later transported to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Saturday morning, an I.V. resident entered the IVFP station just before 7 a.m. to report suspicious activity from two subjects entering backyards on Del Playa Drive and possibly stealing bicycles. Deputies found suspects 21-year-old Jack Vanantwerp and 18-year-old Dillinger Douglas with two bicycles at 7-Eleven on Trigo Road. The suspects admitted to stealing the bicycles and were brought into custody by deputies. The bicycles did not match any reports.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, deputies found SBCC students Joshua Powell and Keaton Jensen attempting to enter an apartment through a window. An investigation followed and deputies determined Powell and Jensen had no reason to enter the apartment. Both subjects were arrested and taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62882\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62882\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/","id":3779,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3778,3777,3776],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVFP Reports Suicide Attempts, Theft, Prank Calls","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Last weekend yielded not too many occurrences thanks in part to Coachella, but included probation violations","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to a series of calls last weekend including theft, probation violation, three suicide attempts and a prank telephone call.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, a 46-year-old homeless man was stopped at Keg-N-Bottle just as he was about to step out of the store with a $40 bottle of Ketel One vodka under his jacket; he was arrested for shoplifting. His 22-page criminal history includes seven convictions for theft related offenses, including four cases of petty theft with a prior offense. All seven offenses involved time in custody and two were prison commitments.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies stopped a car because the occupants were not wearing their seatbelts while driving. During a consent search of the vehicle, deputies discovered hashish and a Vicodin pill in the car and a used hypodermic needle in the passenger’s pocket. The passenger is a self-admitted heroin addict and the driver, who was arrested for possession of the illegal substances, was on an “own recognizance release,” a written promise to appear at all court hearings, and on probation for burglary. Both were also charged with being under the influence of illegal substances.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, a subject threw themselves from the second story of their apartment building on the 800 block of Camino Lindo in an attempt to commit suicide. The subject, a UCSB student, was transported to a hospital and remains there in stable condition.</p>\n<p>According to law enforcement, Saturday night was relatively quiet, which officers credit to the popular Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival which draws many students out of town for the weekend.</p>\n<p>However, law enforcement dealt with another suicide scare this Saturday. IVFP received a call from a friend of the subject. The reporting party called from Ventura, stating that her friend, a Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student, was reportedly in the I.V. area and was distraught. The caller reported the friend having said, “I am going to take the ultimate sleep,” after which she immediately telephoned law enforcement. Deputies were dispatched to check the local beaches, ultimately unsuccessfully and an attempt was made to locate the subject’s iPhone. Shortly after, a GPS located the phone in Los Alamos. Further investigation found that the subject lived in Nipomo and, according to the caller, could have possibly been driving home. The subject’s parents were contacted and some 30 minutes later the subject arrived home. The parents stated their son seemed fine and were advised to call 9-1-1 if they suspected he needed any mental health or emergency assistance.</p>\n<p>On Sunday night, a student called to report his girlfriend had said she was going to kill herself. After confirming that threat was potentially plausible, units responded to her residence at 6600 block of Trigo to check on her welfare. However, they were unable to make contact, even after entry was made through an unsecured door. Further investigation and GPS cell phone locating revealed the woman was in the area of Veronica Springs Road near Elings Park in Santa Barbara, where one of her friends lives, according to the caller. Responding officers requested Goleta units check the area, along with the last known location of the phone; they were also provided with the subject’s vehicle description. All searches yielded negative results.</p>\n<p>Later on Sunday, a student called to say she and her sister received prank phone calls within an hour of each other. The student said her call was a partially pre-recorded computer voice intermixed with a live caller that was antagonistic. When she told the caller she was bored and was going to hang up, the caller became angry and cursed at her, calling her by name.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, the sister of the student said she was not threatened at all by the call and hung up after just a few seconds. It is suspected that the calls were related but no solid suspect could be determined and an investigation is ongoing.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/","id":3781,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3780,3779,3778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up April 10-12","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista law enforcement dealt with multiple reports from residents including an attempted suicide, a resistant probationer and a missing persons report last week.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista law enforcement dealt with multiple reports from residents including an attempted suicide, a resistant probationer and a missing persons report last week.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, day-shift deputies handled a residential burglary on the 6500 block of Trigo Road. After speaking with the victim, deputies collected evidence and established probable cause to arrest a female suspect.</p>\n<p>Thursday night, a female walked into the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) office and filed a report for an anonymous message she had read on the anonymous social network Yik Yak. The unidentified sender stated the individual had gone into the woods and tried to hang himself, but was unsuccessful when the branch of the tree he was using snapped. The sender continued to post that he was depressed because his parents had been killed the day before and that he had no desire to live. Deputies received an additional call for service stating that another reporting party had read the same message on Yik Yak and was concerned for the sender’s safety.</p>\n<p>Deputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers tracked the location of the posting and organized a search stretching from the bluffs west of Camino Majorca out toward Campus Point, but failed to locate the sender. As the search was occurring, the sender deleted the original message and posted another stating his roommate had found him and taken him home. Law enforcement responded and searched the area once more, but was unable to locate any associated persons. A report was written and the search for the sender was canceled after all resources were utilized.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies went to a residence on the 6700 block of Abrego Road to conduct a probation search on a probationer. The probationer remained passive-aggressive throughout the encounter and delayed the investigation by not allowing deputies to search his electronic media. He was arrested and booked for resisting arrest and for violating his probation.</p>\n<p>Dispatch received a call on Saturday night that immediately hung up when answered. Upon callback, the anonymous reporting party alerted dispatch in Spanish that the probationer from the previous night was in a fight with his father. Deputies returned to the residence and found the probationer restrained by his father. Further investigation revealed the probationer punched his father during an argument, and the son was booked into City of Santa Barbara Jail after his father signed a citizen’s arrest for battery.</p>\n<p>Also on Saturday night, a victim reported from the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive said she woke to the sound of someone in her bedroom. Though she was unable to see the subject in the dark, the victim believed it was one of her roommates. The victim reported hearing her wallet being unzipped and the subject leaving the room, and later discovered $160 had been taken from her. She called her roommates and learned none of them were home, and the front door had been unlocked.</p>\n<p>Officers received a missing person’s report Saturday night of a female who was last seen walking westbound on the 6600 block of Pasado Road. The female was said to be highly intoxicated and ignored her friends’ attempts to take care of her. Officials conducted a search of the area and the female’s cell phone was remotely located, but the location was several hours old and the phone was powered off. It was later reported that the female returned home, and she was removed from the Missing and Unidentified Persons System.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, a victim reported her laptop was stolen from her home on the 6500 block of Segovia Road.

Deputies searched the area and located the subject, who provided false identification as James “Parilo.” The name “Parilo” was not found during a records check, despite several attempts to locate a match. The subject continued to provide the name “Parilo” and a false date of birth, until a California identification card was located in his wallet and he was identified as James Parillo. Parillo had an active warrant out for his arrest in Georgia and chose not to be extradited. He was ultimately arrested for providing a false identification and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, a large swastika was found scratched into the hood of a black Lexus in a carport at 6500 Cordoba. Law enforcement determined the vandalism had no apparent target, as the victim said she did not have disputes with anyone and is not Jewish.</p>\n<p>During the Friday day shift, IVFP deputies responded to ongoing complaints from the Isla Vista Elementary School staff concerning vehicles parked illegally in front of the school. The staff reported that the illegally parked vehicles were obstructing parents’ vehicles as they dropped off and picked up their children from school and that it constituted safety hazard because it forced students to walk in the middle of the roadway to get to school. IVFP deputies issued 28 parking citations and 16 warnings that gave the vehicle owners 72 hours to move their cars.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP recorded 21 physical, 17 adult and 4 juvenile arrests and issued dozens of citations. On the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde, deputies arrested four students during a fight involving more than eight people using fists and a broken cane. The subjects resisted arrest and had to be subdued with impact weapons. La Jolla High School student Jake Rosenthal, his brother and UCSB student Bryce Rosenthal and Santa Barbara City College student Mason Rutherford were treated by American Medical Response on scene and booked into county jail. The juvenile who started the fight was visiting I.V. from San Diego with the Rosenthal brothers and was booked into Santa Maria Juvenile Hall for providing a false identification.</p>\n<p>Later on Friday, deputies found Garrett Kosloff in his vehicle snorting a line of Xanax on the 6700 block of Trigo Road. He was also in possession of a half-pound of marijuana that he admitted to selling to his friends. Kosloff was arrested and booked into county jail. Deputies also found students in possession of marijuana and alcohol when they responded to a noise complaint concerning a property on the 6600 block of El Colegio. Upon searching the property, deputies found underage female students from the English First (EF) language school in Santa Barbara, drinking alcohol. The party hosts, EF student Armendariz Izquierda and UCSB student Luis Ortiz, were arrested for contributing to the delinquency of minors. The EF students were released from the IVFP station to EF staff.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, IVFP recorded seven physical arrests and 12 citations. On Sunday, IVFP units assisted the UCPD with an area search near Phelps Road and Cannon Green Drive, after a report of multiple females screaming in the area. Units searched westbound on foot along the bluffs and ended up at Ellwood Elementary, but made no discoveries.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61561\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61561\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/","id":3780,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3779,3778,3777],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter Feb. 9-17","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista last week regarding prowling, theft, public intoxication and animal mistreatment, among other crimes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista last week regarding prowling, theft, public intoxication and animal mistreatment, among other crimes.</p>\n<p>On Monday, law enforcement confronted a female SBCC student outside I.V. Market after she stole a bottle of tequila. Deputies arrested the suspect for theft and minor in possession. Later on Monday, deputies responded to reported gunshots at Ocean Meadows golf course. I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) and Goleta Sheriff’s units responded and established a perimeter around the course and an air unit was deployed. Further investigation of the incident determined reports to be unfounded.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, IVFP units responded to an anonymous call about animal mistreatment taking place in I.V. Authorities identified and requested to search April Stewart’s vehicle to check the welfare of her dogs and found she was in possession of a used hypodermic needle and a glass pipe commonly used to smoke methamphetamine. According to the IVFP, residue left in the pipe indicated recent use. Stewart’s animals were also found to be not properly cared for and Stewart was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, violation of probation and cruelty to animals.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, deputies subdued a man refusing to pay a cab driver on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde. The suspect, later identified as Darris Cotton, was seen evading the cab driver and attempting to flee. Deputies were able to contact Cotton, who the cab driver wanted to have arrested for petty theft for failure to pay. After deputies conducted a records check on Cotton, it was discovered he was on parole for robbery and was subsequently arrested for violation of parole.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP stopped SBCC student Jose De Alba, who was walking down the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde carrying a laptop. When confronted, De Alba’s story contained conflicting evidence and upon further investigation deputies found the had just committed a residential burglary, though officials declined to state where the burglary occurred. The laptop was returned and De Alba was arrested.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday, a male subject was reported to be “prowling,” lurking in an area intending to commit a crime, in a backyard on the 6700 block of Pasado. The property resident was able to provide a detailed description of the suspect who was later identified and arrested in an in-field lineup.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, IVFP recorded nine arrests and 12 citations. On the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde, a male subject was observed walking in a small group being extremely loud. The subject was trying to high five passersbys and was determined to be causing a disturbance with the potential to cause a fight. The male and his friends began to flee once they saw law enforcement approaching. Subjects fled for about two blocks but were apprehended at International Food Market. The original male was located in the back parking lot of the store, out of breath and urinating on himself. He was charged for public intoxication, fleeing law enforcement and urinating in public.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, deputies recorded three arrests and six citations. On Sunday night, Pizza My Heart employees reported a female who had been at the restaurant drinking all day. She left and returned later, more intoxicated than she had been when she left. She was socializing with restaurant patrons and then began to pass out on a table. Alone and unable to care for her own safety, she was arrested for public intoxication. Later, Garden Court Security reported an intoxicated male in the courtyard area causing a disturbance. He fled the complex, but was located at 880 Camino del Sur and arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Finally, at approximately 9:15 a.m. on Tuesday the 17th, deputies responded to a call of a subject who appeared to be injured within a vehicle in the parking lot of Goleta Beach.  Upon arrival, it was discovered that the male victim was killed by an apparent gunshot wound.  The Sheriff’s Coroner’s Unit is investigating, but law enforcement reports that at this point no foul play is suspected.   No further information will be released until the victim’s next-of-kin has been notified.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/","id":3778,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3777,3776,3775],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sheriff’s Dept., ABC Cite Seven I.V.

Both cases hit the victim in the leg, and she whom suffered swelling and bruising on her inner right knee. Rodriguez became highly agitated once the authorities arrived. The victim later signed a citizen’s arrest and Rodriguez was taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, deputies responded to a call for a possible verbal altercation between domestic partners on the 6600 block of Trigo. Subsequent investigation found there was no argument taking place. However, the 19-year-old male resident, Jose Benitez of Santa Barbara, had three outstanding misdemeanor warrants and was arrested.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, an I.V.
