Oprah — in her infinite wisdom and grace — broached the subject with a dramatic and weighted, “Parents, brace yourself.” I never saw the full episode, but can only assume Oprah proceeded to depict a scene in which sixteen-year-old girls, such as myself at the time, were gobbling penises by the dozen. Within a week of the program, my two best friends and I had all received the “you-aren’t-doing-this-are-you?” confrontation from our respective mothers.</p>\n<p>I now realize conversations of this nature must have been as uncomfortable for my poor mother as they were for me. The moments before beginning this sort of conversation must be like standing at a precipice, filled with dread and butterflies. Finally, she would garner enough courage and dive right into the topic with what came off as little tact or consideration.</p>\n<p>“So, tell me what you know about oral sex.” What? Shit. Where is this coming from? Blindsided! What is the right answer? Should I come clean? Shit. Shit.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Well, I don’t know. What do you mean? I know what it is. It sounds gross to me,” I shot back both indignantly and cautiously.</p>\n<p>At this point in time, I had been with the same boyfriend for three years. Yeah, we had been engaging in oral sex.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t our first time around the block with the “birds and the bees” talk. My mom had played this card before, and conditions were always the same: Coerce me into running errands with her, wait until the car is moving and doors are locked and casually bring up the least casual discourse a mother and a teenager can engage in. Every time I was overcome with nausea and carefully assessed my options — open the car door and throw myself into oncoming traffic, and/or simply break into a fit of guilty tears. I have to admit, it’s a brilliant tactic — the in-car sex talk.</p>\n<p>“Well, do you have any friends who do that sort of thing?” she pressed.</p>\n<p>“I mean, I’ve heard of people doing it. I don’t know anyone really well, though. Mostly the more loose girls. None of my friends.”</p>\n<p>Using terms she’s comfortable with was a strategy I had developed over the years. “Loose” to describe “slutty,” “rubbers” to describe “condoms,” “intimacy” to describe “boning.” It was important to make her feel comfortable and convinced so the conversation would end as quickly and painlessly as possible.</p>\n<p>“Good, because I’ve heard that kids these days are shockingly nonchalant about oral sex. You know, that’s something extremely intimate — like post-marriage. I mean, my generation really never even considered that as something to do except with someone you’re extremely comfortable with, like your husband.”</p>\n<p>Oh, Jesus-fucking-Christ. She’s talking about Dad.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fast-forward a year. My high school boyfriend and I broke up after his departure to college, and my friends and I were asked to junior prom by the boys in the grade below us. At this point, I had thoughtfully considered my mother and Oprah’s concerns, and decide to just skip the oral sex.</p>\n<p>The dance had ceased and the after-party had commenced. Before I knew it, Ryan* and I were in someone’s brother’s bed. I knew Ryan in the same way I know a lot of people in my hometown — our brothers grew up playing on the same sports team, and at some point in time we began to acknowledge our friendship, or at least acquaintanceship. Well, this night we got to know each other much better.</p>\n<p>Having only ever slept with one other person, I was surprised by how agilely he navigated my body. He molded me into position after position with the ease of a porn star. Earlier that night, his fancily gelled hair and awkwardly large tux subconsciously told me he meant business, but I couldn’t help but be surprised and impressed with his bedroom cool.</p>\n<p>Immediately after, as he hovered above me in push-up position, he reached toward his hipbone and feigned retrieval of something from his pocket. Granted, he was naked — there was no pocket. He proceeded to pull an imaginary card from his “pocket” and handed it to me.</p>\n<p>“What is this?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“My V-card. It’s all yours.”</p>\n<p>Blindsided again. Should have just stuck with a BJ.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In hindsight, I realize how out of touch I was with my body and sexuality in high school. To be honest, I often still feel mystified by the incredible variance in sexual comfort levels, and often struggle to define my own comfort threshold. I have friends who have slept with triple the amount of people I have and other friends who are still virgins. For some reason the common denominator is that we’re all constantly quantifying our sexual experiences.</p>\n<p>I myself have what I can only describe as a number fixation. Every so often I catch myself treating my sex life like a diet, and half-jokingly declaring, “I’m watching my numbers.” I’m also slightly notorious for demanding to know any new partner’s number well before the conversation is anywhere near appropriate.</p>\n<p>Although difficult to completely define, I believe the pressure I feel to keep my number low is a product of both internal and external factors. I will never claim to be immune to the virgin-whore dichotomy so often projected onto women. Somewhere along the way, media, cultural tradition, family and religious standards have told me I am worth less as a woman if I am “damaged goods.” I’m reluctant to admit acquiescence to negative misogynistic constructs, but I think it’s important to acknowledge the effect they’ve had on my self-evaluation.</p>\n<p>However, I’ll hand it to you, Mom. Sex is intimacy. Time spent having sex with a person belongs to only you two. Never are you more vulnerable than those moments in the bedroom. In my opinion, it’s important to acknowledge that sex is complicated and personal. Reflection on your own definition of sexuality is time well spent. Ignore Oprah, carry the V-card in your wallet with pride and own your number — be it zero, one or 100.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42472\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42472\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/","id":3509,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3508,3507,3506],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Trick or Treat?

I’m not saying you should regularly run around looking like a slut, because I will judge you then. But to do so in the privacy of your room? You go, Glenn Coco.</p>\n<p>We’ve all fantasized about being the sexy librarian, naughty schoolgirl, busty nurse, elusive Playboy bunny … the list goes on, and I guarantee your study buddy is dying to help you work your way down it. And up it. And through it … in the projection room above the auditorium.</p>\n<p>Make it as extensive or short-lived as you want. Role playing is hot as hell. Channel our favorite Brits, David Beckham and Posh Spice — you know you’ve thought about how great their sex has to be — and you’ll be fornicating like never before … all fierce and repulsively good-looking. And I’m not talking about soccer when I say bend it like Beckham. Spice up your life people — just like math, sex is the same in every country.</p>\n<p>There’s something about role playing that’s somewhat insightful. Your closet sex addict has a way of surfacing under the facade of your character and its honestly quite liberating — you may never admit to yourself that you have that alter ego (Boo, you whore), so the seductive burlesque costume is the perfect disguise.</p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, we all love Halloween. There’s a reason we’re already plotting next year’s scantily clad outfits.

There’s something about nature that really gets my blood flowing.</strong></p>\n<p>Whether it’s the fresh air and blue skies or the thrill of being caught pants-down in public, getting buck-wild in the great outdoors is guaranteed to bring out your inner animal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Usher isn’t the only one who wants a lady in the street but a freak in the bed.</strong></p>\n<p>Pain and pleasure are two sides of the same coin, so get loud, get dirty and don’t hesitate to rough us up a bit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. Toys aren’t just for kids — especially the ones you can find in your local sex shop.</strong></p>\n<p>From anal beads to vibrator sleeves, these XXX Toys “R” Us are bound (and gagged) to have something for everyone. Bring your man along and peruse the adult store’s various cuffs, lubes, stimulators, rings and molds together to stimulate each others’ minds and bodies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. I can guarantee nothing will make a guy’s jaw hit the floor faster than your ability to contort into a human pretzel.</strong></p>\n<p>A little flexibility goes a long way and opens the door to a world of crazy sex positions to hit your G-spot from every angle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6. Half the fun of having sex is getting to see each other undress.</strong></p>\n<p>No guy wants to see you in what looks like your grandmother’s hand-me-downs, so take the time to visit Victoria’s Secret and pick out some sexy lingerie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7. Your body is a temple, so put in the time and effort to take care of it.</strong></p>\n<p>Exercising and eating healthy are a major part of my life, so it’s important for a woman to feel the same way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8. Vaginas are the unofficial eighth natural wonder of the world.</strong></p>\n<p>There is so much going on down there and until someone creates a universal manual for guys like me, we’re going to need your help figuring out what you like and where you like it. Spend some time getting to know your body. If you don’t know what makes you tick, how can we?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9. Make your time with him special.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not saying you have to pretend like your drunken encounter at some party Friday night on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive is anything more than a one night stand, but I’m likely to lose interest if I think you’re just as content winding up in my bed as any other guy’s room in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10. Nothing’s more of a turn on than when, in the middle of foreplay, a woman stops and whispers in your ear, “I’m going to fuck you so good.”</strong></p>\n<p>However, it really ruins the effect when it turns out they know less about the art of sex than my 11-year-old brother. Be honest with your partner: If you don’t know your way around his joystick, let him know.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42466\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42466\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/","id":3507,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3506,3505,3504],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Top 10 Misconceptions About Sex","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What we think and what’s true, based on information from UCSB professor John Baldwin, sexuality specialist, and http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo, the website created by Baldwin and his wife as a comp...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>What we think and what’s true, based on information from UCSB professor John Baldwin, sexuality specialist, and http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo, the website created by Baldwin and his wife as a comprehensive source of sex education.</em></p>\n<p><strong>1.

There is a high risk of pregnancy, since a man may unknowingly release sperm inside the vagina before his orgasm. Sperm can also find their way into the vagina from outside the opening if the male is slow to pull out and starts to ejaculate before he has completely removed his penis from the vaginal area. However, recent studies show that this actually works better than perceived. If you absolutely NEED to have sex, it’s better than nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Women want multiple orgasms</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of women just want ONE orgasm. Multiple orgasms don’t usually occur in the 20-24 age group. It takes time to understand a woman’s body and what it wants on both partners’ account.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Gay guys only have anal sex</strong></p>\n<p>Actually, the most common type of sex homosexual males have is oral. But as for anal sex, they are considerably more cautious about the dangers of the behavior than heterosexuals: They are more likely to use condoms for STD protection, whereas heterosexuals generally only think of condoms as birth control for penile-vaginal sex.</p>\n<p><strong>5. I should hide my “bad” body parts</strong></p>\n<p>That should be the last thing you worry about. It’s a shame to handicap yourself by refusing to go on top because you think your stomach bulges. This country places so much emphasis on body image, but personality should be more important than looks. The hottest person in the party might be your ideal, but if they open their mouth and they’re an idiot or a jerk, why would you want to sleep with them anyway? You should ENJOY the experience, not just look good doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>6. The Morning After Pill is the only contraceptive I need</strong></p>\n<p>Emergency contraceptives are not nearly as good as using birth control all the time. That being said, it is a good thing to have in your medicine chest — it takes anxiety, stress and fear out of your mind. What if you get into a situation where you do need an emergency contraceptive? Condom breaks? Miss a pill? It is a good thing to turn to right away. The FDA recently approved a new emergency contraceptive: ella. It has full effectiveness over the course of five days (in which sperm inhabit women’s bodies) but is only available by prescription. Visit ella-kwikmed.com for an online medical consultation and prescription.</p>\n<p><strong>7. I can’t get pregnant if I have sex on my period</strong></p>\n<p>It IS possible to get pregnant while on your period. You are most likely to become pregnant during ovulation, which generally occurs 14 days after the start of your last period — but this time is variable. Sperm can live in a woman’s body for five days; if it is still present during ovulation, you CAN get pregnant.</p>\n<p><strong>8. My sexual fantasies reflect my sexual orientation</strong></p>\n<p>Homosexuals have heterosexual fantasies and heterosexuals have homosexual fantasies. Don’t take these too seriously; they don’t reveal anything about your sexual orientation. Likewise, these fantasies aren’t usually the most common — your dreams and fantasies are based on crazy associations and random thoughts — they bounce all over the place.</p>\n<p><strong>9. The tighter the condom, the better</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to condoms, knowledge and skill are more important than anything else. You should always properly put on a condom and take precautions to hold onto it while pulling it out. Females, you should learn how to put it on him in a way that excites him — he won’t be able to say no. If he’s not going to do it the way you want, you can always say no.</p>\n<p><strong>10. I can learn everything about sex from porn</strong></p>\n<p>Soc152A is made up of 2/3 women and 1/3 men. Some guys think they don’t need to know anything other than what they’ve seen in porn. However, it offers an unrealistic presentation of sex. Girls can actually tell when a guy has only learned from porn … and it’s usually not a good thing. There is actually a large repertoire of skills men can acquire that would significantly increase sexual pleasure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Amanda Hill is the</em> Daily Nexus <em>Managing Editor</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/top-10-misconceptions-sex/","id":3505,"author":{"id":332,"name":"Amanda Hill"},"related":[3504,3503,3502],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"What Do You Want in Bed?: She said","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"1.

We want you to pay a lot of attention to the exciting parts.</strong></p>\n<p>Women are capable of having more than one orgasm in a short amount of time, and we are more than willing to prove this to you. Don’t save the big moment for sex, that’s just the finale. Especially after we’ve gone down on you and you’ve made the mistake of either bouncing our heads like a basketball or trying to read Morse code on our scalps, it wouldn’t be such a bad idea for you to return the favor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. We want you to respect us.</strong></p>\n<p>We know that we’re not the only girl that you’ve done these things with, but we want to feel like we are. We want to feel like both of us are genuinely enjoying ourselves and not just trying to get off.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. We want you to let us be a whore in the bedroom.</strong></p>\n<p>Shit, we want to be a lady on your arm, sure, but we want to be a closet whore, too. We want to see your skills and prove we have a few tricks up our sleeves too. We don’t want to just be a notch on your bedpost — we want to be a fucking accomplishment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. We want you to be sweet and sensitive.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to care about us. We want you to go slow and make sure we’re getting what we want. We want to feel every sensation, not just to be jack-hammered to death.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6. We want you to be aggressive and rough.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to make us go insane to the point where, if the sheets are still on the bed afterwards, it wasn’t even worth remembering. We want to see how loudly our bed creaks and we want our neighbors to call their landlords and ask for soundproof walls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7. We want you to talk to us.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to compliment us. We want you to say something cute. We want you to make us laugh.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8. We want you to shut the fuck up.</strong></p>\n<p>We don’t want you to say that one thing that you think will be really hot and sexy in the moment that actually isn’t. Don’t ruin the mood by giving us a play-by-play of what’s going on either — we’re getting a firsthand experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9. We want you to tease us.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to play a little hard-to-get. We want to get to the point where we have to have you. We want to get as close to the edge as we can and then have to start again from somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10. We want you to have sex with us. Right. Now.</strong></p>\n<p>Hey, now, don’t tease us too much. At some point we want you to cut the bullshit and make it happen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yeah, okay, I contradicted myself a couple times. It’s not that we don’t know what we want, we just kind of, well … want it all. It depends on the day, I guess.

You can be a firecracker in the sheets, a sensual god(dess), a carnal connoisseur or, to put it bluntly, just damn good at sex — but that by no means prepares you for the dreaded small talk as you’re both waking up and becoming intensely aware of just how naked you are.</p>\n<p>Although charming moments like these may spur the desire to vow abstinence and get thee to a nunnery — I guess Shakespeare understood? — it’s easier to just laugh it off and accept that, in a decade or three, you’ll probably stop blushing, and he or she won’t remember that your exiting phrase was “later, skater.”</p>\n<p>After three years of this shit, I’ve pretty much concluded that I gravitate toward all things awkward. In fact, I may be a bit of a masochist if the definition includes the desire to humiliate oneself to an unreasonable extent in front of as many people as possible, in the strangest way imaginable.</p>\n<p>My junior year, I fell off a bunk bed mid-hookup, cascading off a dresser and landing on a side table, waking up his alarmed roommate, who was probably wondering why some spastic girl was going on a rampage around their room.</p>\n<p>Another time I was dancing at a party and things were getting sweaty (since I’m not one of those inhuman girls who won’t even gently perspire at the gym). Everything was going smoothly until I felt one half of my adhesive bra slide off and, not knowing what to do, ripped of the entire thing and shoved it in my pocket. This almost went unnoticed, until I looked down and saw that the left boob had fallen on the ground and attached to the shoe of the guy I was dancing with. It’s all a bit of a blur now, but in the next few moments my instincts took over and I ended up rushing off before we had to discuss why I’d just torn a boob off his foot.</p>\n<p>But my finest hour by far was one afternoo­n when I was coming out of the morning’s thick delirium that causes me to take on one of many wildly inappropriate, hungover alter-egos. Afternoon goodbyes are much more risky than morning ones because the night’s intoxicants have almost worn off entirely and you’re likely to run into 20 or so acquaintances on your way home. At the very least, I expected the stretch from the bedroom to the front door to be painless, until I emerged into the living room, looking like I’d just returned from the war, only to be greeted by a standing ovation of five to 10 guys. The welcoming parade didn’t end at the door though — they followed me outside, chanting my name and fist-pumping as I sprint-walked down the street, entertaining Bagel Café diners and a house full of laughing college boys, sending me off the classy way.</p>\n<p>So we all rack up a few gems after years of navigating the I.V. hookup culture. I’m here to tell you to just relax, and possibly even relish in the fact that you have some funny ones under your belt.

Alongside “U Can Study Buzzed,” we’re boasting the nicknames “University of Casual Sex and Beer” and “UCSTD.” As soon as I got accepted, the rumors of one in four STI-infected students plagued me.</p>\n<p>However, according to Malek Guerbaoui, Sex and Relationships liaison at the office of Student Health, the rates for UCSB “are right on par with the national average … going to UCSB results in no higher likelihood of contracting an STI.”</p>\n<p>While waiting in the office of Student Health for an STI test, a few unnerving thoughts come to mind. The first one comes from a story my friend told me about an archaic method of STI testing that involves the insertion of an umbrella-like object into unmentionable parts, only for it to be to pried open and scraped to collect God knows what. The second thought: “What if I actually have something?” I mean, I haven’t had the most active year, mind you, but these test results could change my life in grave and unpredictable ways. I guess HPV wouldn’t be so bad for me, and I know chlamydia can be taken care of easily, but the big ones? I shudder to think…</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The wait is short and Phlebotomist Nicky Guzmán draws two vials of blood quickly and painlessly. UCSB provides walk-in service for STI testing of HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea: blood is drawn for HIV and syphilis for free if you have USHIP insurance, and there is a $20 fee per urine test for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Urine testing is most effective if one hasn’t urinated for over an hour before the test. The entire test, including registering and waiting, took approximately 20 minutes, though I only had blood drawn.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Student Health center also readily offers other types of tests for STIs, though they require meeting with a physician. HPV, herpes and molluscum contagiosum (warts caused by a poxvirus after direct contact with an affected area) can be treated after a visual exam with a physician. For ladies, vaginal infections such as yeast infections require pelvic exams. Appointments for all of these exams can be made via the UCSB Student Health website.</p>\n<p>Having gone through the process of STI testing, I can tell you that it was easy and well worth it. It is better to know about these things sooner than later, and Guerbaoui suggests that, even if you don’t show any symptoms, an STI test may be worth your while: “the number one symptom of STIs is not having symptoms.”</p>\n<p>Getting regular STI tests is the mature and responsible thing to do, not only for your own health, but also for the health of people with whom you engage in sexual relations. You put them at risk if you put off STI testing.</p>\n<p>The Student Health STI information packet makes one message incredibly clear. Bolded, underlined and italicized: “Condom use can minimize your chances of contracting all of the above infections.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42457\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42457\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/","id":3503,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3502,3501,3500],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: The League of Extraordinary Quarterbacks","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"[media-credit name=”Ian Sander” align=”alignleft” width=”250″][/media-credit]Lloyd Christmas: “I’m ready for commitment, Harry!

There has been some killer games and moments, plenty of action and surprises, as well as record-breaking performances.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the league’s quarterbacks — and some of their unstoppable offenses — have emphatically stolen the show through three games this season, carnivorously feasting on opposing defenses.</p>\n<p>In week one alone, Tom Brady and Chad Henne combined for 906 passing yards, an NFL single-game record, and quarterbacks combined for 7,842 yards, more than in any other week in NFL history. Even more astounding, 14 quarterbacks passed for 300 or more yards more than in any week, and there were five games, the most in history, with two 300-yard passers.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, an unbelievable five QBs are on pace to break Dan Marino’s single season passing record of 5,084 yards. Matthew Stafford, who has his popular breakout candidate Detroit Lions at 3-0 for the first time in 31 years, is on pace to throw for 5,210 yards. Philip Rivers is on pace for 5,221. Rookie of the Year Cam Newton (can we just give him the trophy now?) is on pace for 5,397. Drew Brees is on pace for 5,648, and finally, his royalty — coming in at 34 years of age, standing at 6’4”, weighing in 225 lbs., with long, blonde flowing locks, a beautiful wife, and sporting UGG shoes — is Tom Brady, who, after passing for 940 for two games, 1,327 for three yards through three games, is on pace to throw for a godly 7,077 yards on the season.</p>\n<p>Those on the receiving end of this plethora of passing yards are also on their way to breaking records. Wes Welker, after last week’s insane line of 16 grabs for 217 yards and 2 TDs against the Bills, is one pace to grab 165 catches for 2,443 yards on the season — both would be NFL records. Additionally, Pittsburgh’s Mike Wallace and Carolina’s Steve Smith are on pace to beat Jerry Rice’s single season record of 1,848 receiving yards.</p>\n<p>Okay, okay. Calm down. I know, I know. It has only been three weeks. I know. Buuut stillllll. Pretty amazing. While it’s far too early to truly extrapolate and expect record-breaking performances, there is something to take away from this.</p>\n<p>The NFL — where traditionally you need to establish the run and feature a stingy defense to succeed — has become a full-blown quarterback league. It has been headed this way for a little while now, but we are now there. You absolutely NEED a star quarterback to compete. I would rather have Tom Brady than the entire Jets defense, because the old mantra of “defense wins championships” no longer holds true. You NEED an offense capable of scoring 30 points, and that starts with a star QB.</p>\n<p>It could be that new rule changes are protecting quarterbacks and wide receivers more than ever, and that, without pressure, the great quarterbacks of the league are able to pick apart secondaries like never before. Defenses are being effectively hindered by an increasing amount of restrictive rules. Also, offenses — with no-huddle sets and innovative formations starring empty backfields, three wide receiver sets, and pass-catching running backs and tight ends  — have become so evolved, and defenses have yet to catch up. The great quarterbacks are winning the chess battle, allowing their teams to effectively take advantage of the mismatches they create.</p>\n<p>The truly surprising part of this is that it is happening so early in the year. I mean, I thought that because of the lockout, offenses were supposed to struggle to find a rhythm and get in sync, and low scoring defensive affairs were sure to happen. Not so much. I mean, Brady came just 13 yards short of becoming the first QB to pass for 400 yards in three consecutive games. EVER. And he did it in the first three weeks, and after a lockout shortened off-season because it is an adjective training camp.</p>\n<p>Could it be that defenses — in particular secondaries — are the units that are out of sync? There has been an abundance of blown coverages and pass interference penalties. It does make sense that the missed training camp time would hurt defenses more; a secondary unit relies more on the unity and cohesiveness of the group more than an offense. Rather than running routes with set assignments as an offense does, a defense must not only adapt to the offense, but also to each other.</p>\n<p>Either way, the NFL does love these high-scoring affairs, as should you. So sit back, and enjoy them; unless of course you are inexcusably stuck watching a brutal 49ers/Bengals game (AKA the largest pillow fight in NFL football history).

I know you’ve been confused without me. You’ve been biting your fingernails wondering just what to do with your fantasy team. Well fret no more, for I am here to help, and just in time too. In case you weren’t paying attention, there is a new collective bargaining agreement, and football is back. Yet it is a different league than it was, as the aftermath of the new collective bargaining agreements saw players who had been cornerstones of their teams for years cut and traded.<br>\nOne such player is Chad Ochocinco, the wide receiver formerly known as Chad Johnson, who is now with the New England Patriots after spending the previous 10 years with the Bengals. Now I know some of you saw that and decided to draft him for your fantasy team, believing that he’d come in and immediately take over the role that Randy Moss once played. I understand why you would think that, but it’s completely stupid.<br>\nOcho, while speedy, was never a deep threat on the level of Moss, and the Patriots run arguably the most complex offense in the league. Expecting him to come in and pick it up immediately after a shortened offseason and after spending the previous 10 years working in a much simpler offense is expecting a miracle. There was absolutely no way it was going to happen.<br>\nHowever, I do believe it will be sooner rather than later that Ochocinco will start to step up. Yes, he hasn’t done much through the first three weeks of the season and yes, he did drop an easy pass from Tom Brady that would have gone for a touchdown against the Bills, but he has a lot of things going for him right now. First of all, he no longer has the stupidest, most self-indulgent name in sports. That dubious honor now belongs to Ron Artest, otherwise known as Metta World Peace.<br>\nSecondly, the Patriots’ offense, while complex, requires hard work and promotes constant improvement in those willing to put in the work. Talented players like Ochocinco can thrive in that offense if they work hard — and Ocho does want to work, if only to prove that he’s still one of the best. He is learning the offense, slowly but surely. The mere fact that he was targeted on that long pass against Buffalo is evidence of that, as in the previous two games he had only been targeted on short passes. He will, eventually, be the deep threat for New England.<br>\nFinally, the Patriots have a lot of weapons. While that does mean that Ochocinco will see fewer targets than he would on a team where he was the featured weapon, it also means that defenses can’t focus on him alone. They also have to watch out for Deion Branch, Wes Welker, Aaron Hernandez, Rob Gronkowski and the myriad of other receivers that the Patriots roll out each week, all of whom are capable and dangerous. As an added bonus, the Patriots have a respectable ground game. The Law Firm named BenJarvus Green-Ellis was a 1000 yard rusher a year ago and Danny Woodhead is quick and a good receiver out of the backfield. Additionally, rookie Stevan Ridley looked good against the Bills.<br>\nI don’t mean to overly praise the Patriots. My point is simply that most teams can’t afford to double team Ochocinco because of all the weapons Tom Brady has at his disposal. Once Ocho learns the offense, and he will, he will be able to break that single coverage for long scores. He still has that ability, so don’t be discouraged by his early season struggles. New England will be good for him in the end, and he will produce. If you drafted him thinking he’d immediately be a major contributor…well, you shouldn’t have. But don’t give up on him just yet. If I’m right, and I usually am, those who are patient will be rewarded.<br>\nPick Up of the Week: Matt Hasselbeck, QB, Tennessee Titans. Thus far Hasselbeck seems rejuvenated. He’s thrown for over 300 yards in two of his first three games with the Titans to go along with seven touchdowns. He’s developed a good rapport with receiver Kenny Britt, and with the exception of this week the two have been torching defenses, including the stout Baltimore Ravens. With running back Chris Johnson still struggling to get going, Hasselbeck is going to be asked to shoulder more of the load, and so far that doesn’t seem like a bad thing. If you are in need of a starting quarterback or a capable backup, Hasselbeck is available in 81.5 percent of ESPN leagues.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41210\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41210\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/","id":3500,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[3499,3498,3497],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Legacy of Thomas M.

After graduating at the age of 22, he returned to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Although he had no prior experience in journalism, Storke quickly became involved in the newspaper business. He started out as a cub reporter, feeling his way through the business, but became a newspaper owner within a few short years.</p>\n<p>“In 1900, Tom Storke, aged 24, borrowed $2,000 to buy the Daily Independent, weakest of the town’s three papers,” an October 13, 1971 New York Times article reads. “He sold it in 1909 and went back into the business in 1913 as owner of the Santa Barbara Daily News. Not long afterward he reacquired the Independent and published the combined paper as the Daily News and Independent.”</p>\n<p>In 1932, Storke took yet another paper under his wing.</p>\n<p>“Thomas Storke, editor and publisher of the Santa Barbara  Daily News, faced a dilemma that seems positively alien in 2004,” Matt Welch wrote in a Reason.com article. “Storke’s competition, the 58-year-old Santa Barbara Morning Press, was on the brink of bankruptcy, and it begged him to take over as owner.”</p>\n<p>Thus, the Santa Barbara News-Press was born.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Storke of All Trades</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to journalism, Storke pursued work  in a variety of other fields. In 1938, he stepped up  in the place of Senator William Gibbs McAddoo  and served as a California senator for two months.  He founded the AM radio station KTMS, was a  member of the California Crime Commission from  1951 to 1952 and served as a University of California  regent from 1955 to 1960. He wrote two autobiographies, including California Editor.</p>\n<p>Storke was also instrumental in establishing  the Santa Barbara Airport, the man-made Lake  Cachuma and UC Santa Barbara. Under the college  land grant program, Storke used his political ties to  secure 900 coastal acres of the land UCSB stands on  today.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>California Editor</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 1961, Storke published a series of exposés identifying the John Birch Society — founded in the late  1950s and still active today as right-wing political  advocacy group — as a totalitarian organization.</p>\n<p>“My grandfather was basically a very kind and  gentle man,” Thomas Storke Cox, Storke’s grandson,  said in an e-mail. “However, he did not suffer fools  gladly and  he could only be pushed so far  before  striking back. That is what happened in the case of  the John Birch Society. … Once the Birchers went  after his close friend … he decided to return the favor  and go after them.”</p>\n<p>According to a May 23, 2011 Santa Barbara  Independent article by Michael Redmon, the Society  started out with only 11 members during the Cold  War but, by the early 1960s, had a membership of  nearly 100,000.</p>\n<p>“The primary purpose of the organization in this  period was to expose and root out what members  perceived to be the pervasive and dangerous influences of communism in all aspects of American life,”  the article reads.</p>\n<p>Among those under attack by the Society were  President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Storke’s  good friend and former Supreme Court Chief of  Justice Earl Warren, for whom the Earl Warren  Showgrounds are named.</p>\n<p>In response, the Santa Barbara News-Press  slammed the Society for its divisive attacks on  notable — and, in Storke’s opinion, undeserving —  political leaders.</p>\n<p>“During recent weeks, the News-Press has  sought to enlighten its readers about a semi-secret organization called the John Birch Society,” one of the editorials reads. “The News-Press condemns the destructive campaign of hate and vilification that the John Birch Society is waging against national leaders who deserve our respect and confidence. How can anyone follow a leader absurd enough to call former President Eisenhower ‘a dedicated conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy’?”</p>\n<p>In 1962, Storke was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing in addition to the Lauterbach Award by the Nieman Foundation of Harvard and the Elijah Lovejoy Fellowship for courageous journalism.</p>\n<p>Newspapers were one of Storke’s great life passions and though he sold the NewsPress in 1964, Storke remained editor and publisher emeritus.</p>\n<p>In a speech at the Annual Dinner Meeting of the California Press Association, Storke said, “I still say that the first responsibility of editors and publishers is to their own community. But, when the job is done well, its byproducts can become greater than the first objective.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“These bells ring for freedom…”</strong></p>\n<p>In 1969, Storke spoke at the official dedication for his namesake, Storke Tower, which he helped fund.</p>\n<p>“It is my hope that the publications coming from this building will be the finest examples of journalism developed on any campus in America — perhaps in the world,” Storke said. “Talented students are here. Brilliant faculty members are here. Working together, they can produce publications of national and international scope — for the enlightenment of civilized people everywhere.”</p>\n<p>The Daily Nexus student newspaper, La Cumbre yearbook and KCSB radio station have worked out of the offices under the tower for years.</p>\n<p>The building’s original pamphlet notes that the landmark soars 175 feet above the campus’ main-level and is the tallest structure in the entire county. Within the tower lies a 61-bell carillon, the only five-octave chromatic bell system in existence.</p>\n<p>On October 12 of 1971, just two years after the Storke Tower dedication, Thomas More Storke died after suffering a stroke.  He was 94 years old.</p>\n<p>Storke was survived by 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. The Davidson Library’s Special Collections alone has over 200 condolence letters, cards and telegrams sent to his widow within two weeks after his passing.</p>\n<p>According to Cox, few of today’s journalists exhibit the same fearlessness as his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“The whole concept of an ‘independent journalist’ à la my grandfather has become almost an anachronism in these days of the 24-hour news cycle, Facebook, Twitter, etc.,” he said. “Even the concept of an ‘independent newspaper’ has become almost quaint since the way things are now going there may not be a lot of ‘newspapers’ left in the future, let alone ones whose editorial policies are set by one dedicated individual as was the case of the Santa Barbara NewsPress fifty years ago.”</p>\n<p>Storke’s memory is alive in the bells that chime every hour on the hour. As a placard on Storke Tower reads, “These bells ring for the freedom of the press and in tribute to Editor-Publisher Thomas More Storke, whose affection for the University made this building possible.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/","id":3495,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3494,3493,3492],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"What’s A.S.

One person had heard of the plans, but knew no additional information.</p>\n<p>The respective projects both have running starts, but do they have what it takes to get off the ground?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Associated Students’ Sustainable Restaurant</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Associated Students plans to invest a quarter of a million dollars of student money to establish an organic, local food operation at 6521 Pardall Rd.</p>\n<p>The restaurant — which would take over the space of the now-defunct On The Side — would produce approximately 35 to 50 student jobs and, while it would create revenue, would not be run on a strictly profit-generating platform. Legislative Council representatives Fabian Gallardo and Stanley Tzankov, an A.S. presidential candidate, started pushing the enterprise last quarter.</p>\n<p>While delegates indicated that the $250,000 is being loaned out for the plan from a reserve account under the control of Business Services, as of press time, student representatives have given the Daily Nexus conflicting reports about the money’s source.</p>\n<p>The four students of the Business Services committee — including Gallardo, the committee chair — voted in favor of the loan, Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>“The reserve account was created in 2006 during the students’ initiative as a mandate for an environmental center,” Gallardo said. “A large focus of the restaurant will be towards environmental education, hence the strong involvement of the Student Food Collective.”</p>\n<p>However, A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, said the Business Services loan is coming from the A.S. Bike Reserve — funds that were allocated a number of years ago for the A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>Part of the $250,000 will be allocated to an outside individual recommended by the A.S. attorney to create a business plan with the rest going toward “holding down” a lease, said Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said there was a discussion about loaning against other A.S. accounts.</p>\n<p>“We currently have an account devoted towards the construction of a permanent bike shop, since our current one is in a trailer,” Elwood said. “It was proposed that we could borrow against that money once it came time to actually pay [for the restaurant]. But that was a possible suggestion, and it hasn’t been acted on. So once we know exactly how much money it will cost to get into this, we’ll be able to have a few options about where to pull the funding from if we decide to go for it.”</p>\n<p>Following the Business Services’ decision, the Associated Students Legislative Council approved the loan as a resolution, said Tzankov. However, during an in-person interview Tzankov said that the Legislative Council members “don’t always go through the minutes.”</p>\n<p>Because the restaurant has the potential to generate revenue, A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs Cori Lantz said the proponents moved forward without configuring a final budget.</p>\n<p>“I have mentioned it was hard for groups to fund money [for the annex project], and the groups are getting something out of it,” Lantz said. “I’m not sure where the money [for the restaurant] is going to come from. I’m not sure how they’re going to pull it off.”</p>\n<p>However, Rodriguez said the restaurant is not necessarily guaranteed to generate a surplus.</p>\n<p>“It has been calculated that the first year we will be breaking even but every year after that would be going to paying back the loan,” Rodriguez said. “This business isn’t designed to profit necessarily, but it’s designed to provide a service for students.”</p>\n<p>Tzankov confirmed that a budget is still in the works.</p>\n<p>“The restaurant has a lot of potential to generate a stable source of revenue,” Tzankov said. “The projections in our most current business plan are highly dependent on what menu we decide to craft in the following months and therefore, no accurate estimate can be provided at this time; however, that information will be public as soon as it is finalized.”</p>\n<p>Proponents of the café are currently looking into other sources of funds.</p>\n<p>“We have applied to several grants, including an $80,000 grant from The Green Initiative Fund that will go towards the production of the cart and improvements on the building and are pursuing more options from foundations and nonprofits,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>According to the café supporters, excess funds from the restaurant may be recycled back to A.S. — but plans are still up in the air.</p>\n<p>“This coming year, [the A.S.] budget is looking a lot tighter than it has been in the past,” Elwood said. “There have been a few reasons for that, but the base reason is that the university is not covering our benefits anymore, which increased our yearly costs about $400,000. It’s a big jump that we’ve never had to deal with. I’d imagine that [money from the restaurant] could go to back to the general fund that we distribute evenly throughout the association, but I don’t think it’s really been discussed.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For the past few years, the restaurants at 6521 Pardall Rd. have not done well. On The Side was open for about six months before turning over to Dirty’s Barbeque and Brew Shack, which Tzankov estimated was open a mere two months.</p>\n<p>However, Gallardo said the previous establishments’ losses can be attributed mostly to poor management.</p>\n<p>“From information provided to us about the last couple businesses we can tell that they were somewhat successful,” Gallardo said. “They weren’t necessarily losing money; they just weren’t making a lot.  A lot of these businesses that showed up weren’t locally managed, they were usually setup by investors from L.A. or SF.”</p>\n<p>Gallardo also said A.S. plans to physically change the building to attract customers.</p>\n<p>“We would like to open up the space more, allow more natural lighting, larger lounge areas and expansion of the outdoor patio with added photovoltaic solar panels,” Gallardo said. “We hope to change the current image of a ‘haunted building’ — read that in the Nexus a few days ago — to a much more livelier hangout spot for students.”</p>\n<p>Proponents remain optimistic about the restaurant’s potential. According to Gallardo, the restaurant will provide healthier food options than the average Isla Vista restaurant.</p>\n<p>“We will put into place as many sustainable practices for our restaurant at its opening as possible, and continually upgrade our facilities to fit the mission of an environmentally conscious business,” Gallardo said in an e-mail. “We hope to create precedent for future businesses in Isla Vista in both their quality of food and how they do business.”</p>\n<p>Gallardo said the sustainable café will act as an educational resource and local dig for the community.</p>\n<p>“It will provide students with a space to come in and hangout, relax, read a book — kind of something along the lines of what the Hub is supposed to be, but with the intimacy it lacks,” Gallardo said.</p>\n<p>Because of the restaurant’s structure, it would function differently than other I.V. establishments, Elwood said.</p>\n<p>“First of all, the model that it’s being built on is so that eventually, if it were to be successful, it would exist to support itself,” Elwood said. “It wouldn’t be interested in making a profit, per se. Because of that, the food and services that came from the business would be much more fairly priced than other places in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Rodriguez also said the space could be used for community events such as lectures, concerts or open mic nights.</p>\n<p>All legal documents for the lease have been submitted to the office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang and are waiting approval of the Chancellor and possibly the Regents, said Gallardo.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately we have to clear a lot more hurdles than the average person trying to open up their own business,” Gallardo said.</p>\n<p>Despite controversy surrounding this endeavor, Gallardo said, he “wouldn’t want to tell any student to do anything [he] knew for a fact they didn’t want.”</p>\n<p>“At this point, it has been students telling us through surveys done by both Associated Students and the Student Food Collective that this is what they want,” Gallardo said. “They’re tired of hamburgers and burritos. If I encountered a student who was not happy with our decision to pursue a sustainable café and somehow had to convince him/her otherwise, I’d start by showing them the statistical information on food options in IV and the dissatisfaction students are having.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Associated Students’ Community Annex</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The A.S. EVPLA’s office has fought alongside partner groups to establish an annex in Isla Vista, but now their plans are hanging in the balance.</p>\n<p>EVPLA Cori Lantz said she hopes that the community center will be established in the 4,270 square foot area above the I.V. Medical Clinic at 570 Embarcadero del Mar. The annex would house 15 boards, commissions and committees — nine of which currently have no office space at all.</p>\n<p>“In order to get this entire thing up and running” Lantz said the building will cost $82,060 per year. Approximately $51,250 is allocated for rent, with the remainder funding utilities, supplies and staff and student salaries.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like a huge number,” Lantz said. “But it’s actually very reasonable.”</p>\n<p>C.A.B. allocated $24,000 for the space and the IVCRC has promised that they will contribute $2,000 every month to the annex rent upon establishment.</p>\n<p>However, the project still needs $34,560. Lantz asked the A.S. Financial Board for money, but was turned down.</p>\n<p>“For reasons I’m not sure of, they decided it was too much money,” Lantz said. “Which is frustrating because there are one-day events that cost just as much [as funding the building for an entire year].”</p>\n<p>Lantz is now asking groups with surplus funds for this year to contribute to the community center fund.</p>\n<p>According to Lantz, many of the 15 groups that hope to move into the annex may not be able to continue their work if this space is not provided.</p>\n<p>“It is nearly impossible for groups to expand and grow without an office,” Lantz said. “This is not a luxury at this point, this is a necessity.”</p>\n<p>The annex would also house a number of other community amenities including a computer lab, community garden, space for off-campus representatives to hold office hours, a recreation room and a kitchen where C.A.B. could cook breakfasts for the homeless.</p>\n<p>According to IVCRC Chair Megan Shumate, her group is one of the project’s biggest supporters.</p>\n<p>“I have been involved in making sure this project is made a priority because there are several committees in Associated Students that do not have a space, and it makes it extremely difficult to help the committee grow and achieve all of its goals to their full potential,” Shumate said in an e-mail. “IVCRC has been one of the biggest supporters of the I.V. Annex because it not only gives us a solid place to meet and have an office, but it also gives us a chance to reach out to our community members, especially those which aren’t students.”</p>\n<p>However, money is not the only problem the annex supporters face.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of work to do before we can make it a reality,” Elwood said. “I think that the idea of it is fantastic, but there have been a lot of hurdles getting there. Right now, it’s hard for me to say whether it will happen.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang recently mandated that A.S. needs to get approval from the UC Regents before signing any new lease in Isla Vista. Furthermore, Governor Brown’s current budget proposal calls for the dissolution of all Redevelopment Agencies in California. If this happens, the local Redevelopment Agency — which is responsible for the Isla Vista Master Plan and manages the annex property — may no longer exist.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are about 10 groups that allocate money from property taxes. Without the Redevelopment Agency, there would only be nine groups that, according to Lantz, are less savvy on fighting for Isla Vista improvements.</p>\n<p>“We would still be paying into property taxes, but getting nothing out of it,” Lantz said. “Any type of fiscal improvement [in Isla Vista] comes from the RDA.”</p>\n<p>Originally, A.S. planned to move into the building in the beginning of March. Now, Lantz says, the project cannot progress until sometime in early June after the next UC Regents meeting.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the tentative plans for the Anisq’ Oyo’ Master Plan redevelopment include expanding the park by tearing down a number of buildings including Rosarito, Naan Stop, the St. Athanasius Orthodox Church — and the space that Lantz hopes will be used for the annex.</p>\n<p>“I have had some reservations as we’ve moved forward,” EVPLA County Liaison and A.S. EVPLA candidate Tim Benson said in an e-mail. “I question the timing of the investment since the building is scheduled to be torn down within the next two years, and we face a likely chance of being kicked out of the building as soon as November.”</p>\n<p>Another question is whether the annex will be fully utilized by the students. According to Benson, A.S. does need to become more visible to the student population, but he is unsure of whether the annex would be the best option.</p>\n<p>“The genesis of putting an A.S. space in Isla Vista was the idea that a majority of UCSB students live in I.V. and a majority of their time is spent in I.V., so an annex in I.V. would be a great stride in making a more accessible and more visible association,” Benson said. “However, we could run into the same overarching issue of student apathy. We shouldn’t fund a large project if students won’t utilize it. I question how visible the building will be as it is tucked behind a row of businesses.”</p>\n<p>Despite the setbacks, Lantz said she and others would continue supporting the project.</p>\n<p>“We are still moving forward,” Lantz said. “We are looking into alternative spaces, but none would be as good. We’re going to continue fighting for that space.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36225\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36225\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/","id":3580,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3579,3578,3577],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Recount Egypt’s Revolt","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“About 10,000 people were in Tahrir Square,” Jeremy Hodge, a fourth-year Middle Eastern studies major, said. “I eventually got drawn into the front and got exposed to tear gas.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“About 10,000 people were in Tahrir Square,” Jeremy Hodge, a fourth-year Middle Eastern studies major, said. “I eventually got drawn into the front and got exposed to tear gas.

Following the release of a U.S. State Dept. travel advisory for the area, the students had their studies cut short and were relocated temporarily to Barcelona on Feb. 1. They were a semester into their year-long program at the American University in Cairo — located about 45 minutes by car from Tahrir Square. Since their evacuation, three of the students returned to California, while two opted to transfer to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>This is their story:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>The “Rage Revolution” Begins</strong></p>\n<p>Spurred by mass protests in Tunisia that led to the overthrow of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, demonstrations erupted across the Middle East, sparking in Egypt on Jan. 25. Tens of thousands of protesters assembled in Cairo that day, demanding the end of President Mubarak’s regime.</p>\n<p>UCSB students Hodge and Sophie Tahran along with alumnus Brendan Geck were present in Tahrir Square for the first day of protests. Geck and Hodge were rooming together near Tahrir Square on the island of Zamalek and initially intended to watch the protests from afar.

Thousands of people then began rushing the police. Geck was hit with rubber pellets when he approached the protesters to take pictures of the scene.</p>\n<p>Hodge said he was stunned that Egyptians were so resolute in their demands.</p>\n<p>“I was shocked by the Egyptians’ courage and ability to pull this off, as up until now most people, including myself and most Egyptians, had characterized Egyptians as incredibly apathetic,” Hodge said in a Facebook message. “Until all this, that was kind of their reputation in the Middle East amongst other Arab nationalities.”</p>\n<p>Dalia Ziada, an Egyptian human rights activist and outreach director for the American Islamic Congress, said she was happy to discover the strength of her countrymen.</p>\n<p>“Before the protests started, we were hopeful, but never thought that it would come true,” Ziada said from Egypt via Skype. “On the first day, everyone was surprised by the huge number of crowds. There are so many people that tend to be passive. Now there are no passive people anymore.”</p>\n<p>Hodge said the country’s volatile economic and political climate, brusquely handled by the same dictator for three decades, had steeped tensions among the Egyptian people.</p>\n<p>“In addition to the fact that there is high unemployment caused by the fact that after graduating from college … they are unable to find jobs because most people attain degrees in useless fields such as [pharaonic] history (in Egypt, the government chooses your major based off some test), high food prices and ridiculously high levels of corruption — politically the last round of parliamentary elections were more rigged than usual,” he said.</p>\n<p><strong>“Day of Revolt”</strong></p>\n<p>Three days in, protests took a drastically violent turn. With media reporting over 20 protesters killed that day and dozens more injured, the Egyptian military felt compelled to intervene.</p>\n<p>“It started to look more like a war zone,” Geck said. “The military stepped in on Friday [Jan. 28]. That’s when the prospect of a revolution began to be possible.”</p>\n<p>That same day, the government blocked internet access and cell phone service to the majority of the country.</p>\n<p>Tahran, a third-year global studies major, witnessed pandemonium on the fourth day of demonstrations. She visited Tahrir Square as she returned from the train station that day and found herself trapped. Tahran said she tried to leave the square as struggles escalated between protesters and police, but her exit routes were blocked.</p>\n<p>“I tried to get on the metro and my stop wasn’t working,” she said in a webcam interview. “I went to another stop and that wasn’t functioning either. Police were blocking the bridge that would allow me to get home. As we walked closer we saw that the protesters were assembled near my block.”</p>\n<p>As tear gas spread through the air, creating clouds of white billowing smoke, she and her friend hurried to find another way to their off-campus apartment.</p>\n<p>“Tear gas was being blown by the wind toward us,” she said. “We were luckily able to cross another bridge. We found a cab driver who was willing to take us home through the back streets.”</p>\n<p>Tahran said she saw authorities being carried away by protesters and an apartment lit on fire, undercut with a current of tear gas.</p>\n<p>“It was mostly just people fainting because of the tear gas,” she said. “We were 300 feet away [from] the conflict and the tear gas was still affecting us.”</p>\n<p>As Tahran and a friend struggled to get to their apartment, Geck, Hodge and their friend were escorted out of the conflict zone and sent away on a river boat by police officers. Hodge said Egyptian authorities were concerned that the American students would take pictures or cause international repercussions.</p>\n<p>Hodge’s group sought shelter on the fourth floor of the Ramses Hilton, providing them a vantage point of the protests. However, Hodge said, the tear gas was so strong that the hotel staff forced observers off the pool deck and barricaded the hotel — locking everyone in.</p>\n<p>Geck was separated from the group during the commotion and blocked outside the hotel. As he stumbled to find refuge, Geck said he witnessed police throwing rocks at protesters and lighting cars on fire to frame demonstrators. While dodging Molotov cocktails, he eventually found a parking lot to take shelter, struggling against pervasive tear gas.</p>\n<p>“I had probably the worst experience of tear gas from the whole trip,” he said. “I felt pinned down for a second, then found a parking garage.”</p>\n<p>Geck said he never feared for his life; he was afraid of getting arrested while hiding out in the garage.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t see, I didn’t know what was going on,” Geck said. “I had heard people say that the police were coming. That’s when you run the risk of getting arrested.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, protesters broke through the barricade and rushed into the Ramses Hilton.</p>\n<p>“They were peaceful though and mostly were just there to rest and recover from the violence which was directly outside,” Hodge said. “Throughout the day tear gas seeped into the hotel which we all eventually became used to and by 10:30 [p.m.] it was safe for us to walk home again as the protesters had beaten off the cops when they got help from the army who diffused the situation.”</p>\n<p>As soon as he learned that the army had stepped in to protect the Egyptian people, Geck said he knew that protest had become revolution.</p>\n<p><strong>The Jan. 29 and Jan. 30 Demonstrations</strong></p>\n<p>Geoff Cloepfil, a fourth-year linguistics major, said the entire square and all of its connecting streets were filled with people and military tanks on Jan. 29, although armed forces reportedly defied Mubarak’s orders to open fire on unarmed protesters.</p>\n<p>“People were standing on top of tanks waving flags and shouting anti-Mubarak slogans,” Cloepfil said. “At one point I saw an army officer lifted to shoulder level, parading through the square while leading people in a chant. At that point everything was still peaceful, despite the scent of tear gas still in the air from the previous day. We were evacuated … before things turned really violent.”</p>\n<p>Most service members and police officers left the city the following day, prompting the community to close all businesses and assemble neighborhood watches for looters.</p>\n<p>“The thing that affected me most was how people were able to come together,” Tahran said. “For a few days there was no authority at all. People stepped out to the plate and took charge. … All the men on my street stood out all night with kitchen utensils, protecting their property [and] family.”</p>\n<p>Hodge said there were only three bridges to Zamalek island where he, Geck, Tahran and Cloepfil lived, making it easily defensible.</p>\n<p>“At each bridge there were checkpoints manned by about 100 men, most of whom had long metal poles or machetes, but some of whom had AK-47’s and bulletproof vests,” he said via Facebook. “After curfew (4 p.m.) no women would be seen out on the streets, only these armed men, who depending on the day wear either white or yellow armbands as a way of identifying themselves as being from Zamalek.”</p>\n<p>While students living in off-campus dorms or apartments in Zamalek were located near the heart of the protests, the rest of the student body was more removed from the conflict. Still, Elise Bell, a third-year cultural anthropology major, was living on-campus at the American University in Cairo and said she felt the revolution’s impact trickle down to the university.</p>\n<p>“It started getting difficult getting food and water,” Bell said. “The dorms never ran out of food, but there were hour-and-a-half long lines in the supermarket. Everyone was hoarding food, in case they weren’t allowed to leave.”</p>\n<p>Bell was visiting her family in California when the protests first erupted during the university’s winter break. She returned to Cairo two days after the protests, but was evacuated to Barcelona shortly after.</p>\n<p>Vivian Chui, a third-year Middle Eastern studies major, on the other hand, was out of Egypt during the whole incident.</p>\n<p>Chui said she was supposed to return to Cairo on Jan. 28 before her spring semester commenced on Jan. 31, but cancelled her flight as the protests became more violent.</p>\n<p>She remained with her host family in Beirut, where she was traveling during the break.</p>\n<p><strong>Leaving Egypt</strong></p>\n<p>Many of the students didn’t find out about their mandatory evacuation until hours before their scheduled flight on Feb. 1.</p>\n<p>“We were pulled from Egypt completely out of the blue,” Tahran said. “I literally got a call at 3 in the morning and got picked up at 9.”</p>\n<p>Cloepfil said he was upset by the call to evacuate.</p>\n<p>“I was in Egypt during a revolution,” he said. “I wanted to experience it. I tried everything I could to convince them to let me stay, but in the end didn’t get to have a choice.”</p>\n<p>After being pulled from Egypt, the students were allowed to choose whether they wanted to return to the U.S. or transfer to Israel, Turkey, Korea or Germany, to continue their studies.</p>\n<p>Tahran said she had only 10 minutes to choose a destination. While she and Hodge chose Jerusalem, Cloepfil selected Korea. However, visa complications prevented him from travelling to Seoul. Bell and Chui returned to California and Geck decided to leave Egypt on Feb. 8 to join his friends and accept a job opportunity in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>As the students left Cairo, officers and “thugs” dressed in street clothes reportedly attempted to scare protesters into submission. Posing as supporters of the regime, some pro-Mubarak forces reportedly traveled on camel and horseback while firing live ammunition at anti-government protesters.</p>\n<p><strong>“Free at Last”</strong></p>\n<p>After 18 days of protests, Mubarak resigned from office on Feb. 11 and transferred power to the Supreme Council of Egyptian Armed Forces. The interim government has since appointed a committee of legal experts to amend the Egyptian constitution so that it includes term limits on the presidency and regulates government power.</p>\n<p>Presidential elections are prospectively scheduled for August.</p>\n<p>Geck said he was elated by the news of Mubarak’s resignation. However, he was also upset to miss the historic event by a mere 28 hours.</p>\n<p>Hodge said he originally thought that day would never come.</p>\n<p>“With regards to Hosni Mubarak’s resignation, if you had asked me the day before the protests began, or even a week after they had got under way if I thought it would ever happen, I would have said no,” he said on Feb. 14. “However, lately, especially in the last week, I came to expect this more and more.”</p>\n<p>Bell said she was surprised that Mubarak stepped down without a larger fight.</p>\n<p>“I thought he would hold out longer,” Bell said. “I really thought he would hold out until they physically removed him from the country.”</p>\n<p>Although happy, Cloepfil said he is concerned for the country’s future.</p>\n<p>“The majority of Egyptians I talked to wanted Mubarak to step down immediately, but had no idea of where to go from there,” Cloepfil said. “In this sort of situation, it’s so easy for another dictator to just fill the vacuum.”</p>\n<p>Chui said she couldn’t help but adopt the Egyptian people’s cynicism about their government after her time in the country.</p>\n<p>“Walking around the first night, police officers would roam street corners with large rifles,” Chui said. “It was never on the actual news, but I heard that someone was tortured in a police station. … As a foreigner, they treat you so well, but not when you’re an Egyptian.”</p>\n<p>Although a final death count has not been announced, Egyptian Health Minister Ahmed Sameh Farid estimated on Feb. 23 that 384 people died and 6,467 sustained injuries during the 18-day conflict between civilians and police forces.<br>\nDespite this startling statistic, the demonstrations have been described as largely non-violent in nature.</p>\n<p>Ziada, who has participated in numerous women’s rights movements, said Egyptian society has a long history of struggling for equality amidst injustice.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised with how [the protesters] were tolerant in dealing with other groups,” Ziada said. “Although we were complaining about sexual corruption to women, there were thousands of women and thousands of men and they never got harassed. This was due to the government suppression of people.”</p>\n<p>A strong proponent of non-violent reform, Ziada translated an American comicbook about Martin Luther King Jr.’s peaceful protests in Montgomery, Alab. into Arabic. Ziada and other activists distributed these comics in Tahrir Square to discourage violence. Aside from promoting peace, the pamphlets also allowed activists to reach protestors at a time when the government was censoring media outlets.</p>\n<p>“We found great difficulty [publishing the book],” Ziada said. “Security forces here didn’t want us to have it printed. We were distributing it everywhere in the country, the Middle East as well. We give training on how to use nonviolent tactics in breaking down a dictator.”</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>\n<p>Whether they chose to travel abroad in Egypt to enrich their Arabic language skills, study Middle Eastern relations or simply live in one of the world’s most culturally and historically rich countries, the students present during the protests watched history unfold before their eyes. Regardless of what lessons they took with them, the students said they would never forget the Egyptian people, whom they described as compassionate, hospitable and joyful.</p>\n<p>“We learned about the lack of political process that exists, the type of underlying conflict that exists when people are unable to express themselves through elections,” Geck said. “I had never seen people that excited, that passionate.”</p>\n<p>As they witnessed the collapse of a dictatorship and learned about the slew of revolts that erupted in the Middle East as a result, the students said they fully grasped their generation’s ability to initiate change.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34324\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-01/students-recount-egypts-revolt-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34324\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-01/students-recount-egypts-revolt-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-01/students-recount-egypts-revolt-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-01/students-recount-egypts-revolt-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-01/students-recount-egypts-revolt-2/","id":3522,"author":{"id":334,"name":"Maane Khatchatourian"},"related":[3521,3520,3519],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Bucket List","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"We are midway through the eighth week of Winter Quarter, which means two things: One: Spring is in the air and the sun will soon be out in true Santa Barbara fashion, and … Two: Many of you are near...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>We are midway through the eighth week of Winter Quarter, which means two things: One: Spring is in the air and the sun will soon be out in true Santa Barbara fashion, and … Two: Many of you are nearing the conclusion of your undergraduate careers.</p>\n<p>The time is now to do everything you have always wanted to at UCSB. Don’t worry, I won’t be cheesy and yammer on about “carpe diem,” but the clock is definitely ticking and there is still a lot for you to accomplish. If you are not sure where to start, never fear.

I probably learned more during my five months abroad than during my entire undergraduate career at UCSB.</p>\n<p>I enrolled in unique courses, traveled throughout Ghana and Togo, volunteered at a refugee camp, taught English at a local school, wrote regularly for the Nexus’ Daily Nexog, tried a slew of new food and met many lifelong friends.</p>\n<p>Whether you decide to go to Europe or Asia and whether you leave for a summer or an entire year, studying abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Travel opportunities will present themselves throughout your life, but you may never get another chance to literally live somewhere else — and, trust me, living somewhere is vastly different than just visiting for a couple weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Lean How to Surf, editor-in-chief Elliott Rosenfeld</strong></p>\n<p>I hear it all the time in Isla Vista. Someone will wistfully watch from their balcony as their fellow students dance on the waves below and exhale with a sigh, “I wish I could surf.”</p>\n<p>Well, you can. The most daunting obstacle to getting in the water is overcoming your fear of starting the whole process. But, once you try it, surfing is a simple pleasure. All it takes is perseverance to become adept at riding a board.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to start, too. You can find a buddy who surfs to teach you, join a local surf camp or even get bold, buy a board, throw yourself into the waves and teach yourself.</p>\n<p>Just make sure to brush up on your swimming skills before you head into the water, and make sure you have someone with you if you’re beginner. The ocean is unpredictable — while it can be fun, remember to never turn your back to the sea.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Sleep (with someone) on the beach, county editors Garik Hauer, Erika Martin and Madison Mederios</strong></p>\n<p>We have lived by the ocean our entire lives, but only since moving to Isla Vista have we realized that the beach is so much more than a place to surf or tan. Spice up the typical weekend “grind” and venture down onto the sand to enjoy the ocean’s stellar ambience. Look up the next meteor shower for an extra passionate night of romance with your special someone or a one-night stand you’ll never forget. Oh, and don’t forget to bring a couple blankets or a sleeping bag.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Take a Trip …  in your mind, opinion editors Nadia Ismail and Steven Begakis</strong></p>\n<p>College is about experimentation, exploration and learning how to use literary devices other than alliterations. Luckily, taking drugs falls into the first two categories and can aid in all kinds of soul-searching and mind-bending.</p>\n<p>We’re not talking about the hard stuff. We’re not talking about drug abuse. But we are talking about smoking a bowl with a great group of friends and just chilling. And thinking about your role in the universe, or whatever. Psychotropic drugs are great too — just use with care.  UCSB is a liberal campus and it’s almost a shame to not explore altered states of consciousness while it’s still accepted by your peers. Your mind is the last frontier, and we think it’d be a cool thing to check it out before checking out of UCSB.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Play Bocce Ball, sports editors Ravi Bhatia and Mark Bogard</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking of smoking a bowl … roast one with your buds and go play Bocce Ball at one of the Del Playa parks, preferably the one with the green grass and hilly terrain between the 6500 and 6600 blocks. It will cure your Saturday hangover and allow you to be both lazy and competitive at the same time. You can buy your own bocce ball set for 22 bucks on Amazon.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Eat … Everywhere!, layout editor Amanda Hill</strong></p>\n<p>What better way is there to experience every aspect of UCSB than through food?</p>\n<p>Everyone and their mom knows about Freebirds, as the quesarito and monster burrito are surely two of mankind’s greatest inventions, yet few people know the greatness of the Arbor’s hot dog stand. There are countless other great restaurants at our disposal. By the time I graduate I want to say I’ve tried the fare from every local eatery. Maybe I’ll even find something even — gasp — better than Freebirds.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Go on an Adventure With UCSB’s Adventure Programs, university editors Maane Khatchatourian, Jenna Ryan and Katherine Friedman</strong></p>\n<p>The university’s Adventure Programs is certain to help you fulfill more than one item on your bucket list. The program offers everything from canoeing down the Colorado River,  to backpacking through Yosemite Valley to going scuba diving in the Channel Islands. However, we think the best extreme sport offered by the department is paragliding.</p>\n<p>UCSB Adventure Programs and Eagle Paragliding collaborate to provide thrill-seekers a paragliding lesson once almost every month. The class is available to anyone between 17-75 years of age — regardless of experience level — and costs $175 for students and $200 for nonstudents. Although it’s a steep charge, you can’t put a price tag on realizing your childhood dream of flying.</p>\n<p>The adventure begins at Elings Park in downtown Santa Barbara. It then takes flight, providing paragliders with views of the Pacific Ocean and Santa Ynez Mountains. Riders ultimately land on a hill and return to the startling line to relive the journey again.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Audit a Class, copy editor Nader Heidari</strong></p>\n<p>It is difficult to think of something that one must do before they leave UCSB that does not involve sex, intoxicants or dubstep. It may take a while to discover, but past the hazy paradise of I.V. life, there exists a university. Not just any one, mind you, but a damn good one, employing professors that tend to be at least somewhat renowned in their area of study.</p>\n<p>Now, before you begin the mantra of “NERD,” let me remind you that our campus has a course on porn. Furthermore, you are sitting in on classes you are NOT enrolled in. That means no papers, no midterms. No time-vampiric assignments. No forced attendance. Basically, all the awesome parts of classes without all of the stress-inducing, GPA-destroying gauntlets you usually have to run to grab a few units.</p>\n<p>Of course, make sure you aren’t keeping a seat from a person who is actually enrolled in the class, and clear it with the professor first. Don’t be that guy who takes up space and just surfs Facebook the entire time. No one likes that guy. Not even his 56 Facebook friends.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Take a Moment to Check Out the View, photo editors Aaron LaRue and John Kopecky</strong></p>\n<p>We as photographers are utterly spoiled living in Santa Barbara. With the Santa Ynez Mountains, the Pacific Ocean and the vibrant local culture, there’s always a “kodak moment” at hand. But regardless of how many great sunsets you’ve shot from DP, anyone who considers him/herself a visual stimulation addict (as we do ourselves) can not leave Santa Barbara without putting in a little more effort.</p>\n<p>If you drive up the 154 and take East Camino Cielo for about 20 minutes of 180 degree switchbacks — not for those with weak stomachs — you’ll find yourself at the top of the Santa Ynez Mountains with a breathtaking panoramic view of all of Santa Barbara. To make it more interesting, check out Knapp’s Castle — the ruins of an old hunting lodge easily accessible via trail near the top.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/bucket-list/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/bucket-list/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/bucket-list/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/bucket-list/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/bucket-list/","id":3521,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3520,3519,3518],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Love Affair With Ink","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There’s no doubt that tattoos have meaning.

He interviewed hundreds for his 2008 book “Permanence: Tattoo Portraits” in search of what inspires people to embody their stories in ink.</p>\n<p>“My work has always been about identity,” Fulbeck said. “I’m not interested in the actual tattoo. I’m more interested in why they do what they do.”<br>\nIn all of his travels, Fulbeck said the only constant has been that everyone has their own different reasons for getting inked.</p>\n<p>J.J. Ortiz, one of the owners of downtown Santa Barbara’s 805 Ink, discovered his love for the art at a young age when he saw some older men tattooing in a backyard.<br>\nHe was hooked. The sound of the needles, the time spent with his neighborhood friends and the chance to be creative were addicting.</p>\n<p>“[Tattooing] didn’t look that hard,”  Ortiz said with a laugh. “I did my first tattoo on this girl in junior high. She wanted a “J” for this guy she liked, and they actually ended up getting married. It wasn’t good at all, but that was the beginning.”</p>\n<p>[media-credit id=20169 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"969699489\" data-slb-group=\"33472\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/cbf_16feb2011_tattoofeature-007/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?fit=2700%2C780&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2700,780\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1297743431\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature 007\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?fit=250%2C72&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?fit=888%2C257&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007-250x72.jpg?resize=250%2C72\" alt=\"\" title=\"cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature 007\" width=\"250\" height=\"72\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33476\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?resize=250%2C72&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?resize=1024%2C296&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]Ortiz graduated high school, breezed through SBCC with straight A’s, received his bachelor’s degree and was set to be a teacher. But the itch to ink was persistent and soon he started working as an apprentice.</p>\n<p>“It’s constantly a learning process,” Jay said. “Every day is learning. Every tattoo counts.”</p>\n<p><em>And each person involved in the process counts. Every artist has a different forte; every customer a different vision.</em></p>\n<p>In his travels, Fulbeck said he noticed that some tattoos show obvious evidence of foresight while some seem more spur-of-the-moment. Some, like Amy Romeo, a second-year biopsychology major, incorporate their own designs and enduring life experiences into their work — as opposed to the much teased ‘tramp stamp’ effect.<br>\nRomeo creates her own artwork and recently started tattooing her friends. She illustrated the tattoo on her back, which pictures her ribcage as if layers of skin had been peeled back with a zipper, before it was inked by a tattoo artist.</p>\n<p>“[The drawing] was originally for my concentration portfolio in high school for my AP art class,” Romeo said. “We had to come up with a theme and a lot of my artwork ended up coming out with anatomy. I’ve always liked human anatomy; I find it fascinating.”</p>\n<p>These different ‘schools of tattooing,’ Fulbeck said, were evident across the globe.</p>\n<p>“There are those who get tattoos without putting much thought into what they want,” Fulbeck said. “Some people end up liking them, and some don’t. [The tattoos serve] as a scar on your body, kind of showing who you were at that time. It’s like a historical roadmap. Then there is the second school of people who wait and wait and wait and do their research, get to know different artists and then get the tattoo.”</p>\n<p>In Japan, he met several artists who emphasized the importance of the relationship between the tattoo artist and the tattooee. Fulbeck met Horitaka — now a close friend and the author of the foreword to “Permanence” — who introduced him to Horiyoshi III, the most renowned Japanese tattoo artist alive. In fact, Horiyoshi III gave Fulbeck a tattoo.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”PHOTO COURTESY OF Nicole Rogers” align=”alignleft” width=”199″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1219229395\" data-slb-group=\"33472\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33478\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/nicole/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg?fit=1008%2C1263&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1008,1263\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPhone\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1249075440\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"nicole\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg?fit=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg?fit=817%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole-199x250.jpg?resize=199%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"nicole\" width=\"199\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33478\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]“I think, especially in Japanese style, you have to have a relationship with the artist — you really have to synchronize,” Fulbeck said. “There is a tremendous amount of trust involved. I have an original piece of art on my back that burns with me after I die. I’m always indebted to Horiyoshi III for the work he did.”<br>\nWhen he came back from Japan, Fulbeck said, the prevalence of tattoo shops in the U.S. seemed to show a slightly more pop-culture tinge to American ink.<br>\nNonetheless, hordes of tattoo artists treat their craft with a seriousness matching the permanency of their art.<br>\nPat Fish of Santa Barbara-based LuckyFish Tattoo, a specialist in Celtic art, says she invests her time heavily into each tattoo assignment to connect on an individual level with each client.</p>\n<p>“I do a lot of research and find out what’s really meaningful to you,” Fish said. “Say you wanted a bird. If it came to it, I would go to the Natural History Museum to find the exact bird you wanted.”</p>\n<p>According to Fish, the majority of her clientele has been with her for 26 years, and respects her mastery of the tattoo so much that individuals will fly out from various parts of the world to get a new tat.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to do an art form that was a craft, and had immediate connection with the client,” Fish said. “No art gallery, no publisher, just me and the person for whom I was creating the art. I saw tattoos as having an ineluctable savor, providing a sign more permanent than almost anything else in life.”</p>\n<p>Fish said she takes the tattoo process seriously because of her personal values.</p>\n<p>“I’m really moral,” Fish said. “I believe I’m responsible for what I do in this life. If I’m putting a piece of art on [someone’s] back, it’s got to be good — I can’t have that bad karma. I do the best I can to be the agent of completion — people come to me with an idea, and I complete it.”</p>\n<p><em>The great thing about tattoos is that each one has its own flavor — a personalized blend of artist and recipient. Sometimes, a third party inspires or draws a tattoo before it is even taken to the artist to be inked.  Also the musculature of every human body varies enough that each tattoo is unlikely to ever be repeated.</em></p>\n<p>“The canvas is constantly moving,” Fulbeck said.</p>\n<p>Ali Obsorne, a second-year environmental studies major, said her tattoo placement was inspired by the nature of her design.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”PHOTO COURTESY OF Sonni Johnson” align=”alignleft” width=”152″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2043953081\" data-slb-group=\"33472\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33480\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/sonni2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?fit=847%2C1390&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"847,1390\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"sonni2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?fit=152%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?fit=624%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2-152x250.jpg?resize=152%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"sonni2\" width=\"152\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33480\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?resize=152%2C250&amp;ssl=1 152w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?resize=624%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?w=847&amp;ssl=1 847w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]“It’s a redwood leaf and I got it to symbolize where I grew up, which is Humboldt County, and we are famous for our redwood trees,” Osborne said. “I got it on my shoulder because I wanted it to look like it fell on my shoulder.

When I got to college, I wanted a symbol to remind myself about everything I was going through and how amazing the projects made me feel.”</p>\n<p>Some, like fourth-year communication major Angela Chandra who has an Ohm symbol on her side, see tattoos as a form of spiritual expression.</p>\n<p>“The symbol itself stands for truth love and divinity, and the balance between the awakened state and the dream state and it also captures the sound of the universe,” she said. “I knew I wanted one for a really long time.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33472\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33472\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/","id":3523,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3522,3521,3520],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Valentine’s Day: For Love or Lust?","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"So what’s thepremise of thisholiday again?

A littlenaked flying cherub babyis shooting harmless peoplewith a medieval war weapon toconfuse their sense of free willin commemoration of an entirelyunrelated Greek Orthodox traditionbased on the name of some saint? Yeah,fuck it, let’s celebrate. And while we’rerejoicing in our passions and love for ourcompanions, everyone else can just grab a tubof petroleum jelly and alternate between fits ofdepression and masturbation all day. Okay, beforewe get too cynical here about doves and rose petalsand gooey chocolate, I think it’s time we turned thatlonely-heart’s frown, upside-down.In the magical kingdom of Isla Vista, Valentine’sDay is an equal opportunity holiday. We can allhave our stupid heart-shaped expression candy andeat it too. I mean honestly, those littlesweethearts are quite theconversation starter inand of themselves. It’slike a cheaper wayto booty-call textthat also tastesdelicious— “kissm e , ”“ h o tstuff,” “sof i n e . ”It’s toogood not totake advantageof in some vulgar,offensive way.The following is a two-partguide to easy and fun ways to makeValentine’s Day well, easy and fun, whether you’rehitched or flying solo. Remember, Choose Your OwnAdventure books?If you want to see how to make the person you areexclusively sleeping with smile, go to option 1.If you want to see how to take advantage of the inevitableself-consciousness and loneliness this day spurns and casuallysleep with someone, go to option 2.1) Lovers, this is a day to rejoice and revel in yourmelting heart and regular lay. It’s a day to spoil yourmate and get spoiled back with yummy kisses anddiamonds and yachts. And of course, it’s a day tomake sweet, passionate love to your beau. So yourrapidly increasing college education fees are gettingin the way of buying that special gift? Well Yudof,you can ruin our bank account statements but youcan’t keep us from our romance!The beauty of love is, when it’s real, it can bedone and enjoyed on a budget. In the midst of aneconomic recession, there’s nothing more romanticthan thoughts from the heart — seriously. Writedown how you feel and seal it with a kiss, snuggle upand watch your favorite movies all night, relive yourfirst date or your first sexual experience together, meltdown some cheap chocolate for some yum and somefun. Keep it real boys, that’s all she wants. And girls,show him what you love so much about him and whyyou find him so sexy. Oh, and lingerie wouldn’t hurt.2) Ah yes, the party-of-one crowd. Well, you maynot be getting a box of chocolates or a love poem thisyear. But hey, love is in the air, so go outside andtake a whiff. I’m not saying you should be creepyand go out on the prowl for sad loners, but thebeautiful thing about Valentine’s Day is it remindsus of how nice it is to have someone to hold, andthe person you’re holding doesn’t have to be “theone” for you to feel good.Being single is fun and you can’t let this day makeyou forget that. I’ll be taking my valentine Mr. Vibratorout on a private date between my legs, and I’m notashamed of that. Couples get one day of the year to becute and sexy and romantic, and we singles get 364 toact randomly on our horny urges. Now I’m not usuallythe biggest advocate for having a fuck buddy, but comeon people, it’s V-Day! Find someone to hate love with;it may not be romantic but it sure as hell will be hot.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36816\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36816\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/","id":3537,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[3536,3535,3534],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":6,"route":"/categories/news/feature","highestPage":9}},"__N_SSG":true}
