One of them was the 2006 NCAA Division I National Coach of the Year—a.k.a., UCSB’s very own head coach, Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg’s familiarity with Cal Poly dates back to 1985 when he began playing collegiate soccer for UCSB. Now into his 20th year at the helm of the soccer program, the seasoned coach is able to look back at 30+ years of match-ups and observe the evolution of the rivalrous nature between the programs.</p>\n<p>“We’ve always had kind of a natural rivalry against them because of the location and distance. Even back when I played, it was always a game that we used to always want to play,” Vom Steeg reflects.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s program, however, never quite matched the level of Santa Barbara’s. Before officially meeting UCSB in Big West Conference play in 1996, it made its way through Division II and did not enter Division I until 1994.</p>\n<p>Preoccupied with their in-conference battle with Cal State Northridge for top-seed, the Gauchos paid little attention to the Mustangs’ entering. Vom Steeg recalls, “When they joined Big West…we didn’t think much about Cal Poly.” He acknowledges that Santa Barbara’s “general success” over them fed into the maturing feud.</p>\n<p>Upon the series of events in 2007 as aforementioned, however, the rivalry escalated to a level beyond prediction.</p>\n<p>Over the years, it has materialized into packed stadiums and rowdy crowds, distasteful screaming of ironic slogans like “Cuck Fal Poly”, and an ungodly amount of tortillas thrown-to-waste.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg carefully makes an important distinction between how the UCSB-Cal Poly rivalry takes form at Alex. G. Spanos Stadium versus that at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“The fans up at Cal Poly…are there mainly to…have a big party. They turn it…a little bit more into just an event that you get a bunch of people together and scream and yell,” he states matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>For a number of reasons, traveling to Cal Poly is hardly an enjoyable experience for the team. The close quartered football-turned-soccer field subjects them to audible criticisms from thousands of hovering fans.</p>\n<p>Up in SLO, Vom Steeg continues, “The referees are usually more emotional. The last two years we’ve had water bottles thrown at us. If you happen to lose the game, [the fans] jump over the side…It’s really hard to play naturally [and]…easy to make it hard to play soccer.”</p>\n<p>Silencing the infamous crowd remains one of his most memorable moments at Spanos Stadium. In 2009, senior Chris Pontius scored seconds into double overtime to win the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“The whole place was just absolutely quiet. Chris ran around the whole stadium, we were chasing him as he was celebrating, and the whole place was dead quiet,” he gladly recounted.</p>\n<p>In the coach’s eyes, Harder Stadium harbors a much more authentic environment for the team. The professional-like layout opens up the field while separating the players from the overwhelming crowds.</p>\n<p>He mostly appreciates the fans’—comprised of both students and locals—knowledge of the actual game, noting, “It feels like a soccer game. The cheering is about good plays on the field,” as compared to screaming about the opponent’s mistakes.</p>\n<p>This aspect, among others, was one of the driving factors in Vom Steeg’s decision in 1999 to take control of a struggling program that had, in the season prior to his arrival, merely two wins and 17 losses to its name.</p>\n<p>Ironically, Vom Steeg’s first time coaching UCSB was against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>20 years later, the accomplished coach has deep-rooted ties to Santa Barbara and holds some of the biggest accolades in collegiate soccer.</p>\n<p>He is a two-time NCSAA National Coach of the Year and a five-time Big West Coach of the Year. Under the reigns of Vom Steeg, UCSB made it into the Sweet 16 of NCAA four times and even hosted and won an NCAA Championship along the way.</p>\n<p>Talking about the essential creation of and dedication to the soccer program, Vom Steeg notes,</p>\n<p>“The big key for me has been the amount of work, the energy we’ve put in, the relationships we developed. The idea of starting over again has kept me from looking [at other options]. I’d rather keep enjoying what we’ve built here, and I still think there’s room for us to get better.”</p>\n<p>More specifically, this hard work has contributed to the establishment of Santa Barbara’s winning record over Cal Poly; one that, as of recently however, has begun to deteriorate.</p>\n<p>Now awaiting the 41st matchup, Vom Steeg hopes to break the sense of complacency that has overwhelmed the Gauchos’ gameplay in the past years. Upon the hiring of former US National coach Steve Sampson, Cal Poly has strategically and effectively dulled the matchups against their blue and gold rival. The result? Four straight draws at Harder Stadium since 2014, the latest two finalizing with scores of 0-0.</p>\n<p>To rationalize SLO’s gameplay, Vom Steeg points out, “When you get caught in a situation where maybe you’re not sure your talent matches up, you do things on the field to make it really hard to play.”</p>\n<p>He continues, “It’s up to us this year to, more than ever, try to figure out how we can make it into a more exciting soccer game than what it’s been.”</p>\n<p>Coach Tim Vom Steeg hopes to disrupt this pattern of stagnancy with a sweet victory over the Mustangs. After all, the win could be the 258th of his career, 24th against their program, and the key to unleashing the prideful insanity that the community has so eagerly awaited to display.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84555\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84555\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/","id":3664,"author":{"id":283,"name":"Annika Pearson"},"related":[3663,3662,3661],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Now, Carlton-Carew can add fashion designer and human rights advocate to her resume.</p>\n<p>The T-shirts were created by Carlton-Carew to promote the upcoming premiere of her documentary series, titled “America Show Me Your Hands,” which will be released on YouTube within the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a mini docuseries that will analyze certain social issues going on within America and what Americans think we should do to fix those issues that are occuring within our environment or our community,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just about holding each other accountable for our future.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the meaning behind the phrase “America Show Me Your Hands,” Carlton-Carew said she associated it with a mother catching her child sneaking a cookie from the cookie jar and asking them to show her their hands.</p>\n<p>“It’s more engaging that way, it’s in a loving way; I want people to be transparent with each other because I want people to have conversations [about social issues],” she said.</p>\n<p>The series will be comprised of short 15-minute films. It will spotlight relevant social and political issues circulating the country including sexism, racism, healthcare, affordable education and housing, among other topics.</p>\n<p>The first episode will address xenophobia, the dislike or fear of people from foreign countries, a topic that is one of personal interest to Carlton-Carew, whose parents are both from Sierra Leone, West Africa.</p>\n<p>A large portion of the episode will highlight the effects of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) on its recipients.</p>\n<p>“Temporary Protected Status allows certain people from certain countries to come to America if they’re seeking asylum, or their country experienced natural disasters or if it is unsafe for them to be there,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew, whose mother came to the United States under TPS in the 1990s as a result of the Sierra Leone Civil War, experienced firsthand the confusion that arises among the recipients when their status is terminated.</p>\n<p>Prior to President Trump’s administration, when a country that was originally granted TPS was deemed safe once again, the government would notify the recipients but then fail to enforce any action to send them back to their native country.</p>\n<p>They also would not provide them with the steps necessary to apply for citizenship in America, according to Carlton-Carew.</p>\n<p>Currently refugees from Haiti, El Salvador, Nepal and Honduras who have sought refuge in America to escape natural disasters and violence within their countries have been notified that they need to leave between 2019 and 2020 or face deportation, according to Carlton-Carew.</p>\n<p>Through “America Show Me Your Hands,” Carlton-Carew aims to promote transparency and accountability between Americans in regards to these intense topics.</p>\n<p>“I want empathy; I want people to be able to understand each other’s situations. The only reason why I am where I am today is because Americans in my community didn’t look at my mother and I as strangers … they embraced us as Americans should do and they made sure that we felt welcome,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>The first episode will consist primarily of Carlton-Carew’s own story in regards to xenophobia, along with news clippings and photos of children from Honduras and Nepal that she received from a photographer who traveled there.</p>\n<p>The following episode, tackling affordable housing, will feature testimonials from college students who recognize the issue in their society and have begun taking steps to effect change in their community.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew wanted to create the film series during her first year at UCSB. However, it was only recently that she decided on a specific format and film topics and began to act on her ideas.</p>\n<p>“I started getting more involved in politics, and given our political climate I thought this was the most appropriate time. I couldn’t sit on this idea any longer –– I had to pursue it,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>Her decision to become involved in A.S. was largely a result of her desire to see more film major representation within Senate.</p>\n<p>As first pro-tempore and off-campus senator, Carlton-Carew aspires to not only be a liaison between the student body and their senators but also to promote increased opportunities for student filmmakers.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew hopes to reach young adults with her T-shirts and documentaries in an effort to empower them.</p>\n<p>“I just want to empower young people to take charge of their future. By interviewing them, it puts them on a platform to engage with other people who might find [their stories] interesting.”</p>\n<p>As her following grows, Carlton-Carew, who designs the merchandise with her mom, aims to expand her products to include both hats and laptop stickers.</p>\n<p>“I want people to [see my shirt] and think about what it means,” Carlton-Carew said. “This is our future … America, show me your hands.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Zaveeni Khan-Marcus, who has been the director for the MultiCultural Center (MCC) since its founding, is the “heart and soul” of the center, according to Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life.</p>\n<p>Armistead works with the center in an administrative capacity and has known Khan-Marcus since they were both undergraduate students at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), when the center was first introduced.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of history with Zaveeni and I and with me watching the center grow,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>The MCC was a small room on the other side of campus when it was first founded in 1987 after students of color protested their lack of inclusion within the university. When the University Center expansion was commissioned in 1994, the organization’s current space by Ortega Dining Commons was created.</p>\n<p>Now the center holds a theater, a meeting room and lounge. While the MCC has suffered from limited funding, it has been able to maintain its 24-25 programs each quarter while also increasing the scale on which it operates.</p>\n<p>“Last quarter, we had Kimberle Crenshaw who gave a talk at Campbell Hall, and even though Campbell Hall holds only about 800 seats, we had 1,200 people who showed up for that event,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>She sees this as tangible proof there is demand, and an expectation, for the MCC to continue to host speakers or put on events that create a “platform for conversation about race, class, social justice [and] equality.”</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also works with faculty to create awareness on campus; some faculty members even offer extra credit to students who attend these events.</p>\n<p>The spaces within the MCC are also open to cultural organizations affiliated with the center, which often host meetings or events there.</p>\n<p>“We provide opportunities for UCSB students [to immerse themselves in] other cultural experiences. MCC is definitely the best place to provide such international and cultural communications,” said Takafumi Igarashi, director of social activities for the International Student Association.</p>\n<p>Beyond its existence as an event space, the MCC is focused on giving voice to students.</p>\n<p>“Throughout our 30-year existence currently, centralizing the students is one of the most important things we do,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>The MCC is led by a board of students, staff and faculty. Student representatives come from various cultural organizations that are affiliated with the center.</p>\n<p>“They come together and they have conversations, inform us about what their needs are, but also represent to the campus the needs of … the marginalized students,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>These students are able to have challenging conversations and come together to support each other and advance student activism during a difficult campus climate, according to Armistead.</p>\n<p>While the MCC is typically known as a home away from home for students of color, the center has also opened itself up to transgender students on campus with its Trans* Initiative.</p>\n<p>“In the last couple of years, transgender students have felt comfortable with this space … so that’s saying a lot – it’s a huge statement that they feel comfortable within the walls of this center,” said Khan-Marcus.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing resources and working with the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to make UCSB a more inclusive campus, the MCC hosts weekly meetings for “all trans folks and supportive allies,” according to its website.</p>\n<p>However, while the MCC is entering its 30th year of existence, this center is not the norm nationwide.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge statement, that UCSB has had a MultiCultural Center for 30 years. A lot of my colleagues from other campuses feel strongly that this MultiCultural Center is a very important, transformative space,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Other universities trying to follow in UCSB’s footsteps might face pushback from administration or minimal funding and staffing because multicultural centers are identity-based spaces, but Khan-Marcus advises them to continuously advocate for their students.</p>\n<p>“Social justice work is challenging, because it’s not easy work, but it’s absolutely needed at every campus. Even in this day and age, if you go and talk to some students of color, they will share with you that at times that they feel invisible at UCSB,” she said.</p>\n<p>For Lily Pham, Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) co-president, it is heartening to know that there’s someone out there who cares about centers like the MCC.</p>\n<p>“There’s some statistic that if you look it up, it’ll say we’re pretty up there in diversity. But that’s not always prevalent when you’re just walking around and seeing, at a face value, what the campus is,” Pham said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Sept. 20 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The groups exchanged greetings and hopeful sentiments.</p>\n<p>“They said ‘Thank you.’ Just ‘Thank you’ that we remember them, that we gave them time … that we came,” Rodríguez said.“We said to them, you know, ‘Have faith that there is someone here that thinks about you everyday, if nothing else, that you’re not disappeared.’”</p>\n<p>Un Llanto Colectivo is the first major action that Las Maestras Center has organized since its opening in March of this year. The faculty currently consists of Rodríguez, a lecturer on campus, and Cherrie Moraga, a professor in the English Department at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The group, which stems from the English Department at UCSB, aims to educate students and preserve the thought, traditions and culture of indigenous communities, according to its website.</p>\n<p>“Indigenous thought has been fragmented, punctured, disengaged, decontextualized, made into these little kind of exotic things. [Las] Maestras center wanted to bring [indigenous thought] back into focus,” Rodríguez said.</p>\n<p>With initial funding they received from UCSB, Rodríguez hopes to continue to expand Las Maestras through developing programs, hiring interns and developing a voice on campus. In the six months since opening, Las Maestras has already begun to connect with other groups seeking collaborations.</p>\n<p>Rodríguez stresses the importance of individuals to stay active in their communities and pay attention to the social and political issues happening around them.</p>\n<p>“Unless you stop injustice, it will continue to roll and eventually you’re gonna feel it,” Rodríguez said. “We have to keep vigilant and keep active. I think that’s an important piece of it, you know, because it’s not over.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Sept. 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

the way that students are supported and included contributes to their academic and professional success.</p>\n<p>The Nexus interviewed several directors of Student Affairs departments and found that the university’s main success comes from bolstering the student body; from the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) to Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.), the university’s programs help foster a healthy environment.</p>\n<p>However, problems also stem from rising enrollment rates, which have left university resource programs struggling to provide for a student body that increases by several hundred students each year.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jones, director of EOP, said the needs of students will always exceed the department’s abilities to meet those needs, which consistently leaves departments in a game of catch-up.</p>\n<p>“Student Affairs … [has] for decades struggled to keep up with the resources needed to provide for the services the students have either needed, or quite frankly demanded,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Even when departments can predict an influx of students, it is still difficult to prepare for the one-on-one services they might require, said Gary White, director of the Disabled Students Program (DSP).</p>\n<p>“I think we’re [servicing] about maybe six percent of our student population and we know the national average is almost 11, 10.9 percent,” White said.</p>\n<p>“We know that they’re coming … and we want to have the resources, the firepower, the systems in place so that we can handle when that onslaught comes.</p>\n<p>One of the DSP’s most common services is providing alternate testing locations for students during their midterms and finals, which can be difficult given the disproportionate amount of classrooms and labs on campus compared to the number of students, according to White.</p>\n<p>“It’s just one of those things where we don’t have time to gripe about ‘oh, this is a roadblock,’ it’s just like ‘alright, we gotta make it a speed bump’ and still keep going forward,” White said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is legally mandated to ensure that all students have equal access to educational opportunities on campus, so any failure of the DSP to do so would leave the university open to lawsuits.</p>\n<p>As the campus continues to grow, several Student Affairs departments cite concerns about being able to service their students.</p>\n<p>For instance, C.A.R.E. – an unusual department at UCSB, as most college campuses don’t dedicate entire offices to student advocacy – Director Brianna Conway said her staffers still find it difficult to always have someone available for a student because of how many students they serve.</p>\n<p>Jones also noted a similar problem with the EOP office.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to have to be more mindful of managing time and resources to be as efficient as possible while not losing out on quality or our ability to be able to connect individually with students,” he said.</p>\n<p>These problems are the result of minimal funding, a key problem within the University of California system.</p>\n<p>“Funding is always an issue,” White said. “We’re getting as much as we can.”</p>\n<p>White does his best to “keep folks abreast of the numbers” and continually updates the vice chancellor’s office as enrollment in DSP increases throughout the school year.</p>\n<p>Despite these difficulties, White believes DSP offers students who wouldn’t traditionally attend university the opportunity to succeed.</p>\n<p>“We know that if someone is qualified to come, there needs to be space for them to be here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Several departments in the division of Student Affairs highlight the importance of providing students with a sense of belonging, which in turn can help students succeed academically.</p>\n<p>“Research shows that a student is more academically successful and happier when they feel like they belong in a place,” said Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of Student Life.</p>\n<p>Armistead overlooks the cluster of Student Affairs departments that revolve around student life, particularly the Office of Student Life (OSL). OSL focuses on fraternity and sorority life, registered organizations and leadership development.</p>\n<p>While Armistead feels the OSL has strengthened its relationship with fraternities and sororities in recent years, she now wants to turn attention to registered organizations on campus.</p>\n<p>With the recent hire of campus organizations coordinator Justin Littleton, a recent UCSB graduate and former OSL intern, Armistead hopes to see memberships in registered organizations grow with the dedicated attention Littleton will be providing.</p>\n<p>Armistead also prides herself on the “one-stop shop” aspect of the OSL.</p>\n<p>“People come to us for so many different things and what we try never to do is ‘Oh we don’t do that here.’ We try to at least connect students to where they need to be. We’ll pick up the phone, or we’ll even Google it for them so they don’t have to leave feeling like ‘Well now what do I do?’ ” she said.</p>\n<p>As head of C.A.R.E., Conway also sees the same duty as an essential part of her job.</p>\n<p>“I always like to think of it as we’re like a hub of the wheel, so the student doesn’t have to navigate all of these [campus entities] by themselves,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway and her staff work as direct service providers for students, staff and faculty who are dealing with sexual assault, domestic violence or stalking.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E.’s main office is located in the Women’s Center in the Student Resource Building (SRB); however, the office established a second location in Isla Vista two years ago in order to make itself more accessible to all students.</p>\n<p>“Not everyone wants to walk into the women’s center –– what about our male survivors? Or LGBTQ students that … come here for other spaces or events … to come and receive services might not feel as comfortable,” she said.</p>\n<p>Conway also notes the lack of graduate students who approach the C.A.R.E. office for assistance.</p>\n<p>“I think sometimes grad students don’t feel like there’s a place for them, or that the services aren’t for them or aren’t tailored for them,” she said.</p>\n<p>The C.A.R.E. office has grown since Conway first started in 2013, from three full-time staff members and one part-time staff member to an office of eight full-time staff members and several interns.</p>\n<p>The inclusion of student interns on staff has helped to bring student insight to the office, Conway said.</p>\n<p>The EOP office also relies on a similar peer-to-peer model in developing a sense of belonging for its students, who are primarily, but not exclusively, first-generation students and come from low socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“EOP’s mission and history is our ability over the many years to be able to have both a collective and an individual connection to students, and that’s certainly made a difference in my undergraduate career and as a professional staff person. Sometimes for a student at a particular point in life, that [connection] makes all the difference,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>While most students develop that sense of belonging through campus organizations, Associated Students (A.S.) President Brooke Kopel wants to help students who aren’t involved in organizations feel at home on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our student government, our administrators, our faculty need to be the ones who are making sure students, regardless of whatever they’re involved in, feel welcomed on campus, feel like they can get help when they need it,” she said.</p>\n<p>Kopel says that although there is always room for improvement, the university “has the best intentions in mind for its students, even when it falls short at times.”</p>\n<p>She believes what makes UCSB great is the pressure from students on the university over the years to make it more inclusive and supportive of its population.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons why … the EOP exists is because students in the mid-60s were demanding that there be some sort of place or home for students who have otherwise been denied access historically to public higher education at colleges and universities,” Jones added.</p>\n<p>Jones cites <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/one-year-later-el-centro-reopens-its-doors/\">El Centro</a> in particular as a pivotal space for Chicanx students, faculty and community members who find value and comfort in their shared history.</p>\n<p>“These spaces have provided a home away from home for first-generation college students whose parents may not necessarily have been able to prepare them for what it’s like to go into a college environment,” he said.</p>\n<p>As UCSB continues to support its students academically, Jones hopes the university also sees the value of the holistic support Student Affairs provides in its “direct and immediate” impact on students.</p>\n<p>“The need is there, so I think the challenge is how best we can [support our students] with the resources we have, with the needs that are always gonna exceed the resources.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Sept. 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

I was unhappy, and I didn’t have a place to call home on campus or in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>It’s funny how things change.</p>\n<p>I’ve been struck with flashbacks to specific moments at UCSB — like when my roommate, Raechel, and I ran around the lagoon for the first time freshman year, or when I canoed down the Colorado River with the Adventure Programs, or even when I walked through I.V. on one particular Saturday morning, soaking in the pure, hungover magic of it all.</p>\n<p>Over the years, these are the moments that have made me love UCSB, but I can’t tell you enough how much stepping into the <em>Nexus</em> office for the first time changed my life.</p>\n<p>It’s a dark, cold office with too much stale coffee but the perfect amount of old newspapers and dusty books. The people are warm and intelligent, without fail, every passing year and with each new class.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> also does this thing that I love: It preserves memories and moments with every photo, every article and every Thursday print issue. And I hope the <em>Nexus</em> continues to be an emblem for our community, long after I’m gone and I am only left with the memories.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> and the people I have met during my time on staff have shaped the person I am today, but the <em>Nexus</em> continues to grow itself. I encourage you to be patient as Nexites learn more about themselves and the kind of journalists they want to be.</p>\n<p>I know we don’t always get it right. We won’t always get it right. It is our job as storytellers to listen to our community and fellow students to ensure that the history we’re preserving is accurate, its people accountable for their actions.</p>\n<p>Jorge Mercado, the next editor in chief, is kind and capable, and will slip a sports reference into most any conversation, if given the opportunity. I hope you pop into his office to chat — his door is always open.</p>\n<p>Goodbyes are strange, but reporting on our community for the <em>Nexus</em> has assured me that I can always reflect on our shared moments documented in archives and stamped onto history. Maybe it’s not even goodbye, after all, its merely the passing of one era and on to the next.</p>\n<p>Thank you to every interviewee, to the dear <em>Nexus</em>, to my best friends and #roommate4life. And to you, UCSB, thanks for making me want to stick around.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/","id":3656,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3655,3654,3653],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter From the Editor: Merk’s Paradise","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2018-06-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/34509119_1828549473869117_1321158792385134592_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/34509119_1828549473869117_1321158792385134592_n.jpg?resize=960%2C640&ssl=1","description":"New Editor-in-Chief Jorge Mercado introduces himself and examines the past three years in college, and the nexus, that has led him to this point.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hello everybody!

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let’s start with the hard stuff. What does this mean for you the student? I am the first EIC in a long time that has come from the sports section. Because of that, I want to bring more variety to this paper and have a lot more feature-style content across all sections to help all of you students feel more connected to this paper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we do a good job of being the voice for students, but I know we can do even better. Each and every one of you on campus has a story, so come to share it with us. Every single voice at UCSB is vital to that change, and, as editor in chief, it is my top priority to incorporate your voices into our journalism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also hope to expand our outreach and find new and creative ways to reach out to students, whether that be through podcasts or another medium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, however, I want our reporting to stay as great as it has been. We are a newspaper and we are journalists and it is our job to bring you the truth. In a time where “fake news” is as prevalent as hopefully, it will ever be, we want to be a trusted outlet that you can rely on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That doesn’t mean we are perfect. We will make mistakes. We will publish things that not everyone will agree with. This is what comes with being in this business. But know that every single thing we do, we do it because we believe it is the right thing to do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, really quickly, I’d love to take the time by saying how much I love The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining this college newspaper has easily been the best decision of my life. I can honestly say that after three years of college, I would not be who I am right now had I not joined the paper — and most would say I am a pretty pleasant person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For as long as I can remember, sports was always at the forefront of my mind. I loved to play. But after not being blessed with tremendous stature, my hopes of ever playing football at a D-I level were never going to happen, so I decided to write about sports instead!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, only I would have been dumb enough to pick a school that doesn’t have a football team, considering it is my favorite sport, but I think everything worked out all right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better than that though are the people. Everyone I have ever met here has been so kind and wonderful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a better part of two years, I worked with Sean White, as we were both sports editors, and it was the best experience of my life. Usually working with people sucks — we all hate group projects — but working with Sean was incredibly easy. We knew our goal was to grow the section and I think we did that. I wish him the best as he prepares to graduate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as important are the three ladies that came before me in this position, Megan Mineiro, Supriya Yelimeli and Maura Fox. I have nothing but respect and admiration for these women listed. If you want to meet kind, hardworking, talented people, then they are perfect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three did tremendous things as EIC, not just making sure this place stayed afloat but rather shifting their attention to making this paper the best it can be. I would love to tell you more about each one of them because they are so special, but I only have so much space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is because of them that I am confident in stepping into this role. Three years ago all I wanted to do was write about sports — I never even thought about running for EIC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as I kept growing up, kept learning from these ladies, in particular, I realized my heart was not just in sports, it was in this paper as a whole.

Vistan about the tradition at Woodstock’s, which opened its I.V. location in 1982.</p>\n<p>The patrons shout, groan and embrace each other as question after question leaves them with tip-of-the-tongue quandaries — the classic “I was just reading about this last week!” frustration. Students cram into booths, often planting themselves on empty pizza boxes atop beer kegs to have a place to sit and participate.</p>\n<p>Shift manager Robbie King does nothing to quell the carnivalesque display. Instead, he walks among the flurry, announcing questions, collecting response sheets and withstanding drunk hecklers. He has no time for disgruntled trivia-goers; there are questions to ask and hearts to crush.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83495\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83495\" data-attachment-id=\"83495\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/1-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"1 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83495 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83495\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tuesday night marked Robbie King’s first whole year of running Woodstock’s Trivia Night. <em>Angie Banks/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>He will, however, accept the occasional hug, especially when a team cracks one of his tougher quizzes.</p>\n<p>“I feel like people really respond when you’re just out there,” King said a few hours before Tuesday night’s festivities. “If you’re going for it, especially in I.V., people aren’t going to judge you for being confident and out there on the microphone.”</p>\n<p>“As long as you don’t write all awful questions,” he added, “[they] love it a ton.”</p>\n<p>King has worked nearly five years at Woodstock’s, putting in time at both the UC Santa Barbara Arbor and I.V. locations. He graduated from UCSB last year with a degree in history.</p>\n<p>At his Tuesday showing, which marked a year since he took over as the Trivia Night host, it was clear King’s evenhandedness has earned him respect — and even admiration.</p>\n<p>One team name on Tuesday was, “Robbie is a Tender Lover.” Another dubbed itself, “Leave Robbie Alone!”</p>\n<p>“People won’t believe that I’ll actually say that over the microphone,” King laughed.</p>\n<p>Unlike I.V.’s other evening draws, like the discounted premium beer at Woodstock’s Wednesday pint nights, Trivia Night gives Isla Vistans something to do. There are endless pitchers of beer sold during the event, but the evening’s lure isn’t rooted in drinking alcohol for its own sake.</p>\n<p>There’s also no politeness among strangers here; adjacent booths become fast enemies and tables break into conspiratorial huddles.</p>\n<p>“It’s a part of I.V. culture that isn’t just drinking,” King said. “Sure, there’s plenty of drinking, but it’s all about interactions people are having. It’s competition — friendly, most of the time. I really love doing it because I have a good energy about it and people come in here with a good energy about it.”</p>\n<p>Themed events generate the biggest crowds. One night saw all of the questions styled around the television series “The Office.” So many showed up that some groups scurried onto the floor while participants leaned in over the patio rail. Another five-week derby went, decade by decade, from the 1960s through the 2000s. I.V. packed the house, even during UCSB’s Dead Week.</p>\n<p>But the bare-bones, general-knowledge questions are the real challenge, especially when King reaches for topics just out of the average attendee’s grasp.</p>\n<p>One of his favorite questions from the event’s history? “What do you call a female sheep?’” he said. The subject seems banal, but the answer would elude many: an “ewe.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of people thought they should know that but didn’t, so I got like several, ‘This question sucks,’ ‘Fuck this question,’ ‘I can’t believe you asked this,’” King recalled. “I didn’t realize the ewes generate so much controversy.”</p>\n<p>King deep-dives into Wikipedia each week to come up with a balanced spread of head-scratchers. What drew him toward the event as a freshman, he said, was the element of “mental prowess.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a funny sort of knowledge, really,” he said. “I get like a lot of little tiny details about things.”</p>\n<p>In a year of running the show, King has absorbed his fair share of trivia. In fact, he can now tell you which team appeared in the most Super Bowls during the 1990s.</p>\n<p>“How useful is that? I don’t know, but now I have that filed away.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.6 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/warm-wild-nights-at-woodstocks-weekly-trivia/","id":3648,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[3647,3646,3645],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bong, Bong, Bong: The Hands Behind the Carillon Bells","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2018-06-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3472.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3472.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As a member of Adjunct Professor Margo Halsted’s carillon bells class, Sophia Tao has spent the last two years making the trek up the tower at least once a week to play the bells.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Drunken bets, gate-hopping and Google searches for “how to hotwire the elevator”: UC Santa Barbara students spend their college careers plotting different ways to get to the top of Storke Tower before they graduate.</p>\n<p>Sophia Tao, a fourth-year pharmacology major, is one of the lucky few who has been to the top.

It is typical for students to already be proficient piano players when they enter the course.</p>\n<p>Halsted has been working with Tao and two other students, Iris Xie, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, and David Hwang, a material sciences graduate student, since 2016.</p>\n<p>All three students will be graduating this spring.</p>\n<p>Tao and Xie will have the opportunity to play the carillon for approximately ten minutes each before joining their fellow graduates at their respective ceremonies, while Halsted is slated to play during the remaining thirty minutes.</p>\n<p>“[I’m] kinda nervous because there’s actually gonna be a ton of people listening. During the weekend, it’s pretty empty, so it’s less nerve-wracking, I guess,” Tao said. “I definitely have to practice.”</p>\n<p>Currently, the three students trade off playing the bells on weekend mornings from 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. During the weekdays, there isn’t a suitable “window of time” where they can practice since classes run from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., Tao said.</p>\n<p>While most traditional carillon songs are “not really recognizable,” Tao still enjoys playing ones that are more up-tempo because the bells ring more distinctly.</p>\n<p>“[Students] play music written for carillon… arrangements of music for other instruments, their own compositions and arrangements and popular songs that UCSB students like to hear,” Halsted said in an email. “Everyone loves to hear music they already know.”</p>\n<p>“I know someone played the Harry Potter theme, some people played the Pokémon theme song. We, once, last year I think, played the Rick Roll song during April Fools,” Tao said.</p>\n<p>Tao said she decided to audition for Halsted’s class her freshman year after a friend recommended it to her.</p>\n<p>“I thought it would be really cool to be a part of this huge landmark of our school,” Tao said. Before playing the carillon for the first time, Halsted’s students start off on a piano and then transition to a practice keyboard that is similar in structure to the carillon.</p>\n<p>Tao’s 15 years of piano playing translated smoothly to playing the carillon, despite the added component of playing with one’s feet in addition to their hands.

Over the course of a year, the students worked on submitting both video and audio recordings of their playing, receiving feedback from the judges and using that feedback to improve and resubmit their applications.</p>\n<p>While the students had the ease of working at their own pace throughout this process, Tao recalled how long it took and how eager she was to be certified. She began preparing for the certification during the Winter Quarter of her junior year and was recently certified at the beginning of Winter Quarter this year.</p>\n<p>Halsted’s students were able to travel to UC Berkeley and UC Riverside to play their carillons as well as host UC Berkeley’s Guild for a recital on campus, Tao said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really cool to see them talk about all this… like the history, the people who’ve played it, the music,” Tao said. “There’s actually so much [history] behind it and even so much history behind the people who make the bells.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83467\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83467\" data-attachment-id=\"83467\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/bong-bong-bong-the-hands-behind-the-carillon-bells/img_3461/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3461\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83467 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83467\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The three students alternate playing the bells on weekend mornings from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. <em>Sanya Kamidi/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Tao reached out to a former carillon student of Halsted’s who now plays at Trinity Cathedral in San Jose, California, Tao’s hometown, and hopes to be able to continue to play the instrument there.</p>\n<p>“I’m just really happy that I had this experience, and it’s something that I’ve done a really long time,” Tao said. “It’s one of the defining activities and memories I have of UCSB.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.6 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

recital and art exhibition on Thursday. <em>Courtesy of Osiris Gómez </em></p></div>\n<p>For the first time at UC Santa Barbara, indigenous writers, poets and scholars gathered for “A Verbal Kaleidoscope,” a conference aiming to challenge how indigenous literature and practices are studied in Western academia by presenting modern-day indigenous literary movements.</p>\n<p>Throughout eight sessions across two days, the Spanish and Portuguese department brought together Juan Gregorio Regino, director of Mexico’s National Institute of Indigenous Languages, native Zapotec and Mazatec writers and local community members to discuss contemporary and ancestral indigenous peoples’ literary perspectives.</p>\n<p>The conference, which ran through April 4 and 5, started with a singing ceremony by local Chumash tribal members acknowledging and respecting the tribe’s history and life in their land in the nearby area.</p>\n<p>A majority of the discussions were held in Spanish and the poetry recital held at the Art, Design and Architecture Museum was translated from the native languages such as Irma Pineda Santiago’s poems in Zapotec.</p>\n<p>“We were very surprised by the caliber of the presentations,” Osiris Gómez, Ph.D. candidate in Hispanic Literature and conference organizer said.</p>\n<p>Gómez previously said organizers wanted to break traditional conference dynamics by creating a more fluid conversation and feels they were able to accomplish that goal, but believes there is still room to grow when exploring indigenous literature in academia.</p>\n<p>“It was an amazing experience to be able to bring together writers and scholars in this level, especially people from all over the country and abroad,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>Gómez was impressed with the speakers’ keynote presentations and said they opened up the conversation for other speakers to participate and break out of the one-way conversation that presentations often create.</p>\n<p>He appreciated the speakers’ creativity in using their own literary work for their responses, such as when Juan Gregorio Regino started reading from his poetry to answer the questions from the moderator.</p>\n<p>“That’s when we really went into the poetic act to explore [the conversation],” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>At a later panel during the conference, Regino spoke about “revolutionizing modern literature,” claiming that what indigenous scholars are doing with their work is of the most contemporary literature in the world today.</p>\n<p>“La poesía lingüísticamente es una reconstrucción de la propia lengua,” Regino said, meaning “poetry linguistically reconstructs language.”</p>\n<p>He continued by saying that creating poetry with native languages indigenous people can get them involved in the world of creating literature.</p>\n<p>Another element of poetry that Regino finds useful for indigenous people is “la afirmación de decir ‘aquí estamos, aqui esta nuestras lenguas, aquí están nuestras escrituras y estamos vivos,’” Regino said, meaning “the affirmation in saying ‘we are here, here are our tongues, here is our literature and we are alive.”</p>\n<p>Regino said the indigenous literary movement is in a transition and that the conference itself has explored ways to see from the outside how the movement is progressing.</p>\n<p>The movement “tiene que transcender el mundo indígena, y solamente así es como cambiamos y vamos a sentir entendidos. Solamente así este movimiento va tener presencia y fuerza,” Regino said, meaning “[the movement] has to transcend outside of the indigenous world and only then will we feel understood and have presence and strength.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82342\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82342\" data-attachment-id=\"82342\"

giving the language a linguistically poetic aspect. <em>Lianna Nakashima/Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p>Cherrie Moraga, award-winning author for This Bridge Called My Back and newly-hired English professor, spoke during the first session titled “Beyond Aztlan: New Nahua Perspectives.” Her talk, “Throwing Shade to the West,” presented a Xicana indigena point of view within literature and academia.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Moraga pointed out the long history of colonization of indigenous people and how traditional language departments were “generated from a very eurocentric perspective.”</p>\n<p>Moraga applauded the Spanish department for hosting a conference on subjects typically only covered in the field of anthropology.</p>\n<p>“To think that a Spanish department was actually hosting a conference on indigenous languages is an incredible breakthrough,” Moraga said.</p>\n<p>“[The conference] speaks to this evolution of consciousness beginning to happen even among sites that traditionally held indigenous thinking and people in disregard,” Moraga said.</p>\n<p>Moraga was particularly impressed with the Chumash women who spoke about recovering their own languages through working with non-indigenous anthropologists who have done research and have access to the languages.</p>\n<p>She said she admired them because “having to learn it through them, but then having to make it their own again,” is a challenge.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82341\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img

Cabranes-Grant, chair of the Spanish and Portuguese department, asked “Qué tipo de conocimiento nos ofrece la poesía y qué instrumento epistemológico es la poesía?” meaning “What knowledge does poetry offer us and what epistemological instruments does it have?”</p>\n<p>Zapotec poet Irma Pineda Santiago responded by saying that poetry has a broad social function beyond communication and the various genres of the ancestral Zapotec language can particularly allow poetry to go beyond its traditional elements.</p>\n<p>“People were speaking from their creative process and to me, that was amazing, you can only get that type of conversation when you interview an author,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>In the future, Gómez said, if a second version of the conference is possible, they will grow from this one and come up with new conference dynamics. “I think this conference was a great step in bringing a different type of conversation,” he said.</p>\n<p>Gómez noted that in bringing these poets to the conference, one can assume that they are representatives and can speak for their whole community or nation, but Gómez said they were very humble when presenting themselves.</p>\n<p>“They told us ‘this is what I do and this is how I represent my community,’ It was far more nourishing than just having a set of questions and their keynote address,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>“The intent of this conference is to create consciousness and not just about the political aspects of the literature, but I want it to become an invitation for people to actually become acquainted and curious,” Gómez said.</p><div

university’s Slavic studies, geology and military science librarian. In addition to her duties as a librarian, she studies vexillology, the study of flags and their historical and symbolic significance.</p>\n<p>Platoff’s interest in flags began as a childhood obsession. As a young girl, she recalled collecting flag patches and recruiting friends and family to help her gather them.</p>\n<p>Today, she has a collection of over 3,000 flags and is the leading North American expert on National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) flags and regional flags of Russia and the former Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>Platoff says flags are very symbolic and emotion-filled objects that can represent different ideals for different groups. She said an understanding of the connection between emotions and politics could help people understand the take-a-knee movement.</p>\n<p>“To some people, the take-a-knee movement is about the flag,” she said. “There is so much emotion tied up in them that people read them different ways depending on their personal background and history.”</p>\n<p>The take-a-knee movement began when 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick remained sitting during the National Anthem at a football game in August 2016, which since then sparked different football players to kneel during the anthem.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t understand the perspective of African Americans … or perhaps other groups that do not enjoy equal treatment under the law, you would see it as an affront to the flag,” Platoff said. “But if you look from their perspective, you can understand why the take-a-knee movement has taken off.”</p>\n<p>Platoff believes she has the best flag collection in North American relating to NASA, as well as flags made in Russia or the Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>Through her vexillology research, Platoff has found connections between the United States and Russia through both countries’ experiences with nationalist groups. She says flags are oftentimes controversial symbols because they can be interpreted differently depending on an individual’s personal history.</p>\n<p>Platoff said a new nationalist group in Ukraine uses the flag of the old Ukrainian Insurgent Army, a former nationalist group from World War II which fought both with and against the Nazis, as the symbolic representation of their group. Ukraine has a mix of Ukrainian and Russian culture.</p>\n<p>“When a Ukrainian sees this flag, they see it as a Ukrainian national symbol,” she said. “But when a Russian sees that flag, they think it’s a fascist symbol.”</p>\n<p>She compares this situation with the United States’ struggle surrounding the Confederate flag in the United States.</p>\n<p>“When you see the Confederate flag you may think it’s a racist symbol, but someone from the South will see it as a symbol of their Southern heritage,” Platoff said.</p>\n<p>Platoff developed her flag expertise when she worked as a librarian at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where she became interested in different NASA flags. Within her current collection, Platoff has flags that have flown on Gemini and Apollo space missions.</p>\n<p>Platoff’s work with NASA’s flags also extends past her collection, as she wrote the official NASA history of the flag used in the Apollo XI mission, as well as a paper for the University of California negating moon landing conspiracies.</p>\n<p>She explained that conspiracy theorists were examining the wrinkles of a flag on the moon, which appeared to be blowing in the wind — impossible in a place with zero gravity. She refuted their claims by noting that the flag was created with two rods running perpendicular to the vertical pole, allowing for the illusion of movement.</p>\n<p>Platoff has also held many positions within North American Vexillological Association (NAVA), serving as the first and second vice president, and is now the director of NAVA’s digital library.</p>\n<p>Platoff says she is most proud of the publication of her first published work on flags in NASA, “Where No Flag Has Gone Before: Political and Technical Aspects of Placing a Flag on the Moon.” The paper won the prestigious Captain William Driver Award, which is presented at NAVA’s annual conference.</p>\n<p>“No one had really written anything about the political aspects in deciding to put a flag on the moon and the technical engineering problems associated with it,” she said. “This was the first work to sort of look at those together.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Platoff believes she has the best NASA, Russian and Soviet Union flag collection in North America, not the best North American flag collection.  </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 26, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

to families and children<strong>,</strong> the Isla Vista Youth Projects executive director will be retiring on Jan. 31, 2018. She will be leaving behind a legacy of improving the low-cost childcare services available to families in I.V.</p>\n<p>IVYP is a nonprofit organization that offers childcare and family education services in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am fortunate in that my job is the perfect intersection of my passion, skillsets, faith, and calling,” Miller said. “I recognize how rare it is that I get up every day and love to go to work.”</p>\n<p>Miller has worked at the organization for so long because she believes every child should have the opportunity to access schooling regardless of socioeconomic status, residence or skin color.</p>\n<p>“I am lucky enough to work with the cutest kids in the world in such a supportive community,” she said.</p>\n<p>Originally hired as the I.V. preschool principal, Miller was promoted to executive director after one year and has held the position since 1986. She said she was originally terrified to accept the position.</p>\n<p>Over the course of her career, Miller has seen IVYP expand from a single classroom to a multi-site, multi-program agency throughout the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>Miller’s proudest accomplishment is the national accreditation of the Children’s Center. The accreditation is particularly meaningful to her because the standards for approval are very high.</p>\n<p>Through her work with IVYP, Miller has seen many generations of families pass through the Children’s Center. Individuals that participated in the program as children have grown and returned to volunteer as adults and eventually enroll their own children, she says.</p>\n<p>She has many success stories with the children she works with, recalling that a young woman who enrolled in IVYP as a child graduated from UC Berkeley this past June. This, she says, is her favorite story because she is able to see the participants develop from infancy to college graduates.</p>\n<p>“This place gives our community the opportunity to know that a first-generation student going to college is very possible,” she said proudly.</p>\n<p>The facility on Phelps Road is equipped to serve children from the age of two to three months to preschool students. With 35 staff members and seven different classrooms, Miller has been instrumental in upgrading the facility during her time as director.</p>\n<p>The organization now has four facilities, including the Children’s Center on Phelps Road where many volunteers from UC Santa Barbara can gain teaching and childcare experience.</p>\n<p>“From holding babies, to one-on-one lessons with elementary-age children, IVYP had over 300 UCSB student volunteers this past school year for a total of over 600 volunteer hours,” Miller explained.</p>\n<p>As Miller’s time at IVYP comes to a close, she says her last project will be the creation of additional space for nine infants at the Children’s Center on UCSB’s West Campus.</p>\n<p>The project will cost approximately $20,000, and Miller said she hopes the community can collectively raise the funds. The Santa Barbara Foundation, a local philanthropic organization, has awarded IVYP $10,000 for the project.</p>\n<p>Miller said she is now eager to transition to a new period in her life. Though she will continue to do some consulting work for IVYP, she is looking forward to having more free time to spend with her family.</p>\n<p>“Life is precious, and I am now ready to relax after a great, long career,” she said.</p>\n<p>Miller will miss seeing the children each day but said she has faith in IVYP and believes it is organized by a “perfect group.”</p>\n<p>“It has always stayed true to its mission to serve I.V. and to stay in tune with what I.V. needs,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79093\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79093\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/","id":3644,"author":{"id":245,"name":"Miranda O'Brien"},"related":[3643,3642,3641],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tattoo Parlor’s Precious Dogs Leave Their Prints on Isla Vista Community","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2017-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Puppers-by-Anthony-Lai-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Puppers-by-Anthony-Lai-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Precious Slut Tattoo, a local piercing and tattoo parlor, has long grabbed the community’s attention with its risqué name.

Anthony<em> Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Precious Slut Tattoo, a local piercing and tattoo parlor, has long grabbed the community’s attention with its risqué name. Now, students have five more reasons to flock to the shop.</p>\n<p>Stormy, Jacob, Tucker, Buster Brown and Maisy have become an integral part of the Isla Vista community through their eagerness and friendly nature.</p>\n<p>Tracy Holt, who opened Precious Slut Tattoo 12 years ago, said his dogs are a form of support for Isla Vistans and visitors on both good and bad days.</p>\n<p>“Whether it’s finals, boyfriends, girlfriends just broke up with you, parents kicking them out of school, wrecked the car, DUI,” Holt said. “Everyone in Isla Vista seems to know those dogs; a lot of people know them by name.”</p>\n<p>Holt said he has owned dogs for his whole life and once owned 11 dogs at the same time. He said the “unmeasured” companionship is unlike any other.</p>\n<p>“There’s just no greater form of friendship,” Holt said. “It’s unsolicited.”</p>\n<p>While all of the dogs have been raised under the same roof, they’ve each developed distinct personalities.</p>\n<p>Stormy, one of the American Pit Bull Terriers, is seven years old and has established herself as the alpha dog of the pack. She is strong and protective but loving, and she insists on sitting at the kitchen table for dinner each night.</p>\n<p>Jacob, the six-year-old “chicken” and second pit bull, gets creative when it comes to stealing more time with Holt.</p>\n<p>“Jake sits on my shoes in the morning ’cause he knows I need them to leave,” Holt laughed.</p>\n<p>Holt said he is not supposed to have a favorite, but has a special attachment to Tucker, a two-year-old French Bulldog. The codependent Tucker follows Holt around everywhere he goes.</p>\n<p>Maisy is a one-and-a-half-year-old French Bulldog who enjoys fighting sprinklers in her free time.</p>\n<p>Buster Brown, the 10-month-old French Bulldog and baby of the group, is always ready for a chase, even if it means running into the street during a <em>Nexus</em> interview.</p>\n<p>Despite their varying ages and unique traits, Holt said all the dogs are protective and ready to defend anyone in need, even against Holt himself.</p>\n<p>“I’ve raised those dogs to protect anyone,” Holt said proudly, comparing it to raising children.</p>\n<p>“If you raise that animal to be shitty to other people … then I don’t feel that that dog is going to defend you,” he said. “You’ve allowed that to happen.”</p>\n<p>Owners should be especially mindful in raising muscular dogs like pit bulls because they have a greater potential for defense than smaller dogs, Holt said.</p>\n<p>“The only problem with the scenario of a pit bull is he’s genetically built and designed to be that star kind of athlete,” he said. “He just … is more capable of defending.”</p>\n<p>Several years ago, Holt’s dog of 14 years died. He didn’t know if he would get another.</p>\n<p>“There was such a vacancy in my life, a lack of protection, a lack of ability to hear what was going on outside my house,” he said. “I never noticed that void in my whole life … and then I just realized how vulnerable I felt without it.”</p>\n<p>Holt had trouble putting into words the positive impact that his pups have had on his life.</p>\n<p>“The thing that I feel like so many people are looking for in the world and don’t know where to find it … I feel like I’ve done all of that in this little mini group of mine,” he said.</p>\n<p>Holt owns two other Precious Slut Tattoo shops in Nevada in addition to the Isla Vista location.</p>\n<p>One of the shops is located in Las Vegas, where 58 people died in a mass shooting on Oct. 1, 2017.</p>\n<p>Holt, recalling the devastation in Isla Vista after the events of May 23, 2014, said the dogs have acted as a source of comfort for both communities in mourning.</p>\n<p>“If I could only say anything, it’s how at the end of the day no matter how shitty life is, no matter how bad this big mass shooting thing in Vegas… People come here and they pet these dogs, and you see it make a difference in people’s lives,” Holt said.</p>\n<p>Stormy, Jacob, Tucker,  Buster Brown and Maisy have been around to see several UCSB graduating classes come and go, and alumni remember them when they come back to visit.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<h2>Once living out of his car and contemplating suicide, international student Alagie Jammeh now has a bright future in the U.S.</h2>\n<p>There was a knock on the window.</p>\n<p>“Hey, what are you doing here? Are you sleeping in your car?” a policeman asked Alagie Jammeh, an international student from Gambia studying at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Jammeh was in fact living out of his vehicle and struggling to feed himself, sometimes going days without food. The officer warned Jammeh he would be ticketed if he continued sleeping in his car on campus.</p>\n<p>In September 2014, Jammeh posted on Facebook that “No one should be denied their basic fundamental human rights because of their sexuality.” Though he took the post down two days later after receiving calls from relatives back home warning him of the government’s reaction to his statement, it was too late. By November, his presidential scholarship from the Gambian government was cut off.</p>\n<p>Jammeh said he desired to be part of a community that embraces all people, irrespective of their gender identity. As a result of his newfound convictions, Jammeh found himself ostracized from his homeland and fearing for his life.</p>\n<p>“I was scared the Gambian government is going to send someone in America to kill me,” Jammeh said. “I was terrified that some people who disagreed with what I said on Facebook would eventually hunt me down.”</p>\n<p>Located on the west coast of Africa with a population of approximately 1.9 million, Gambia is one of 70 countries in the world that can imprison citizens for their sexual orientation. President of Gambia, Yahya Jammeh — a distant uncle of Alagie — stated during his address to the United Nations General Assembly in 2013 that homosexuality is one of the “biggest threats to human existence.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71454\" style=\"width: 894px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1203591190\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71453\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71454\" data-attachment-id=\"71454\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/screen-shot-2016-05-26-at-12-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?fit=884%2C621&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"884,621\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-05-26 at 12.05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?fit=884%2C621&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71454 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?resize=884%2C621\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-05-26 at 12.05\" width=\"884\" height=\"621\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?w=884&amp;ssl=1 884w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?resize=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-12.05.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gambia is located on the west coast of Africa, bordered by Senegal and the Atlantic Ocean.<em> Google Maps</em></p></div>\n<p>“The president of the Gambia has been saying that any gay person that come to the Gambia — we will slit your throat.

He could lose his international student status and then become undocumented,” Simjee said. “The previous attorney had made kind of a mess with the case; there were glaring issues.”</p>\n<p>The two decided Jammeh should be represented by Public Counsel in Los Angeles because of a special agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Asylum office in L.A. that would allow for Jammeh’s request to be processed more quickly.</p>\n<p>“They have an agreement with the L.A. asylum office to hear their claims by April of the same year, whereas if had he gone with another attorney he would have been on the same schedule as everyone else, and it could take two years or more to get on the asylum calendar,” Simjee said. She went on to explain that the special agreement is because the attorneys at Public Counsel work with the UC Los Angeles School of Law, so for educational purposes students are allowed to go to the asylum hearings, which are scheduled before the end of the academic year.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I couldn’t see any single thing that is ungodly or that is mean about gay people, so I decided that it was something that I was going to change my views on.”<br>\n— Alagie Jammeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>After visiting Los Angeles to meet with his lawyer every week for about four months, Jammeh travelled to the asylum office in early April for an interview that lasted approximately four hours. Two weeks later he returned to learn whether his request for asylum would be granted.</p>\n<p>“It was this long wait. The lady before me, her case was filed to immigration court … I was scared because my case, if they deny it, has to go through immigration court, which I have to present again and do all those paper work all over again,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>But he was recommended for approval, pending a background check to ensure he had no ties to any terrorist organization and held no criminal record. Three days later, Jammeh’s request for political asylum was granted.</p>\n<p>Jammeh felt a responsibility to his supporters to make sure everything went smoothly throughout the asylum application process, according to Simjee.</p>\n<p>“He was still so nervous and there were so many pieces that were up in the air,” Simjee said. “He just cared so much about all the other people that were invested in him.”</p>\n<p>Though Jammeh can now work in the U.S., apply for scholarships, eventually become a permanent resident and no longer have to fear for his safety, he said he had mixed feelings when he received the news his asylum was granted because he can now never return to Gambia.</p>\n<p>“I am going to miss the Gambia itself,” he said. “Everything about that country. You know, they also call the Gambia the smiling coast of Africa because almost everyone you meet, everyone is smiling. It doesn’t matter how their day is, terrible or bad or good, they are always smiling.”</p>\n<p>Though Jammeh is still in touch with his mother, he no longer hears from any of his 17 siblings, many of whom called him shortly after his Facebook post in 2014 to share their disappointment over his pro-LGBT statement.</p>\n<p>“Eventually my whole family stopped talking to me at the same time; that was the toughest part of all this thing,” Jammeh said. “[They ask] is the American government trying to influence me, trying to change me … This has nothing to do with the American government, this has nothing to do with friends here. This is about me. This is about me evolving. This is about me learning new things in my college, this is about me trying to accept people.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh said his only family is the people at UCSB who have reached out to support him over the last two years, but that they can never replace his brothers and sisters in Gambia.</p>\n<p>“Family is family, you know. You grew up with these people; this is blood. You know them from your childhood to becoming an adult to traveling and everyone has been there whether you are down or up,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>With graduation just three weeks out, Jammeh said he fears having to start a new life when his time at UCSB comes to a close.</p>\n<p>“You have to build a whole new family all over again; that’s terrifying,” he said. “Some of the people that I met here, like David Whitman, the bond we have, it’s going to last forever. The bond that I have with Simran and Mary Jacob … They don’t see me as another student, they see me as their friend, as their child.”</p>\n<p>Simran Singh, director of the office of international students and scholars (OISS) where Jammeh now works, said she and Mary Jacob, senior associate dean for student affairs, made it their goal to give Jammeh as normal a life as they could.</p>\n<p>“There’s no way he doesn’t miss his family because he does. He’s a kid with 17 brothers and sisters and all of the sudden he has nobody,” Singh said. “So we’ve tried our best to give him an atmosphere where he can be himself.”</p>\n<p>Singh said she saw Jammeh “taxed to the limit” throughout the asylum application process.</p>\n<p>“You’re put in front of a person who is going to challenge everything you say, and to have the mental strength and ability to sit before somebody and actually be able to recite what’s happened to you in your life in the past, and be able to come out the way he did: phenomenal,” Singh said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s no way he doesn’t miss his family because he does. He’s a kid with 17 brothers and sisters and all of the sudden he has nobody.” — Simran Singh</p></blockquote>\n<p>When she learned Jammeh had been living out of his car, Jacob invited him to stay in her home during Spring Quarter 2015, during which time she said it took time for him to begin to feel comfortable because he didn’t want to take advantage of her hospitality.</p>\n<p>“So I made him a dish that comes from Senegal; his mom is from Senegal, so I made this stew,” Jacob said. “He said it was good. It wasn’t spicy enough. I made it pretty hot, but it wasn’t hot enough, but that I think that made him very, very happy because he couldn’t believe that I would do something like that for him.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh said he does not want people to just feel sorry for him, but instead hopes people will talk to him as they would any other student on campus.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons I am staying on an extra quarter is to have the experiences of college life without worrying about my [asylum] papers, without worrying about other stuff, but just be a student,” he said. “I wanted that so bad. I wanted to go to school, come do your homework, Friday night go have drink with friends.”</p>\n<p>Dave Whitman, director of LGBT services at the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity, has worked closely with Jammeh over the last year, sometimes checking in with him multiple times a week to inquire into his well-being, manage angry family members, organize fundraising or arrange speaking engagements.</p>\n<p>Whitman said the majority of students at UCSB can’t even begin to “wrap their heads around” the sacrifices Jammeh has made.</p>\n<p>“There hasn’t been a UCSB student in collective memory that has gone through what he’s gone through, and so it’s a huge moment to honor allyship,” Whitman said. “I’ve never met an ally like him.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71448\" style=\"width: 370px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71448\" data-attachment-id=\"71448\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/alagie-jammeh-by-jenny-luo-online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh 5/26\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71448\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-682x1024.jpg?resize=360%2C540\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"360\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<h1>                     A LOW POINT</h1>\n<p>Prior to reaching out to the university for assistance, Jammeh struggled on his own, searching for financial support that would enable him to stay in school. He applied for dozens of scholarships, but was denied each time because he was not a citizen or permanent resident in the U.S. Jammeh was alone, living out of his car, studying in the library, skipping meals.</p>\n<p>Unwilling to drop out of school for fear of being an embarrassment to his country and unable to return home to Gambia, Jammeh began contemplating suicide.</p>\n<p>“There was a point where I give up, literally give up,” Jammeh said. “I’m not going to drop out of school, that’s not an option for me. I’m not going to go back to Gambia, that’s not an option for me either. I’m not going to do anything. What I am going to do now is just end everything, just commit suicide,” he said.</p>\n<p>Jammeh was standing on the Goleta Pier at 1 a.m. determined to end his life in the ocean when he received a call from a friend. According to Jammeh, the conversation was nothing special. They talked about “stupid stuff,” but it was enough to make him reconsider taking his life.</p>\n<p>“It’s God telling me something through this guy. There is more to you than this, there is more to life than committing suicide. Committing suicide is not going to solve your problems … it’s also going to be a win for the people in the Gambia,” Jammeh said. “So stay on and fight. If you believe in what you said, just keep on fighting.”</p>\n<p>Despite the strain of being homeless and unable to pay his university expenses, Jammeh maintained a GPA well above average.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to give the government of the Gambia something to just say ‘Oh, no we didn’t cut his funding because of what he said on Facebook, but we cut his funding because he wasn’t doing too well in school,’ he said. “I was sleeping in my car, doing all that stuff, but I never have a C.”</p>\n<p>Singh said that after helping for some time, the Gambian embassy in Washington eventually stopped responding to OISS’ requests.</p>\n<p>“There have been other asylum cases but … here there were threats, but the threats were made indirectly, so even for us to prove that this was happening became very difficult,” she said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Eventually my whole family stopped talking to me at the same time — that was the toughest part of all this thing.”                  — Alagie Jammeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jammeh took a class with Sharon Farmer, chair of the history department, while he was living out of his car. Farmer said Jammeh’s self-determination enabled him to overcome the many challenges he’s faced.</p>\n<p>“On top of the financial strain, there was the whole emotion strain of his family,” Farmer said. “It seems to me that anybody who can balance all of those things and still make it through that term and a half when he was living in his car could balance the [asylum] application process on top of that.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh said it was difficult to seek out counseling because of the stigma associated with it at home in Gambia.</p>\n<p>“We have this belief that counseling is for people with mental problems,” he said. “People are asking me to go to counseling, but I’m like no I’m not going to go to counseling. I don’t have a mental problem. I have a problem with my government and a problem with my family, but mentally it’s draining and it’s tough to deal with, but I think I can deal with it by myself.”</p>\n<p>While Jammeh did eventually visit the Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) center, he said he felt the experience was “a waste of time,” because the staff member he spoke with didn’t understand his culture.</p>\n<p>“Counseling has to hire people that understand about international students because, my first person that I was talking to had no clue about anything that I was talking about,” Jammeh said. “I don’t blame them for not knowing my culture, but the university has to spend to teach these people about diversity so international students will feel safe to go and talk to them.”</p>\n<p>Farmer said the faculty and staff should know the protocol for how best to help a distressed student.</p>\n<p>“[We need] to constantly inform students that there’s a place to turn because there’s a lot of mental health issues these days and we need to recognize them and get people to the help they need,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jammeh said it is incredibly important for students to watch for warning signs that their peers are in distress and talk to them about what they are going through.</p>\n<p>“When you see someone is not acting right, you just have to make an effort to talk to them,” Jammeh said. “‘Hey, what’s going on? Is everything ok?’ Those things, people see these as a small things, but they really help. When my friend called me and talked to me, that stopped everything. It’s like I was reborn again.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71449\" style=\"width: 370px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71449\" data-attachment-id=\"71449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/alagie-jammeh-by-jenny-luo-online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh 5/26\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71449\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-682x1024.jpg?resize=360%2C540\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"360\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<h1>A NEW HOME</h1>\n<p>The first of his siblings to graduate high school, Jammeh will again break new ground in his family on June 12, becoming the first to obtain a college degree when he graduates with a Bachelor of Arts in global studies.</p>\n<p>Jammeh said the commencement date has “crept up” on him. He has plans to spend the summer break studying for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and then later apply to graduate school at UC Berkeley, USC, Columbia and Princeton.</p>\n<p>“My ultimate goal is to be able to work in the United Nations where I will impact people’s lives. I will have a voice,” Jammeh said. “My hope is to become a human rights advocate all over the world, not just for gay rights but human rights in general: women’s rights, children’s rights and other rights.”</p>\n<p>Jacob, senior associate dean for student affairs, said Jammeh could be an influential activist for gender equality in West Africa.</p>\n<p>“He can play a role as a man from that part of the world to advocate on behalf of women as any ally in forms and ways that women might not be listened to but he, as a man, could,” Jacob said. “If there were a change in government [in Gambia] maybe it would be safe enough for him to return home to work there. If not there, then maybe in neighboring countries.</p>\n<p>Whitman, director of LGBT services, described Jammeh as endlessly insightful, loving and gracious — an “old soul” who he will look up to for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>Whitman said he hopes Jammeh’s story will remind people of their own potential for giving back and reaffirm their gratitude for comfort and safety.</p>\n<p>“He had the ability to think freely despite a socialization that would tell him otherwise … he had the power in his sense of self to break out of that,” Whitman said. “How are you giving your heart and mind to someone or something that isn’t about you? He does not identify with the community. It’s not about him. He could have easily just stayed quiet and I don’t see that a lot.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh admitted that it would have been easier to remain in Gambia, where he would likely be married like many of his brothers and sisters, rather than pursuing an education in America. He attributed the decision to leave his old life behind to his desire to have control over his future.</p>\n<p>“If you’re really good at what you do, people will find it very difficult to deny you of what you want,” Jammeh said. “If you’re good at what you do, they will run out of excuses to say no. You have to decide your future for yourself.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh said he aims to be one of the most educated people in Africa, especially in Gambia.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There hasn’t been a UCSB student in collective memory that has gone through what he’s gone through, and so it’s a huge moment to honor allyship.” — Dave Whitman</p></blockquote>\n<p>“I want children who grow up in the Gambia to think that they could become someone,” he said. “The Gambia is not going to be developed by some western or some European or some Chinese country. The Gambia is only going to be developed by the Gambian people, especially people who went to school in America or in the west to go back to Gambia and contribute.”</p>\n<p>According to Jammeh, it will take more than a change in government in Gambia for him to be able to return home. The Gambian people hold a common belief that homosexuaity is a sin and a crime against humanity.</p>\n<p>“Someone has to be advocating and talking to these communities and tell them, ‘Hey, I have a gay friend and he is normal, he thinks like you. He is smart. He is compassionate. He is loving,’” Jammeh said. “I’m really, really an optimistic person. Ten years ago, if you tell someone gay marriage is going to be legal in all 50 states in the United States, they would be like ‘What are you talking about?’ But it happened.”</p>\n<p>Though Jammeh admits that his hopes may not be fulfilled in his lifetime, he has faith that one day the people of Gambia will treat all individuals with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping … I will wake up one day and see in the news that being gay is okay all over the world, being gay is okay in Gambia and gay people could go to work, without being discriminated against, go to church or go to mosque and pray without being discriminated against, do anything they want to do without being discriminated against. That would make me very, very happy,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>Inspired in his childhood by activists like Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr., Jammeh says he has only begun his journey.</p>\n<p>“I have a dream and that dream is not accomplished. I’m not even halfway there yet,” Jammeh said. “I’m not going to stop.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, May 26, 2016, edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> initially <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-07-28/international-student-alagie-jammeh-risks-life-to-speak-out-against-homophobia/\">reported</a> about Alagie Jammeh on July 28, 2015.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71453\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71453\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/","id":3605,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3604,3603,3602],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"route":"/categories/news/feature","highestPage":9}},"__N_SSG":true}
