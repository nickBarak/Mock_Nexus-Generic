With many UCSB students coming from an immigrant background, often with relatives who had never heard of Thanksgiving prior coming to the United States, their Thanksgivings reflect a diverse cultural background.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> spoke with students who immigrated or have parents who immigrated to the U.S. to learn how they integrate their families’ traditions with those of the customary Thanksgiving practices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year mathematics major Alejandro Stawsky said when his parents first migrated to the U.S. from Uruguay, they didn’t originally celebrate Thanksgiving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we first came here, they had no idea what Thanksgiving was,” Stawsky said. “I would go to school and then I would come back home and ask, ‘Are we doing Thanksgiving?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stawsky said his family now mixes Thanksgiving traditions with its Jewish background by celebrating a Shabbat dinner, the Jewish Sabbath meal, on the Friday after Thanksgiving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During Shabbat, we incorporate Thanksgiving,” Stawsky said. “We make tortas de papa, bourekas, baba ghanoush and go around the table saying what we’re thankful for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year global studies and political science double major Kajol Raju said her Punjabi family spends Thanksgiving at her grandparents’ house with a meal of traditional Indian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have turkey, and my aunt makes a ham and mashed potatoes, and then my aunts or grandma will make Indian food like curry chicken or tandoori chicken, and we’ll have sweets like gulab jamun.” Raju said. “After, we throw on an Indian movie and dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year anthropology and art history double major Diana Torres Luevanos said for her Mexican family, the phrase “vamos a comer,” which means “let’s eat,” signifies Thanksgiving.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first arrived to the States, I didn’t really celebrate Thanksgiving how everyone did,” Torres Luevanos said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Torres Luevanos said today, though, Thanksgiving is an important family tradition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We now get together every year in our church and have a whole ceremony on giving thanks,” Torres Luevanos said. “Then we eat tamales, arroz, frijoles and a bunch of Mexican food; sometimes my sister even makes fresas con crema, which is strawberries and cream.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year mathematics major Armin Mahini said he and his Iranian parents combine typical Thanksgiving dinner with Persian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Typically we have tahdig, which is a crispy rice dish, but there’s also American food,” Mahini said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year biochemistry major Allysa Foot’s mother is Vietnamese and her father is Honduran. Foot said Thanksgiving is her favorite holiday because it is one of the few occasions in which her family can “appreciate the differences” and celebrate the “beauty” behind the different cultures involved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My mom’s side of the family will make seafood like crawfish and crab or clams and oysters … and my dad’s side of the family makes tamales or enchiladas,” Foot said. “They truly give thanks this way by being able to come together and embrace one another and their differences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foot said Thanksgiving reminds her of being “enveloped in a blanket.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re enveloped in this total complete warmth, and it’s comforting, and it’s safe and it’s beautiful,” Foot said. “It’s home. That’s what it is.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66806\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66806\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/","id":3636,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[3635,3634,3633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Resident Assistants Give First Years Advice","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Huynh.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Huynh.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Balancing college courses and new extracurricular activities is hard enough as it is, but living with one, maybe even two roommates for the first time can add a whole new layer of stress.

studies major Nicole Willard</p></div>\n<p>Their advice:</p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em>: What is the best piece of advice you can give a freshman moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh</em>: Bring only what you need and be mindful that you’re sharing the room. It’s helpful to communicate with your roommate(s) before moving in so you can organize who is bringing what and avoid possibly bringing two fridges!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> “Just do it!!” Shia LaBeouf hits the nail on the head with this statement when it comes to being involved. When you first move in, you will feel intimidated by the whole experience. But don’t coop yourself up in your room! Your dorm intentionally plans many programs the first week of move-in so you can be social and meet new people. You will have such a better experience when you put yourself out there, and you could possibly make lifelong friends! Don’t be afraid to introduce yourself and get to know other people.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki</em>: The best piece of advice I can give to a freshman moving into the dorms is to make an effort to get to know the rest of the people on your floor or building. Some of these people will be your best friends for life. Also, don’t forget to take it all in. Moving into your first college dorm can get pretty overwhelming, but as long as you remain optimistic and hopeful, you can definitely make the most of your time here.</p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What are some things freshmen often forget to pack when moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Get yourself some baby oil! Once you walk along the beautiful beaches of Santa Barbara, you will learn about the sticky tar that is almost impossible to get off of the bottom of your feet. Baby oil does the trick, and it will save you the pain of scrubbing those toes forever!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> Freshmen forget to bring air freshener! Sometimes those rooms get smelly and no one wants to be “that room.” I know a lot of freshmen also forget to bring business attire, for job interviews and such. Last thing, stamps!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What are some belongings freshmen often move in with that won’t be useful?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshmen definitely do not need to bring a printer since UCSB offers 200 free pages a quarter at various printing labs. Check out the free resources your campus offers!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Don’t bring clothes you don’t need! When you go visit your family for breaks, you can switch out clothes for the different seasons. This will give you so much more space for you and your roommates!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen who don’t participate in the “party scene” get involved?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> RAs work really hard to plan programs weekly for residents to who don’t want to party. Residents can suggest ideas and even organize the programs with their RAs. If freshmen want to get involved, there’s SO MANY leadership and volunteer opportunities at UCSB such as Hall Council, RHA, Associated Students and various interest clubs!<br>\n<em>Isozaki:</em> There are plenty of organizations on campus that are excited and welcoming to new first-year members, ranging from activist groups to cultural groups to dance teams to video game clubs. Finding a job is a great way to get work experience, make friends and stay active. It’s also very possible to be involved in the party scene without drinking or doing drugs. The campus climate of UCSB is not about who drinks the most, it’s about having a good time.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki: </em>There is so much you can do. I think there is a strong misconception that every single person parties at UCSB, it’s definitely not true. There are so many student organizations that you can get involved in. If you log onto orgsync.com you can find a huge list of the many clubs and organizations we have on campus. Many of the RAs create programs that will have alternatives to the party scene. You will have many opportunities that will cater to your needs and interests.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen learn to get along with their new roommate(s)?</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is super important to have an open and honest discussion in the first few days you are there. Set some ground rules, and stick to them. There have been too many instances where one roommate doesn’t like something the other roommate is doing so they go ask their RA to fix it for them. When that happens, I don’t intervene until I know they have talked to their roommate about it. Also, being passive aggressive doesn’t work! Don’t do it. If you have a problem, try to be an adult and find a solution yourself. Also, sometimes it is just easier to let the small things go. If you have a mutual understanding and follow the rules you set at the beginning of the year, everything should be fine.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> I think the main thing is just to have respect for one another. Having healthy communication and remaining transparent whenever it is necessary definitely promotes a positive living environment. Try to make an effort to get to know your roommate(s). I suggest to go to programs your RA plans together or find a place to eat in Isla Vista that you both have not tried yet.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What’s a common mistake freshmen often make?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshman should take advantage of the fresh new start that college gives them. They should reach out to others, be open-minded and try new things. The person you were in high school does not have to be the person you are in college. You literally can reinvent yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> Not buying a U-lock for one’s bike! We are a biking campus and having a U-lock helps keep your bike from getting stolen. Also, choose a major based on passion, not pay, because there are so many opportunities in every major to excel in great things.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> Are there any other tips you would like to share with the class of 2019?</p>\n<p><em>Hunyh:</em> Set some academic and personal goals for yourself before starting college. Think about what you really want to achieve by the end of your first year and work towards it! It’s not bad to get lost or go with the flow, but make sure you’re always working towards something great!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is imperative that freshmen learn time management and remember to not put off studying until finals week! Meet your professors and hall directors, go to office hours and don’t be afraid to use all of the campus resources, because they are there for you!</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> Your freshman year goes by so fast! Take advantage of every single opportunity that comes your way. Remember to just breathe when things get tough. We have a wonderful community that will support your endeavors.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, August 27, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

international bestselling author Malala Yousafzai at a sold-out event on June 27 at the Arlington Theatre, with simulcasts at Campbell Hall and The New Vic.</p>\n<p>Seventeen-year-old Yousafzai grew up in Pakistan’s formerly Taliban-controlled Swat Valley where she advocated for women’s education after the Taliban declared no girls would be allowed to attend school. In response, a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012. Having made a full recovery, she now continues her secondary education and activism in the United Kingdom. In October 2014, Yousafzai became the youngest Nobel laureate in history.</p>\n<p>The event consisted of a short explanation my Yousafzai regarding her life and activism, followed by a discussion and Q&amp;A session moderated by event sponsor and Malala Foundation board member Susan McCaw. McCaw presented questions pre-submitted by students at UCSB, Santa Barbara Middle School, Montecito Union Elementary and Harding University Partnership School.</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said the Swat Valley was “paradise” before the Taliban took control, but terrorism brought “darkness” to her community.</p>\n<p>“My life was a happy life and, suddenly, things changed,” Yousafzai said. “A villain came. This villain in our story was terrorism — Talibanization. Our peaceful valley turned from a place of tourism to a place of terrorism. More than 400 schools were destroyed at that time. People were flogged, killed; women were not allowed to go outside, girls’ education was banned and life became so hard.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said her father allowed her to go to school even though most girls in the Swat Valley did not, providing her with the foundation that allows her to advocate for fair treatment and education for women.</p>\n<p>“He treated me equally as my brothers,” Yousafzai said. “He allowed me to get education, and I was one of the luckiest girls who got this opportunity … He believed that if we want our society to go forward, if we want our country to succeed, we need to empower women.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she has fought for her own education and universal women’s education because it leads to individual empowerment.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, in a patriarchal society, women lack identity,” Yousafzai said. “They are wives, sisters, mothers, but they are never allowed to have the identity of an individual. I did not want to suffer through the situation of being only called the wife or the mother to someone.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she is “not a lone voice” in her advocacy for women’s education, because she represents all those who are denied the opportunities she seeks to create.</p>\n<p>“When I go and see presidents and prime ministers I say, ‘don’t think this is only this one girl, Malala, speaking to you, these are the girls in Nigeria, these are the girls in Kenya who do not get the opportunity to get their secondary school education,’” Yousafzai said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Effie Sklavenitis said the event taught her the importance of speaking on behalf of others to create change.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a voice, and just because you’re one person doesn’t mean you’re alone. It means that you have to speak up if you want things to change.” Sklavenitis said. “Even when people speak up against you, you still have to keep on talking and keep on expressing your points.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she sees many students in countries with universal education who do not value and take advantage of their opportunities.</p>\n<p>“It’s really sad because, one side of the world, children are fighting, children are struggling for the right to go to school … even if they have to pay, even if they have to travel long distances, even if they have to face the difficulty of having no teachers or sitting in a classroom with 90 to 100 students,” Yousafzai said. “I think all the children who have this opportunity should be very thankful.”</p>\n<p>Third-year geology major Cassidy Meehan said the event prompted her to realize the value of the education she continues to receive.</p>\n<p>“It really made me feel inspired to take advantage of my education,” Meehan said. “It really made me realize, ‘wow, I’m really lucky to have this.’”</p>\n<p>According to Yousafzai, cultures that do not allow for or support women’s education can and should be changed.</p>\n<p>“These cultures and traditions, they are not sent by God from the sky and said that this is your culture and you have to follow it,” Yousafzai said. “It is we people who have made these cultures, and we have the right and duty to change them when they go against basic human rights.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and marine biology double major Francesca Pezzullo said she agreed with Yousafzai that culture should not inhibit human rights.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really interesting to say that we can change our culture, we can change our traditions,” Pezzullo said. “It’s not a good thing to hold on to if it’s impeding on people’s human rights. It’s very important for people to understand that you can’t just hold onto it because it’s familiar. That doesn’t mean it’s right.”</p>\n<p>Pezzullo said the event showed her, despite Yousafzai’s influence and achievements, that the activist is also a “very normal” teenage girl.</p>\n<p>“She seemed like a very genuine person,” Pezzullo said. “She’s exceptional in her situation, but she seems like a down-to-earth person.”</p>\n<p>Sklavenitis said the event inspired her to consider how students’ actions in the United States affect the fight for basic human rights in other parts of the world.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for people to think about their own societies and their own actions every day and how that affects the bigger picture and how that affects anything from women’s rights to education for children, because everything is connected,” Sklavenitis said. “We may live in different places, but at the end of they day we live on the same planet.”</p>\n<p>Pezzullo said Yousafzai’s story demonstrates the effect one activist can have on an issue.</p>\n<p>“You have to be the one to see the change that you want to see happen, which is something that is hard for people to wrap their heads around because they feel like their life is so important personally, they don’t realize you have to actually do it yourself,” Pezzullo said. “Malala is a girl who just did it herself.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64212\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64212\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/","id":3442,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[3441,3440,3439],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Psychology Alum Turns Singer-Songwriter: The Beauty of the Party-Study-Play Music Balance at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"More than any other California school, UC Santa Barbara students have a tendency to get defensive about their alma mater.

It’s a delicate topic. Is this a party school, or is this a world-class research university? The answer usually gets tied down in the celebrated Gaucho motto, “Work hard, play hard.”</p>\n<p>But what this four letter chant fails to observe is the enormous artistic community that is alive on campus and in our quaint seatown Isla Vista. I.V.’s special aura of friendliness and creativity allows things like Bean Night, the Catalyst Literary Arts Magazine and beach drum circles to exist. The magic of being a student at UCSB is that the wise are able to benefit from three interlocking environments: red-cup atmosphere, reputable research and a music scene that never stops playing.</p>\n<p>Enter Sarah LaForge, a UCSB alumnae from 2011. Inspired by her father’s career as a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapist, LaForge went straight to the Psych Info table when she came for Spring Insight in 2007. As a senior, she landed a research assistant position in the Psych Department.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Sarah was great to work with . . . a bright, inquisitive research assistant. I always looked forward to working with her,” said Kim Hartson, a graduate student advised by Psychology Professor David Sherman. “Sarah conducted a number of studies with me, including her URCA project looking at whether listening to heart sounds reduced physiological stress and improved performance.”</p>\n<p>Like a true Gaucho, being an R.A. wasn’t LaForge’s only extra-curricular activity. The UCSB alumnae’s senior year was a mix of being president of Manley Co-op, working on a senior’s thesis and playing music, among other things. “Music became a hobby my senior year at UC Santa Barbara,” said LaForge. “Through the drum circles on the beach [and] the noon Storke shows, there’s such a good music community in Isla Vista. It became a side project along with all this work I was doing to graduate.”</p>\n<p>Upon graduation in 2011, LaForge headed straight into the career world, going into social work for disabled and autistic children in Riverside, California. “It was overwhelming . . . it was so hard on me emotionally that I felt like I had no outlet at the end of the day. I was so worried all the time about these kids,” she said.</p>\n<p>Facilitating her hobby found at UCSB, LaForge ended her social work term and moved to L.A. to write music. Taking on the stage name of “Lucy,” she formed “Lucy &amp; La Mer” in 2012 as a solo act. Other musicians have been added into the mix in the last couple of years, including Grammy-nominated drummer Matt Cook and bassist Jon Lee Keenan. Lucy &amp; La Mer has played in 10 countries throughout Europe and recently just finished a San Diego to Seattle tour with Australian musician Dolly Denko.</p>\n<p>Throughout it all, she’s kept in contact with her mentors at UCSB, and even played at Hartson’s wedding. “I remember my fiancé at the time and I were talking about potentially having a band play at our wedding and Sarah had just posted a new song on Facebook so I sent him a link to her music and he liked it,” said Hartson.</p>\n<p>“It just so happened that Sarah was playing a show in L.A. that weekend so we drove down to see what she was like live and we loved it. I remember asking her at the end of the set to play our wedding and she was excited to do so and we were thrilled. It was really lovely to have such a personal connection to the band playing the wedding. It wasn’t just hiring some random band and we knew we could count on her to really make the wedding special and she did.”</p>\n<p>Besides performing at weddings for good friends, LaForge funds her traveling adventures by hosting amateur music lessons for small children. “In L.A. there’s a lot of parents who want their toddlers taught what music is. I bring fun percussionist instruments, teach them a few chords, and say, ‘hey let’s write a song together.’” She also recently landed a spot as backup singer for 49-year old EDM legend Moby.</p>\n<p>While her life is very different from the days at UCSB testing heart sounds, LaForge hasn’t lost the affinity for study she gained in her degree. In an interview with UCSB’s psych department newsletter, she said, “There’s a surprising amount of research within the music business. Finding your audience is just like finding your sample group – age, location, interest, disinterests, are all important when creating marketing strategies. You’re always hypothesizing about how your group will react and asking questions as you plan.”</p>\n<p>LaForge’s future plans involve combining her UCSB Psychology degree with her passion and training to become a music therapist. But for now, she’s enjoying the hectic lifestyle as a freelance teacher and musician-on-the-road.</p>\n<p>“After you stop school, you’re looking for something [to do]. I don’t have a test Friday, so what am I looking towards, what do I wanna work on. Music became that,” said LaForge. “You never feel balanced, necessarily. But you feel thriving. You’re doing a million things at once, you’re juggling. It’s not as structured as being in school or having a 9-5 job.

Villanueva said the president’s executive order and DACA have provided her with opportunities that might have not otherwise been available to an undocumented student.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of people who advocated tirelessly for [Obama’s executive order] including myself and a lot of people I know,” Villanueva said. “DACA has been great for me because I can get a job now and it makes it a lot easier for me to get involved in advocating for the immigrant community.”</p>\n<p>But Villanueva said the new immigration policy still leaves her fearing for her parents, worrying whether or not they will be deported.</p>\n<p>“It won’t really change much for me because my parents won’t be safe from deportations,” Villanueva said. “They will still be vulnerable because local enforcement will still be collaborating with [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement], and the detention and deportation quotas have not changed under this new executive order.”</p>\n<p>According to Villanueva, the executive order’s inability to provide protection to the remainder of Isla Vista’s undocumented population is a reflection of the continuing inadequacy of immigration policy.</p>\n<p>“I know a lot of folks who don’t qualify for [DACA] for a lot of different reasons,” Villanueva said. “For me, that highlights how much our community is still in danger of unjust detention and deportation.”</p>\n<p>Adriana, a third-year English major and undocumented student whose name has been changed on condition of anonymity, said she would stress constantly over the possibility of being deported before she applied for DACA. Adriana said she remembers the fear she felt in one situation when she had a run-in with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) while traveling from Arizona to Los Angeles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59047\" style=\"width: 343px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59047\" data-attachment-id=\"59047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12-04-2014-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=2832%2C4256&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2832,4256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1417639606\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"19\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0769230769231\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"undocumented by kenneth song for 12.04.2014 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59047\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1-681x1024.jpg?resize=333%2C500\" alt=\"undocumented by kenneth song for 12.04.2014 1\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?resize=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 681w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Many undocumented students struggle with fear of deportation and finding work, but DACA may allow them to breathe easier — at least for the remainder of Obama’s term. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I was so scared when that happened,” Adriana said. “But luckily the immigration officer was nice. He let us go because I told him I was returning home.”<br>\nAccording to Adriana, since applying to DACA she no longer worries about being deported and is able to live her life more freely by going to school, working a job and traveling without fear.</p>\n<p>“I can come out of the shadows,” Adriana said. “I’m not afraid to travel and I’ve been traveling back and forth from Isla Vista to Los Angeles.”</p>\n<p>Oscar Zarate, a second-year economics and political science major and an undocumented student, said his status has made it difficult for him to afford college because of his limited eligibility to scholarships and financial aid. According to Zarate, he can now obtain the work permit necessary to find a job to help pay for a postsecondary education as a result of Obama’s executive order.</p>\n<p>“Due to Obama’s new immigration policies, I can work which is a big help,” Zarate said. “Now I can be a desk attendant, and that helps a lot with college expenses.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Martinez, a second-year sociology and math major and an undocumented student, said she sees the extension of DACA eligibility and work permit opportunities as positive, but still worries because the added protection for undocumented immigrants will only last for the remaining two years of Obama’s presidency.</p>\n<p>“Obama’s presidency is slowly coming to an end, so there is still that concern of what is going to happen when a new president comes into office,” Martinez said. “I don’t know what kind of legislation the new president will try to implement.”</p>\n<p>Zarate said he also shares the concern that Obama’s new immigration orders are only temporary.</p>\n<p>“These immigration policies that have been applied are not forever,” Zarate said. “I fear for the future of the undocumented student.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, December 4, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Also, the plan to provide housing for UCSB staff in I.V. is not related to self-governance and is in fact solely a function and idea of the University.</em></p>\n<p><em> In addition, an earlier version of this article stated that “Abboud said the [Area Planning Committee]’s potential implementation would likely be through the university and would be responsible for infrastructure maintenance and the distribution of student and non-student residents throughout I.V.” when in fact the Area Planning Commission would function through the County Board of Supervisors and potential future Special District and would not be responsible for infrastructure maintenance. It also has nothing to do with the university. </em></p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus <em>regrets these errors.]</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

to a UC statement released this past Thursday. According to the UCSA petition, the association will “actively lobby” UCOP and the Board of Regents, will write letters to Senators and Congressmen “expressing the resolution’s sentiments” and will conduct a system-wide survey to gather input about President Barack Obama’s “Plan to Make College More Affordable” and university rating system, and relay the feedback to the US Department of Education.</p>\n<p>UCOP spokesperson Brooke Converse said the UC would work to minimize the increase in tuition by seeking additional funds from the state.</p>\n<p>“We are aware of the petition,” Converse said. “No one likes a tuition increase, least of all the University, but we hope to work with students to advocate for additional funding from the state to offset the potential increase.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Despite state funding increasing over the last two years, the UC still faces a long-term gap between projected revenues and its basic funding needs for educational programs.</p>\n<p>The UC still remains $460 million below its 2007–‘08 level of state funding, and is below what it needs to continue to meet its commitment to admitting all eligible California students and to “preserve the quality of a UC education,” according to the UC statement released last week.</p>\n<p>The UC also stated that additional state funding could allow UC to avoid a tuition increase.</p>\n<p>According to first-year pre-biology student Ashley Tringali, paying more tuition right now is justified and will likely pay off later on.</p>\n<p>“I have been reading articles about the changes that they want to make and I feel like right now we might have to pay more, but I am investing my money into a good education and hopefully I’ll be able to use that education,” Tringali said.</p>\n<p>However, first-year economics and global studies double major Kayla Saliba said she agrees with UCSA’s petition to put financial responsibility onto the state.</p>\n<p>“The state should not be cutting the money. But if that is not an option, then if you are cutting the funds that the school is getting, what is going to happen to the school?” Saliba said. “Already students and teachers are scrambling for resources. How are we going to pay for things that the university needs?”</p>\n<p>Tringali said increasing tuition to improve the UC is a worthwhile investment.</p>\n<p>“I know the UCs … and especially here at UC Santa Barbara, we have great research and opportunities and connections,” Tringali said. “I feel like if I need to pay more now, yeah it might be bad financially for me right now, but I know it is going to pay off later. I am totally fine with investing in my future.”</p>\n<p>But according to Saliba, the state is obliged to provide affordable education for their public universities.</p>\n<p>“We should be getting more money, but it should not be coming from the students,” Saliba said, “it should be coming from the government, and that is a basic thing I feel we need to start doing as a nation.”</p><div

each year and would result in baseline UC tuition totaling $15,564 per student per year by the 2019-2020 academic year.</p></div>\n<p>The UC Office of the President and UC Board of Regents announced today that the Board would consider a plan to incrementally increase tuition by five percent annually for five years at its bi-monthly meeting on Nov 19.</p>\n<p>The plan assumes that the state will increase its base budget support for UC by four percent annually through the 2019-2020 academic year, contributions that will amount to roughly 1.7 percent of the UC’s annual budget.</p>\n<p>A UCOP statement stated that the proposed five percent annual increase is a “ceiling figure” and that the entire proposal hinges on the amount of money appropriated to the UC budget by Sacramento. According to UCOP, the plan stipulates each five percent increase would equate to roughly $500 more in additional charges each year and would result in baseline UC tuition totaling $15,564 per student per year by the 2019-2020 academic year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCOP listed various reasons for the tuition increase in its initial statement on the proposal.

University of California students have been ready, willing, and urging the UC to let students be a part of planning for their future.”</p>\n<p>Napolitano, when asked about the statement, said continuing a tuition freeze with current levels of state support, which she said has declined over the last decade by 27 percent per student, is not feasible.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s unfortunate language. It’s not that at all,” Napolitano said. “It’s not holding anybody hostage, this is where we are … but you can’t have a tuition freeze indefinitely at the current level of state support that we’re receiving.”</p>\n<p>According to Napolitano, given the “dramatically reduced” per student contribution by the state, the UC has been placed in a situation that necessitates a tuition increase or an increase in state funding.</p>\n<p>“The per-student contribution by the state has really been dramatically reduced. I think it’s time to say, ‘Look, we want to maintain ourself as open and accessible, maintain our student aid policy; we want to increase California enrollment and we need to invest in academic quality.’” Napolitano said. “At some point you either increase the state contribution or you have a tuition plan that goes into place.”</p>\n<p>All 10 UC chancellors, including Chancellor Henry T. Yang, also released a joint statement today in support of the proposed increase, citing continuous funding gaps and a decreased budget of $640 million in funds available to UC since 2008.</p>\n<p>“The plan addresses our obligation to students and their families to provide them with the best education possible at the most affordable price.

According to statistics gathered by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZiVslx1Zpce-fvuGn8yvnFz-mH8C2ARHqoMWC8rNPs4/edit?usp=sharing\">a <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey</a> randomly sampling 376 students, 40.7 percent of students have tried some psychoactive prescription drug at least once in their life and 35 percent have tried Adderall at least once, with 25.4 percent noting that they did it specifically for school and only 1.1 percent stating that they used it specifically for ADHD.</p>\n<p>The survey has also found that some students take amphetamine stimulants such as Vyvanse, Dexedrine and Dextrostat as well as benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Klonopin and Ativan to study, for recreation, to treat medical conditions or for other purposes.</p>\n<p>According to Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta, the statistics “sound accurate,” as many students who come to Student Health seek consultation and treatment for ADHD or attention deficit disorder (ADD) either because of concerns about their condition or because they feel medication “can help them study, help them concentrate, can help them prepare for tests.”</p>\n<p>“The percentage of students who say that they have tried it are probably not using the medications as prescribed … but reporting their uses more as experimentation or [to] improve their study habits or study skills,” Kurta said, “particularly for Adderall.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, according to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey, 87.7 percent of students who have used Adderall do not have a prescription.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Between the immediate gratification of a text and computer access and the Internet’s speed [and] the need to be multitasking these options all day long … we tend to distract ourselves quite a lot and don’t give ourselves the opportunity to focus as much. — Jackie Kurta</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kurta said she is concerned about assumptions that many students make about the projected risk of prescription drug abuse, claiming that students wrongly assume that because prescription drug use is widespread, it is safe.</p>\n<p>“These are very potent medications, and they need to be properly assessed, properly diagnosed, properly dosed and properly managed.” Kurta said. “We certainly don’t want to give people the impression that anybody can take anything and it’ll help them. There are risks.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58015\" style=\"width: 314px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"954950762\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58013\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58015\" data-attachment-id=\"58015\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/drugs-front-photo-page-by-kenneth-song_for-11-06-2014-5918/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=2832%2C4256&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2832,4256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415234785\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5918\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58015\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918-681x1024.jpg?resize=304%2C457\" alt=\"Lecturer Kendall Hassemer believes the use of these drugs may be due to increased academic pressure and over-stimulation of students’ current surrounding environment.

People tend to think that there’s a reduced risk with Adderall because so many people are prescribed it when really there are risks involved. You don’t know how your body will respond to it.” Peters also said she doubts many Adderall users have prescriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Are So Many Students Doing It?</strong></p>\n<p>Exercise &amp; Sports Studies 2 (ESS2)/Substance Abuse lecturer Kendall Hassemer said students are facing increasing pressure within the education system to “perform perfectly,” which sets students up for cycles of high anxiety, depression and drug-seeking behavior in order to cope with stress. According to her, these problems are symptomatic of the overstimulation students are inundated with in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>“I do believe that this greater focus on ADD/ADHD is due to increased awareness as well as continual nervous system exposure and overstimulation of the current surrounding environment,” Hassemer said in an email. “Research has shown that internet/communications and electronic devices alter neurotransmitter and brain function over time.”</p>\n<p>Kurta agrees and said she thinks prescription drugs are used among students who do not necessarily have behavioral conditions but in actuality need “a quick fix to be able to blast through [studying].”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s kind of a byproduct of the way our society is now operating in terms of our ability to multitask,” Kurta said. “Between the immediate gratification of a text and computer access and the Internet’s speed [and] the need to be multitasking these options all day long, I think we do in ourselves promote this idea that we can’t focus on any one thing when in fact we tend to distract ourselves quite a lot and don’t give ourselves the opportunity to focus as much.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year economics major Michael, with constant increase in pressures from the university to academically succeed and with pressure at internships or jobs to excel, “study drugs become more and more of a thing” as more students feel as though they must compete with one another.</p>\n<p>“The fact that students know [the dangers] and still take them, even relying on these drugs, just shows the types of environments and pressures that are put on all of the students of the U.S. education system,” he said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have friends that didn’t want to try [prescription drugs] but with the pressures of school and the easy access to them, they ended up using them … They are addictive drugs and if you abuse them, they will be detrimental and they’ll be useless in the context of academics. —Quinn</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second-year engineering major Kenneth said that while the use of study drugs may seem to help, it can create a psychological dependence that would not have been previously there.</p>\n<p>“I have heard from friends I’ve talked to that they are great and even if they don’t make you study harder they make the process more enjoyable,” he said. “On the other hand, some have said that they often think if they had never started [taking these drugs] they wouldn’t need it now.”</p>\n<p>However, according to fourth-year political science major Nikolai, the use of prescription drugs such as Adderall is not as detrimental as some claim it to be.</p>\n<p>“I take Adderall on an occasional basis and it has no apparent long-term detrimental side affects. It has certainly saved my ass on more than one occasion in an academic respect,” Nikolai said. “I feel like it won’t be the last time it will.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Quinn said she thinks that the overuse of drugs, at least at UCSB, stems not just from the pressure to succeed, but also from easy access. She said that even though these drugs are legal, “they are still, very much, drugs.”</p>\n<p>“I have friends that didn’t want to try [prescription drugs] but with the pressures of school and the easy access to them, they ended up using them,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58016\" style=\"width: 395px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1471172757\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58013\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58016\" data-attachment-id=\"58016\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/drugs-front-photo-page-by-kenneth-song_for-11-06-2014-5946/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415235563\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5946\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58016\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946-1024x681.jpg?resize=385%2C256\" alt=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5946\" width=\"385\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey found that 34.8 percent of students have used Adderall at least once and that 18.4 percent of students have used Xanax at least once. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Fixing the Symptoms Instead of Solving the Problem<br>\n</strong><br>\nAccording to Kurta, a lot of students that come to the Alcohol &amp; Drug program find themselves turning to not just “study drugs,” but also to anti-anxiety medication such as Xanax in order to feel relief from stress or trauma.</p>\n<p>“They do talk about the fact that some of their use is prompted by a feeling of some relief from stress, relief from anxiety — many from feelings of depression, or loneliness or traumatic situations that have occurred,” Kurta said.</p>\n<p>Peters agreed and said that widespread use of benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Klonopin and Ativan can lead to detrimental and even possibly fatal results.</p>\n<p>“With Xanax, a lot of people think its fine since it’s so widely prescribed for anxiety, not realizing they’re very potent,” Peters said, “especially when accidentally or purposefully mixed with alcohol, it can be deadly.”</p>\n<p>According to Hassemer, our continuously competitive academic environment coupled with college students’ natural inclination to experiment are both elements that factor into student inclination to abuse pharmaceutical drugs.</p>\n<p>“The high-stress environment of a college campus, linked with exposure to prescription drugs, and even natural curiosity of this age group, makes it more likely for experimentation and dangerous, even life-threatening habits to form,” Hassemer said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak … An anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what’s happening. And a lot of these drugs are that. We’re getting our children through education by anaesthetizing them. — Sir Ken Robinson</p></blockquote>\n<p>So let’s say school is the problem. Then what? When all is said and done, is there anything anyone can do to mitigate the prescription drug problem?</p>\n<p>According to notable author, speaker and international advisor in education Sir Ken Robinson in a Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts (RSA) lecture titled “Changing Education Paradigms,” diagnosis of ADHD has risen in parallel with the growth of standardized testing, a phenomenon which he said is no coincidence.</p>\n<p>“Our children are living in the most intensely stimulating period in the history of the earth,” Robinson said in the lecture. “They’re being besieged with information and calls for their attention from every platform — computers, from iPhones, from advertising hoardings, from hundreds of television channels — and we’re penalizing them now for getting distracted. From what? Boring stuff at school, for the most part.”</p>\n<p>Robinson, who points out that the public school system was modeled to meet the needs of industrialism in the 19th century, advocates for a reassessment of our current education model in order to meet 21st century standards. He also points to Ritalin and Adderall as “quite dangerous drugs” given to students to force them to focus in a model of education that is outdated.</p>\n<p>“And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak … An anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what’s happening,” Robinson said. “And a lot of these drugs are that. We’re getting our children through education by anaesthetizing them.”</p>\n<p>According to Robinson, the increased usage of prescription drugs points to a necessity to change the educational paradigm. This means doing away with Industrial Age methods of schooling such as ringing bells, separate facilities specialized into separate subjects and separating school children by age. Instead, Robinson states that we must start looking at ways to encourage creativity and divergent thinking into the school system.</p>\n<p>Whether his advice rings true or not, one thing is for certain — a significant chunk of students are medicating themselves in order to get by, and unless either students or school systems change, prescription drugs are here to stay.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zDZFcDGpL4U\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>This story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, November 6, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexu<em>s. </em><em>Some names in this article have been changed on condition of anonymity.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/","id":3436,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[3435,3434,3433],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

President Ali Guthy expressed concerns about the structure and operation regarding the OSA.</p>\n<p>“The concern regarding the current structure and operation of the office was ultimately this: if the Student Advocate General is meant to advocate for the entire student body as a whole, how can the elected individual, properly advocate for the rights of the whole student body when only dealing with on-campus issues such as plagiarism and dormitory write-ups?” Garcia said in an email.</p>\n<p>Guthy said that while the OSA conducts specific casework for individual students who encounter disciplinary problems on campus, there could be a better way to serve all students.</p>\n<p>“This type of individualized service is not offered by any other elected executive officer or their staff, considering there are alternative structures within the association that serve to facilitate this need,” Guthy said in an email. “As executives, I believe it is the responsibility of our offices and ourselves to advocate for all UCSB students as opposed to assisting with individual cases because we are elected by the entire student body.”</p>\n<p>Second-year CC] literature major, SAG candidate and current OSA outreach coordinator Ethan Reul said that without casework, the OSA would operate like an “umbrella” for other advocacy groups and would be saddled with additional responsibilities.</p>\n<p>“The SAG would then be responsible for the oversight and management of all these advocacy groups as well as kind of advocating on a more university-wide level as opposed to just the on-campus issues that the OSA currently deals with,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>Guthy also said this new CSA unit would settle in with other advocacy units on campus and broaden the spectrum of student support, which already includes the Legal Resource Center and the Isla Vista Tenants Union.</p>\n<p>“The new unit this bill seeks to create, Campus Student Advocacy (CSA), will fit perfectly within this structure as the CSA would conduct casework to assist students who receive on-campus violations,” Guthy said in an email. “The formation of the CSA would create a holistic approach and structure for advocacy in associated students, as the ‘Advocacy Units’ would now address housing issues, off-campus issues, and on-campus issues.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, this bill would better serve students because it would provide a more cohesive relationship among groups on campus striving to help students.</p>\n<p>“For me, the biggest reason is that this bill proposes a new model that will facilitate a more positive, synchronized relationship between the SAG and now multiple advocacy groups, specializing in different aspects of student rights,” Guthy said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year CCS literature major and former SAG Bailey Loverin said the new bill could take the OSA “five steps backwards” from when it was previously restructured.</p>\n<p>“The new unit will not have the administrative clout of the OSA under the SAG, the SAG will be reduced to a figurehead position, confidentiality could be seriously compromised, you can’t guarantee non-partisan chairs so students could feel unsafe going to the unit, you can’t force them to attend office hours and meetings, the list goes on,” Loverin said in an email.</p>\n<p>Reul said Guthy had initially brought the bill to the OSA, but after the OSA decided not to split the office, Guthy went ahead and presented the bill to the senate. While there was some debate between the two, it ultimately met with compromise.</p>\n<p>“Ali went ahead and decided that she wanted to present it to senate anyway. Technically, it was a professional courtesy that she brought it to us; she did not need to,” Reul said. “However, because she did, we were kind of put off by the fact that she went ahead and did it anyway. So we kind of got into a bit of a heated argument with her and we came to the compromise of postponing, rather than completely eliminating or going through with the bill.”</p>\n<p>Reul said he would support the bill if it were more closely examined and revised, particularly after a new SAG is elected.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that when we do have a Student Advocate General, [they] work more closely with Ali on the creation of this bill so that way when it finally does go through, it’s in the best interest of Associated Students and the student body as a whole,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Attorney General Hector Contreras said the bill in its current form could be deemed unconstitutional according to the A.S. Legal Code and that it would be best to wait until a new SAG is elected before going forward with the bill.</p>\n<p>“If the bill were to be passed as it is now, under my interpretation it would be unconstitutional because it is preventing the Student Advocate General from providing oversight and direction to their office as there is no current elected SAG,” Contreras said in an email.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57926\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57926\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/","id":3437,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[3436,3435,3434],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2014 Midterm Election Results: Capps, Williams Re-elected, GOP Takes Senate","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Santa Barbara County Clerk-Recorder’s Office released its final numbers shortly after 11:30p.m. on election day yesterday evening, posting results for state, federal, and local contests relevant...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57922\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57922\" data-attachment-id=\"57922\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/election-day-by-anna-kodelashvili_for-11-04-2014w-5758/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,798\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415125289\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.04\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Election Day by Anna Kodelashvili_for 11.04.2014w-5758\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57922\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758-1024x680.jpg?resize=500%2C333\" alt=\"Lois Capps, who has retained her seat in the House of Representatives, visited campus yesterday to urge students to vote.

Prop 47, which passed with 58.4 percent of the vote, reduced the penalties for certain drug crimes from felonies to misdemeanors.</p>\n<p>Proposition 45, which requires the state’s Insurance Commissioner’s approval before a health insurer can change its rates, failed to get more than 40.1 percent of the vote. Proposition 46, which required drug testing for physicians, also went down with 67.2 percent of voters saying no.</p>\n<p>In national elections, the Republicans picked up seven seats in the U.S. Senate, gaining a majority in that house for the party for the first time since 2007.

One revision is the inclusion of “dating partners” under the definition of “intimate partners,” allowing victims to seek protection from domestic violence and stalking.</p>\n<p>The Pause for Gun Safety Act would allow friends or family members to seek a temporary “gun violence prevention order” if they fear that someone close to them is posing a threat to themselves or others. The gun violence prevention order would effectively prohibit, for a brief period, a given individual from purchasing or possessing a firearm and grant authorities permission to confiscate firearms already in possession.</p>\n<p>According to Capps, voting certain candidates into office, such as herself, will allow for changes in legislation to happen.</p>\n<p>“I’ve supported legislation ever since I got there; the relationship between gun violence and domestic violence, safety issues and now in this case, allowing a parent or someone else in a position of recognizing someone might be a danger to themselves or others, to intervene in time for the guns to be confiscated,” Capps said.</p>\n<p>Since the events of May 23, Martinez said he has toured the country, visiting 11 states as well as Washington D.C. in a campaign to change state legislation regarding gun safety.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, solving gun violence issues requires more than one answer.</p>\n<p>“There’s no one solution to gun violence; it’s a multifaceted problem,” Martinez said, “There isn’t one solution to this kind of thing. You make changes that incrementally solve the issue.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said voting is a response that is one potential solution to gun violence.</p>\n<p>“Voting matters,” Martinez said. “It’s a black-and-white choice.”</p>\n<p>According to Capps, gun control is not the only pressing issue in this “critical” election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always been a champion for making college more affordable,” Capps said. “We want to make sure that we protect the environment, that we put people to work in projects that will bring our economy forward, take advantage of alternative energy other than fossil fuels. There’s protecting Medicare and social security. There’s all kinds of issues at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, Capps went door-to-door in I.V. to ask community members to vote the next day. This morning, she was up at 5:00 a.m. to hang pamphlets on the doorknobs of the residences in I.V. to remind voters to turn in ballots.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of excitement in this election, so they forget about the ballot, it’s still sitting on top of the refrigerator, and then they say ‘Oh my gosh, I have this ballot here!’ Well they can take it to any polling place,” Capps said, “And there’s several of them around Isla Vista and UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hillel, Saint Michael’s University Church, Saint Mark’s University Parish and Merton Housing Co-Op are all polling places located in I.V., while on-campus voters can go to the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge, the Loma Pelona Center and the Linda Vista Room in Santa Catalina.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/","id":3632,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[3631,3630,3629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"County Approves Fencing Project","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Santa Barbara County Planning Commission voted unanimously yesterday in support of fencing six public parks that line the bluffs of Isla Vista.

Still others have been badly injured in accidental falls, too many to count.”</p>\n<p>Goodman also said the efforts by Morrison and other student and local organizations to put up fencing in I.V. have been inspiring.<br>\n“Their work reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from Margaret Mead,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>“‘Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.’”</p>\n<p>According to Blough, the construction is vital to maintaining safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Overall, I think building these fences is great,” Blough said. “It doesn’t matter what the cost is, what is important is that these fences will save lives.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, October 30, 2014’s print

id=\"caption-attachment-52786\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Peter Vandenbelt/Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Examining Halloween’s recent evolution in Isla Vista, suspicion and uneasiness towards authority paired with extensive rules and restrictions and constraint have led to rising contentions between police and civilians, a common pattern for Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s and early 1990s, the number of attendees skyrocketed. As crowds grew to 25,000 in 1991 and then made a massive leap to 40,000 attendees in 1992, according to the Office of Student Life, the number of accidents, crimes, violations and arrests increased as well. After this drastic surge in attendance, local law enforcement drafted a “Five Year Plan” to help limit the number of party-goers who would flood I.V. the following year in 1993. Similar to the restrictions we see today, the plan came equipped with noise ordinances, confiscation of possibly dangerous props or costumes, barricades and restricted parking, with aims to improve the safety of the community and keep things under control.</p>\n<p>According to Geoff Green, a UCSB alumnus who served as Associated Students president during the 1993-94 academic year, his year in office marked a huge transition towards a significant increase in police and authoritative presence during Halloween. Green said that although the plan has good intentions and the safety measures were needed, students seemed unsure on how Halloween would play out.</p>\n<p>“For the most part, people were onboard with the principle, but concerned with implementation,” Green said, “especially since this was only a couple years after Rodney King and the L.A. Riots — people were suspicious of law enforcement and authority.”</p>\n<p>According to Green, following the increase of police in I.V. caused an increase in the level of resident complaints against police.</p>\n<p>“1993 marked a significant jump in the level of police enforcement in I.V. during Halloween, taking authoritative levels to an all-time high,” Green said. “With this massive influx of authoritative enforcement, Isla Vista felt like a police-occupied state for many I.V. residents and afterwards, there were dozens of complaints of poor treatment by authority and many cases of civil rights abuses by authority.”</p>\n<p>Green said students organized to counter the increased presence of law enforcement with an overwhelming amount of monitoring done by citizens. Green put cameras into the hands of student volunteers to monitor Halloween in general, but also to monitor the police force. This civilian tactic worked to balance the huge numbers of law enforcement officials and keep them on their best behavior, Green said.</p>\n<p>“Recording kept law enforcement on its best behavior and it went very well, it was very peaceful and it greatly reduced the number of complaints against police behavior and unjust arrests,” Green said. “It worked as a friendly reminder to authority that we’re watching out for our community — it wasn’t an anti-cop thing, it was a way to respond to the overwhelming authority presence through being our own watching presence in the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Senior Deputy Mark Ward, who has worked as an I.V. Foot Patrol officer for the past 15 years, the increasing numbers of enforcement officials is necessary to protect I.V. during Halloween each year.</p>\n<p>“Halloween seems to get bigger and bigger every year,” Ward said. “Consequently, with increasing numbers of visitors, the law enforcement presence also has to increase. There has to be more law enforcement available to protect the growing number of people.”</p>\n<p>Ward said he noticed that in the last few years there has been a change in attitude towards law enforcement officers, and it has been “generally more assaultive.”</p>\n<p>“Years ago, back when I started as an officer, if you saw a law enforcement officer fighting somebody you would stop what you’re doing and help the officer,” Ward said. “On the other hand, nowadays, in that same situation, everyone or witness now take out their devices to video what’s going on.”</p>\n<p>However, Green said that video recording is a part of officer-to-citizen accountability.</p>\n<p>“The advantage generally goes to law enforcement when there are stationary cameras set up and police are largely given the benefit of the doubt in cases,” Green said.</p>\n<p>According to Ward, there has been a “fundamental change” in behavioral issues in I.V. — particularly in how college-age students react to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“When I started as an officer in I.V. you could walk up to a person or group and ask ‘What’s going on?’ and they would answer and be respectful,” Ward said. “Now with a simple ‘How are you doing?’ instead of receiving an answer, the group or person in question starts videotaping and chooses to escalate the encounter into a fight and it’s a waste of time, it’s dangerous and it puts everyone at risk.”</p>\n<p>According to Green, the level of police presence in Isla Vista will “probably continue” as the norm until I.V. has more say in its own governance.</p><div

Illegal plants were found in 18 different locations, primarily in national parks such as the Los Padres National Forest. Sheriffs</p>\n<p>also located campsites nearby the grow sites, however, no arrests were made during the eradication.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s spokesperson Kelly Hoover, this year’s raids yielded slightly less plants than last year but was “still a success.”</p>\n<p>“We had great collaboration with aviation, narcotic detectives and our partnering programs,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Hoover also said the Sherriff’s Office attributes reduction in eradication yield from California’s continuing water shortage.</p>\n<p>“The amount we eradicated this year was lower than previous seasons and probably due to the effects of the drought,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>First-year financial mathematics major Crystal Luo said the results are notable, but said she believes the numbers were not representative of all illegal marijuana sales.</p>\n<p>“[The results] are still miniscule in comparison to the underground marijuana industry as a whole. 47,000 plants is nothing when there are millions more and when each plant can even be harvested more than once,” Luo said. “I was not even aware that this eradication happened which shows how insignificant it was to me.”</p>\n<p>Luo said she does not believe the eradication’s results are worth the consequent campaign expenses.</p>\n<p>“The marijuana industry is too big to be affected by these small time eradications,” Luo said. “[You] might as well make marijuana legal to tax it and make billions.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history and statistics major Steven Tragarz said he does not see a lasting impression from this eradication process.</p>\n<p>“I do not believe the costs that went into the bust was worth it; they poured millions of dollars into a short-term, stop gap solution, which effects will soon be reversed,” Tragarz said. “In short, the cops may have won the battle, but they are still losing the war.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_57527\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"621833262\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57522\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57527\" data-attachment-id=\"57527\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/sheriffs-department-destroys-marijuana-plants/unnamed1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?fit=1001%2C751&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1001,751\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57527\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?resize=650%2C488\" alt=\"unnamed1\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?w=1001&amp;ssl=1 1001w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illegal growers may camp in National Forest land for extended periods of time, leading to large piles of garbage, human waste and the dumping of unregulated pesticides.<em> Photo courtesy of Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
