More easily forgotten by the hordes of transient students departing UCSB after a few years are the names, faces and duties of the hundreds of administrators who log their hours on campus for the sake of the university’s academic mission.</p>\n<p>That’s right — considering that most students only spend four years here, five tops — undergraduates are really just little fish in a large sea.</p>\n<p>What follows is a spotlight of the biggest fish on campus. Pay attention — most of these school officials have been working here since before the 2011 graduating class was born.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26799\" style=\"width: 191px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2050692356\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26799\" data-attachment-id=\"26799\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/yang/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"13\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS-1D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1129889590\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"yang\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"yang\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26799\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-26799\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Henry T. Yang</p></div></span><strong>Henry T. Yang</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A former dean of engineering and distinguished professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University, Chancellor Henry T. Yang is — quite literally — a rocket scientist.</p>\n<p>Since joining UCSB in 1994 as both chancellor and a professor of mechanical engineering, Yang has seen the university weather a heavy storm. While economic recession has made marks worldwide, its effects have been particularly brutal on state education.</p>\n<p>Despite substantial efforts to combat the devastating budget cuts, Yang said the end of the UC’s fiscal maelstrom is nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p>“Our challenge this year is to sustain the remarkable momentum of our progress while continuing to absorb the state budget cuts,” Yang said in an e-mail. “Despite these budget challenges, we remain absolutely unwavering in our commitment to providing our students with the quality education they deserve. After all, our students are the reason we are here.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, one of his most challenging tasks is communicating effectively with groups such as the UC Office of the President, alumni, donors, community members and representatives in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., to make sure that his decisions are well-informed and well-received.</p>\n<p>“It is important for all voices to be heard so that each person becomes a true partner in the process,” Yang said. “I think that’s what makes UC Santa Barbara so special — we are not just a university, we are also a community.”</p>\n<p>Yang is also well-known for demonstrating his commitment to the heart of the university: its student body. While some high-level administrators struggle to schedule time to spend with their student body, Yang said he thrives on it.</p>\n<p>“My wife, Dilling, and I are privileged to live on campus, near our residence halls and dining commons,” he said. “One of the most enjoyable parts of our daily campus life is getting to know our students — sharing dinner at the dining commons, cheering at student performances and athletic events, talking with students during our regular walks around campus and Isla Vista and working with our students on campus issues.”</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26804\" style=\"width: 191px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"903102166\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26804\" data-attachment-id=\"26804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/gene-lucas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"gene lucas\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Glenn (Gene) Lucas&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"gene lucas\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26804\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-26804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Glenn (Gene) Lucas</p></div></span><strong>Glenn (“Gene”) Lucas</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Executive Vice Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A UCSB alumnus himself, Gene Lucas went on to earn a Sc.D. degree at MIT before returning to UCSB in 1978 to teach at the College of Engineering. In addition to acting as Executive Vice Chancellor, Lucas has also worked as a professor of mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and materials.</p>\n<p>As EVC, Lucas is UCSB’s chief academic officer. His responsibilities — in consultation with the Santa Barbara Division of the Academic Senate — include overseeing academic planning and programming, developing and implementing academic policy as well as monitoring the academic personnel process. The Office of the EVC oversees all academic entities, including on and off-campus instructional units and instructional support programs.</p>\n<p>Lucas said he hopes to keep the university stable on its current track toward academic success and campus growth.</p>\n<p>“I want to see [UCSB] continue to grow in distinction and diversity,” Lucas said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>While planning the university’s future remains a bright spot on his to-do list, Lucas said his job also requires him to handle some somber aspects of public education.</p>\n<p>“Cutting budgets, laying people off, freezing hiring have all been difficult,” Lucas said. “Laying people off is the hardest because of the hardship this places on people that have been loyal contributors to UC Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2083610250\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/marc_fisher_08_30_07/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"marc_fisher_08_30_07\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Marc Fisher&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/marc_fisher_08_30_07-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"marc_fisher_08_30_07\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-26801\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></span><strong>Marc Fisher</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Senior Associate Vice Chancellor, Administrative Services &amp; Campus Architect</strong></p>\n<p>Today, UCSB is globally acclaimed as one of the most beautiful settings to attend college, but the campus actually used to be a ramshackle collection of WWII-era military installments when it was started. In between then and now, the credit for the striking physical appearance of today’s university goes to the likes of Marc Fisher and his predecessors.</p>\n<p>Fisher oversees Design and Construction Services, Campus Planning and Design, Housing and Residential Services and Physical Facilities, just to name a few. As a licensed architect with a Master’s degree in the field, Fisher is the man with the plan — actually, quite a few of them. Over the last eight years, he and his colleagues have developed the 2010 Long Range Development Plan, Campus Plan, Campus Housing Study, Campus Sustainability Plan and Physical Design Framework.</p>\n<p>Fisher said he looks forward to seeing the extensive work turn into tangible — not to mention environmentally-friendly — results.</p>\n<p>“This is an exciting time for our campus,” Fisher said in an e-mail. “It will be a campus that takes full advantage of our physical setting, is rich in texture and yet orderly in form, with many new housing options for our students, faculty and staff. It will be a campus that relies more heavily upon bicycle and pedestrian circulation and will continue to push into new areas of sustainability.”</p>\n<p>In addition to allowing him to utilize his passion for architecture, Fisher said his role at the university has given him the opportunity to join a tight-knit community.</p>\n<p>“My job entails so much variety — it is truly never dull,” he said. “I get to work with great people and have direct access to a cross section of our campus community — students, faculty and staff — as well as our local community.  Along with all of that, we are building and serving a campus environment commensurate with the academic excellence of this university.”</p>\n<p><span></span><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1634231109\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26800\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/young/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"young\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Michael Young&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"young\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-26800\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><strong>Michael Young</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs</strong></p>\n<p>As UCSB students, we know that a university is defined by more than what goes on inside its classrooms. It would be safe to say that Michael Young is responsible for almost everything else.</p>\n<p>As the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Young oversees more than 20 departments, including admissions, counseling, Student Health and the MultiCultural Center. After 20 years on the job, Young said his favorite part has always been — and will continue to be — his connection with the student body.</p>\n<p>“I know this will sound corny, but I really love working with UCSB students,” Young said. “I feel that I lucked out and ended up in a great career, in a great place for students. I’ve also had some extraordinary colleagues here in Santa Barbara and it’s been an absolute joy working with these professionals, trying to do our best to serve students here.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, the opportunity to develop a strong relationship with the student body is a double-edged sword.</p>\n<p>“At times in my job, I have a responsibility for either life-or-death matters relative to students or I have to become involved in situations where the academic careers of certain students are at risk,” Young said. “I’ve found that, even after all these years — and I’m glad of this — it has not come easy. It’s pretty sobering. Every time I am engaged in one of those situations, I am reminded that each and every student is an individual with a life and with a family, with dreams and hopes.”</p>\n<p>Although the Division of Student Affairs has been suffering at least $1 million of cutbacks a year for the past seven consecutive years, Young said he is determined to shield students from the repercussions.</p>\n<p>“[My goal] is to find out the impacts and the implications of the budget situation and then respond to that so that we can find ways to live within our new financial realities and continue to provide high-quality services to students,” Young said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/","id":3498,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3497,3496,3495],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yes Men to Visit UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":" Writer and Managing Editor Lexi Pandell interviews political satire group \"Yes Men\" on their recent activities and future plans.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Daily Nexus: First of all, thank you for taking the time to speak with me.</p>\n<p>No problem.

Pictured above, they travel the world in an effort to expose harsh truths to the unsuspecting public, often putting themselves in the midst of political turmoil, and impersonate officials like Jude Finisterra, a Dow Chemical Spokesperson, live on BBC News.</p></div></span>DN: You and Andy Bichlbaum have successfully impersonated officials from a number of high-profile companies, ranging from McDonald’s to Dow Chemical Company. How exactly do you pick your targets?</p>\n<p>How do we pick our targets? Good question. Well, it differs. Sometimes it’s just a matter of it being the biggest and the baddest. So, it’s really obvious. We did target ExxonMobil — and they’re both the biggest and the baddest, so it was easy. They have the largest profits for about five years running of any corporation. So, you know, in many ways, in that way, they were behind a lot of the sort of anti-climate activist campaigns and, basically, they were funding a lot of the climate change denial. They’ve stopped a lot of that now after it came out, but there were obvious reasons for targeting them.</p>\n<p>Increasingly over the years, we’ve worked with organizations who have been working on an issue for a long time and they say, “Hey, can you help us by targeting, for example, Dow Chemical because they haven’t cleaned up the mess in Bhopal and we don’t want it to become a precedent that, since they bought Union Carbide and then tried to wash their hands of it.”</p>\n<p>DN: Do you consider what you do to be “high-profile pranks” or is there another term that you prefer?</p>\n<p>We usually call them “actions.” They’re always intended to have political impact. We say “actions” because they’re events or spectacles. … The problem with “pranks” is that it often makes one think that they’re basically meant to be silly. … The other thing about pranks is that they’re often targeted at friends. When somebody describes a prank, they’re often thinking about Ashton Kutcher’s “Punk’d” or friends playing tricks on each other or the practical joke. So, we do, when we can, stay away from the word for that reason. We do think of what we do as having serious intent regardless of how funny or strange it is.</p>\n<p>DN: In your opinion, what are some of the most notable actions that the Yes Men have taken to date?</p>\n<p>Let’s see, probably one of the best publicized was when we printed an entire fake edition of the New York Times and we distributed 100,000 copies on the streets of New York along with volunteers from our mailing list. It was a New York Times that was full of good news, basically a lot of hopeful news. It came out about a week after Obama was elected and the message of it all was to keep pushing people to keep pushing after the election, not to just stop. Which, unfortunately, is in some ways what’s come to pass.</p>\n<p>So, that was pretty notable. But, last year, we impersonated the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is the largest lobbying organization in the world, and we announced that they were changing their position on climate change. And that resulted in not only a huge amount of media attention, but a lawsuit. We’re currently facing that suit and we think that that was widely successful. Not only because we’re being sued, but because them suing us indicates that maybe we’re attacking them where it counts.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”Photo Courtesy of www.yesmenfixtheworld.com” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1923122465\" data-slb-group=\"26698\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26701\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/5_bbc_dow_announcement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg?fit=1132%2C755&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1132,755\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"5_BBC_DOW_Announcement\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"\" title=\"5_BBC_DOW_Announcement\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26701\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>DN: Can you tell me more about the lawsuit that the Chamber of Commerce has pressed and if there are any updates on that situation?</p>\n<p>They are still suing us. There’s not really much going on with it. Right now, there’s been a motion to dismiss by our lawyers…and the judge is reviewing it, and has been for many months. We don’t know exactly when we’ll hear the next thing, but that’s where we’re at right now. Of course, if the judge doesn’t dismiss it and the Chamber continues to press it, then eventually we could end up in court.</p>\n<p>I think that, overall though, the Chamber’s claims are totally ludicrous. I think if we end up in court, they’ll have a lot more to answer for then we do. Because they spend almost half a million dollars every day lobbying, not to mention what they do during elections. Now that there’s no limits on what third parties can spend, the Chambers running tons of advertising for candidates who are super duper business friendly and are basically all Republican candidates.</p>\n<p>DN: So, essentially, are they accusing the Yes Men as a whole of committing fraudulent activities?</p>\n<p>…If you look at the lawsuit, which you can on the [Electronic Frontier Foundation] Web site [www.eff.org], what they’re actually claiming is that we were doing things, basically, as a form of advertising and that we’re trying to make money off of their trademark. I think it’s a really funny assumption that we were in a press conference where we impersonated them, we made direct political statements and then, afterward, our follow-up press releases were all about the content and the issues. It’s hard to understand how they think that we can make a business out of that or make money out of that somehow. It’s a misunderstanding that makes sense for people who only think of business. All they think is that the only reason for existence is making money.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”Photo Courtesy of www.theyesmenfixtheworld.com” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1331337717\" data-slb-group=\"26698\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26700\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/1_dead_man_float/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"1_Dead_Man_Float\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"1_Dead_Man_Float\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26700\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>DN: Now that you’ve achieved a certain level of fame both from the films and the Chamber lawsuit, do you think you and Andy will start to encounter any issues trying to pose as top officials or spokesmen?</p>\n<p>We don’t really know. We haven’t experienced any massive problems yet. There have been a few events where people have recognized us, usually they’re just a few people in the audience, and they don’t say anything to the conference organizers right then and there because they want to see what’s going to happen.</p>\n<p>DN: On your Web site there’s a page called the “Fix the World Challenge.” Can you tell me more about that and how the Yes Men are encouraging individuals to become more politically involved?</p>\n<p>Well, the “Fix the World Challenge” was an attempt to create a sort of social network game where people would contribute and discuss their own political pranks and their own creative activist actions…Right now, we’re focusing more on what we call the “Yes Lab,” which is a way for us to help organizations do more projects themselves. There’s a series of workshops that we offer for organizations that have an idea for a project and those that simply want to brainstorm a project and learn all of our tricks. So, that’s kind of where we are right now, but the idea is to kind of spread the joy and make it possible for all kinds of groups to leverage some of the techniques we’ve developed over the years for their own purposes.</p>\n<p>DN: In conclusion, tell me about what you have planned for the Oct. 15 event at UCSB?</p>\n<p>Yeah, well, I mean our plans are to come and talk to people about what we do, what we’ve been doing. We’ll show a show and tell. We’ll show some of the things we have and maybe we’ll lead the audience in a little brain storming session. That’s it, we don’t have any special tricks up our sleeve for Santa Barbara, but we may if it seems like it’s what the audience wants. We will be showing video clips that nobody’s seen before, at least no human[s] other than the Yes Men.</p>\n<p>We’ll be there to answer questions or, if you prefer, we can give you rotten fruit and vegetables to throw at us. But that has to be arranged in advance. So make sure to e-mail us so we can bring some.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/","id":3499,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3498,3497,3496],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Who’s Who in the County","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Whether you are a first year student or fifth year veteran, it is essential to recognize the movers and shakers within the county.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Whether you are a first year student or fifth year veteran, it is essential to recognize the movers and shakers within the county.

In Winter Quarter, two students overdosed on heroin and nearly died.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen a year like that,” I.V. Foot Patrol Lt. Olmstead said of the drug and alcohol related deaths in the 2008-09 school year. “They were normal, everyday, good people who made a mistake.”</p>\n<p>Last spring, 1,000 UCSB students took a survey responding to questions about using intoxicants. According to the study, 79.4 percent had consumed alcohol in the past month. 13.5 percent had tried cocaine, 20.6 percent had used prescription drugs that they were not prescribed and 2.5 percent had tried opiates.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students are happy with the party scene,” Olmstead said. “Students need to recognize that there is a problem.”</p>\n<p><strong>“You think it’s never going to happen to you.”</strong></p>\n<p>Just a week from graduating in 2009, Noah Krom headed downtown to celebrate with friends.

But they’re not aware of the long-term risks.”</p>\n<p><strong>“It was a fluke thing and a perfect storm.”</strong></p>\n<p>While there has been a visible increase in the use of prescription medications on campus, Kurta noted that one of the most dangerous trends has been a rise in opiate use.

Opiate receptors are in the brain as part of the pleasure center,” he said.</p>\n<p>In addition to being highly addictive, heroin is easy to overdose on due to the varying potency of different batches, especially when combined with other drugs.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>What’s next?</strong></p>\n<p>According to Associate Dean of Students Deborah Fleming, the university took action after last year’s deaths in part by establishing the “Just Call” campaign, which encourages students to call for help if their friends show signs of distress while partying.</p>\n<p>The C.A.S.E. Program has also adapted some of its material to fit changing needs and the Drug and Alcohol program has established more offices in Embarcadero Hall. The I.V. Foot Patrol installed a prescription drug “drop-off” box where expired or unused drugs can be dropped off anonymously and disposed of environmentally.</p>\n<p>Despite community efforts to prevent future tragedies, Rob Briner said that much more needs to be done.</p>\n<p>“What’s happening in I.V. is unacceptable and until we all stand tall … Nothing substantial will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Health Educator Michael Takahara said that a contributing factor to the extreme party culture in I.V. is the social norms theory — the perception that “everyone else is doing it.”</p>\n<p>The National Collegiate Health Assessment showed a huge discrepancy between the number of UCSB students who actually engage in habitual drug experimentation and the perceptions of student use.</p>\n<p>“[When] perceptions are wrong and exaggerated, people will be influenced by their false perceptions, not facts. Therefore, one strategy is to clear up misperceptions with actual use so people will not be falsely influenced,” Takahara said.</p>\n<p>Sara’s friend Taylor Suiter, who now serves as a Students Teaching Alcohol and Drug Responsibility intern, said friends also need to take responsibility for each other.</p>\n<p>“If I have a friend who appears to be in distress, I have no problem picking up the phone,” Suiter said. “I’d rather have a friend in trouble than a friend who’s dead.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Fleming expressed a need for more property owners and local alcohol retailers to interact with students responsibly.</p>\n<p>“Who’s benefiting from all of this partying and alcohol use? There’s a whole industry downtown,” she said. “Property owners on Del Playa get very high rent. There are lots of people in one unit and there’s a wink-wink nod-nod about partying in the apartment about damages. Shouldn’t property owners take more responsibility for what goes on on their properties?”</p>\n<p>Beth Krom, Noah’s mother, said a strong effort on all fronts is the only real way to prevent future fatalities in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Only through the concerted efforts of all stakeholders — the university, public policy leaders, public safety and those who profit by the student population such as property owners and those who run the bars and restaurants students patronize — can a positive change in the UCSB/Isla Vista culture be advanced,” she said in an e-mail. </p>\n<p>John Piacentini said he hopes students learn from last year’s tragedies.</p>\n<p>“You really need to be careful and you really need to know your limits and you really need to be aware of the people around you,” he said. “There’s nothing that you can imagine like losing a son or a brother or a best friend.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22586\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22586\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/","id":1284,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[1283,1282,1281],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Forty years ago, a mob of students stormed the Bank of America building.","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the night of Feb. 25, 1970, second-year student Greg Desilet grabbed his camera from his apartment on El Nido Lane and joined the crowds swarming the streets of Isla Vista.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On the night of Feb. 25, 1970, second-year student Greg Desilet grabbed his camera from his apartment on El Nido Lane and joined the crowds swarming the streets of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>After a year of high tension, unrest and anger, rioting students had looted and set fire to the local Bank of America, which stood on the site of today’s Embarcadero Hall.</p>\n<p>“It was quite an extraordinary scene that night,” Desilet said. “People were in all kinds of different moods — happy, celebrating, freaked out, others shocked, stunned by what was going on.

As a group of students walked back toward Isla Vista after the speech, police beat 22-year-old student Rich Underwood into submission and arrested him for carrying a bottle of wine they assumed was a Molotov cocktail.</p>\n<p>“Imagine being in Harder Stadium and having the lawyer of a high-profile national trial … draw connections between what has been happening nationally with what has been happening on campus,” then-Santa Barbara City College student and KCSB broadcaster Malcolm Gault-Williams said. “And then imagine a large part of those attendees leave the stadium and … watch as police not just arrest a student but beat the shit out of him.”</p>\n<p>According to John Riley, a second-year student living on Del Playa Drive at the time, the police’s actions fueled student anger.</p>\n<p>“Cops arrested this guy and set everything off,” Riley said. “It was like throwing a match into a gasoline can, everybody just went nuts.”</p>\n<p>Later that night, the bank was looted and set on fire on two separate occasions — once between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. when a dumpster was lit on fire and once around midnight when gasoline was used to rekindle the blaze.</p>\n<p>According to Professor Emeritus Richard Flacks, a well-known liberal leader whose appointment to the Sociology Dept. in 1969 caused a stir among conservatives including then-Governor Ronald Reagan, the burning of the bank was not a premeditated event.</p>\n<p>“By evening I would guess hundreds of people were in the street and at some point people lit a trash dumpster and pushed it through the bank doors,” Flacks said. “I kind of never believed people thought that would happen.”</p>\n<p>Some students saw the bank as a symbol of big business, capitalism and the Vietnam War, citing its ties to the defense industry.</p>\n<p>“It was the biggest capitalist thing around,” Becca Wilson, a fourth-year student and then-editor in chief of El Gaucho, the predecessor to the Daily Nexus, said. “It was a symbol of the corporations that benefited from war and were oppressing people all over world, in whose interest government was acting.”</p>\n<p>Others maintain that the bank was burned purely out of anger and frustration with overwhelming police presence.</p>\n<p>“The day afterwards a lot of it was rationalized as anti-war,” Desilet said. “The bank was seen to be in league with defense corporations providing armaments for Vietnam. That was the rationale given, but in my view it was more. It was locally centered with a lot of local anger toward police that had developed over time.”</p>\n<p>“People were just pissed off. They were really pissed off”</p>\n<p>The 1969-70 year was tumultuous in the school’s history, with tension on campus growing alongside national unrest and disagreement over the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>The voting age in 1970 was 21, but after the lottery system was instituted for the draft, many younger students received numbers that increased their chances of deployment after graduation.</p>\n<p>Wilson said that the draft was what really brought the reality of the war home to students.</p>\n<p>“When I started in fall of 1966, there were literally a handful of people demonstrating, just a quiet little vigil in front of the library,” she said. “Three years later it was a widespread movement where probably most students were against the war. By that time, students started to be drafted. It changed the whole atmosphere, became much more personal.”</p>\n<p>The charged political climate of the time was evident well beyond the confines of Isla Vista, too.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine now, but the whole country was just boiling then, with the Chicago Seven, the war, people getting drafted … the whole country was pretty well out of control,” Riley said.</p>\n<p>According to Desilet, many of the students targeted their rage at the ever-present law enforcement officers patrolling Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Tensions were high in I.V. toward anything and anyone who represented enforcement of the status quo, and the most immediate and visible representatives of this status quo line of defense turned out to be police and narcotics agents,” Desilet said. “The accumulated rage of the disenfranchised and the waiting and unwilling recruits in line for Vietnam landed squarely on the county sheriff and his agents.”</p>\n<p>On top of this, the growing drug culture and hippie lifestyle of the time widened the generation gap between students and police, who patrolled Isla Vista and campus in riot gear, often using tear gas to disperse crowds.</p>\n<p>“There was nobody over 25, hardly, and this counter culture, drug culture climate, which meant police were unable to understand, or appreciate Isla Vista so to speak,” Flacks said. “[The police] really thought the students were bad guys and that they were at odds with students. And vice versa. Students knew if they were driving [a] Volkswagen van painted up or generally had long hair hippy attire you were going to be harassed by police, stopped in traffic, pulled over, etc.”</p>\n<p>Although many students were not embroiled in conflict with the police and demonstrations against the war, anger was the primary motivation for those who played a role in the burning of the bank.</p>\n<p>An Occupied Territory</p>\n<p>Once the smoke cleared on Feb. 26 — with the Bank of America building in ruins — Gov. Reagan declared a state of emergency.</p>\n<p>“[Isla Vista] was just dramatically changed,” Gault-Williams said. “Everybody was walking on eggshells. Some were happy, some angry … all kinds of moods. Everyone began to unite even more so after the bank burning in respect to police.”</p>\n<p>A curfew was instituted in Isla Vista and nearly 300 people were arrested and taken to the county jail.</p>\n<p>“Everybody sensed huge confrontation the night after,” Desilet explained. “I went out on street again to photograph in the early evening. When I was on Ocean Road taking pictures of police in the San Rafael parking lot … they arrested me and I was taken to their staging area. We were then bussed out to fire station down on Storke Road and eventually over to the new county jail, which was so new that they didn’t even have it open yet.”</p>\n<p>The National Guard and Los Angeles County SWAT teams were called in to help maintain order. Bank of America declared that it would not withdraw from Isla Vista and constructed a trailer as a makeshift bank, which quickly became the target of numerous demonstrations.</p>\n<p>On April 18, a rally was scheduled against the temporary bank. Associated Students President Bill James went on the radio to speak against further violence, urging students to protect the bank from vandalism.</p>\n<p>Police arrived in armored trucks, dressed in riot gear and armed with tear gas. Amid the confusion, 22-year-old UCSB student Kevin Moran was shot and killed.</p>\n<p>Although the police claimed the bullet originated from a sniper in the crowd, a ballistics test determined that it came from a policeman’s rifle. The incident was deemed an accident, and the officer was later exonerated.</p>\n<p>On June 3, 17 students were indicted for the bank burning, after supposedly being identified from photographs taken on Feb. 25.  The indictments were met with controversy, however, as several of the students had solid alibis.</p>\n<p>“What was obvious was that they were all well-known campus activist radical leaders,” Flacks said. “The idea that that particular group of well-known people were all together around that dumpster was outlandish. Especially since some of them were among those arrested the day before and were actually in jail when the bank burned.”</p>\n<p>“Social Change, Fair Play and Peace”</p>\n<p>The rallies, tear gas and arrests continued throughout the course of the year, and according to former students, fundamentally changed the face of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The riots destroyed the town,” Riley said. “Before the riots it was this cute little town, nice cinemas, new bookstores, more like a Santa Cruz or something, and after it was … burned out. It just destroyed the town.”</p>\n<p>Yet a new Isla Vista emerged from the smoldering ruins of the Bank of America.</p>\n<p>“It suddenly created a lot of attention on Isla Vista itself and how students were living and sparked the creation of many community organizations and grassroots movements that turned into institutions,” Wilson said.</p>\n<p>The Bank of America closed its Isla Vista branch in 1981, opting to open an ATM on Embarcadero del Norte instead. Embarcadero Hall stands in place of the bank today.

I won’t put it out there unless it’s the right situation.”</p>\n<p>On one occasion, though, Zavala did speak up and the reaction surprised him.</p>\n<p>“One guy came up to me after the class and thanked me for my service,” Zavala said. “I didn’t know what to say.”</p>\n<p>Tonight, Student Veterans at UCSB — which Zavala joined when he arrived at the campus — will be hosting its third Ask-A-Vet forum in the Student Resource Building Multipurpose Room at 7:30.</p>\n<p>“We’ll focus on the experiences of student veterans in the military, the transitional challenges and how it becomes our war from the military to the university,” Student Veteran Organization at UCSB President Quincy Yamada said.</p>\n<p>Every day, former active duty Marine Sgt. David Holmes noted, students go to class with military veterans without realizing the depth of their experiences.</p>\n<p>“The majority of vets volunteer because they want to serve the country. It’s a huge sacrifice to serve in deployments, the time you give up,” Holmes, a graduate student in education,  said. “Eighteen to twenty-two. Those are the prime years of your life, and you gave them to your country.”</p>\n<p><b>A Different Way to Study Abroad</b></p>\n<p>Quincy Yamada, a business economics major with accounting emphasis, enlisted in the Navy just after graduating high school. From his permanent duty station in Japan, he worked as an aircraft mechanic and spent over a year at sea during his four years of foreign service.</p>\n<p>For Justus Hanna, a combat engineer who worked in demolitions, his military service took him across Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan. Hanna, an economics and global studies major, kept a blog while on deployment, writing about some incidents he described as “so out of control, it’s hilarious.”</p>\n<p>In one entry, from June 6, 2005, Hanna detailed an ambush on a routine Traffic Control Point mission in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>“We charge across the road and start receiving fire towards our direction,” Hanna wrote. “Wanting to avoid any casualties on our side by having a face-to-face showdown with the guy, someone shouts ‘Who’s got a grenade?’ the LT responds like he just found a prize; ‘I got one’ and tosses it short of the hole! Someone else screams ‘FRAG OUT!! IT’S SHORT IT’S SHORT!!’ and we hit the dirt. Luckily it rolls into the hole and explodes, myself and everyone around me is on their feet charging the trench shooting through the cloud of dust at the enemy… which turned out to be one guy with a rifle!”</p>\n<p>What stands out for Zavala from his time in the Marines are the long days driving convoys across Kuwait and the friendships he made over the nearly eight years he served.</p>\n<p>“One of the great things that the military as an institution provides is that you make great friends from all walks of life,” Zavala said. “That’s one of the things that I miss most, my friends and the friends you make there.”</p>\n<p>Holmes founded SVO at UCSB in 2007 and is currently conducting research on student veterans in higher education. As a Marine, Holmes spent time in Greece and Japan and transferred to UCSB in 2005.</p>\n<p>“The transition can be quite difficult,” he said. “It’s like night and day. … I got here and felt very disconnected.”</p>\n<p><b>Combat to Classroom</b></p>\n<p>While visiting the campus on what he deemed a “recon trip,” Hanna said he appreciated the UCSB lifestyle and the introduction to SVO at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“After I got accepted, I got an email from Quincy welcoming me,” Hanna noted. “Everyone seemed to have an outpouring of support and I was totally ecstatic.”</p>\n<p>Holmes said one of the major reasons he started SVO at UCSB was to provide a place for veterans to feel comfortable on campus.</p>\n<p>“Camaraderie is a big part of the group,” Holmes said. “It’s a support network; a way for people to find others with similar experiences. It’s hard to make friends with the 18-year-old sitting next to you in class.”</p>\n<p>For Holmes and other veterans, revealing their military service can often mean facing difficult situations.</p>\n<p>“The first thing people ask is, ‘Have you killed someone?'” Holmes said. “That’s not an appropriate question. There are guys here that have, and some may not want to talk about it.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Kirsten Gabriel, a psychologist in Counseling Services with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder training, said student veterans’ experiences and backgrounds can vary considerably.</p>\n<p>“They’re not traditional 18-22 students,” she said. “They’re already older. They weren’t just hanging out at home playing video games, they were out on deployment and part of a disciplined and structured environment. They’re coming to a university environment where things are much more fluid, where they don’t wear uniforms and there’s not a rigid time bound structure. … It’s a culture shock in many ways. You’re used to having a gun on you, and it’s a pretty disconcerting feeling not to anymore.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Gabriel, who worked for five years in a Baltimore VA medical center, said veterans face specific issues that other students can’t always understand.</p>\n<p>“In combat, some things once you see, you can’t unsee them,” Dr. Gabriel said. “It can start to become the crisis of, ‘What is the meaning of what I just did over there and the sacrifices people made?’ It can be distressing to people to make sense of what they had done.”</p>\n<p>For many veterans on campus, the student organization offers a way to integrate into the college community.</p>\n<p>“I feel so old sometimes,” Hanna said. “That’s another factor for reintegrating as a vet: As a guy like me, married, 27, I can’t integrate with a lot of the activities here. As a continuing and transfer student, you’re really a fish out of water.”</p>\n<p>While his time in the service was defining, Yamada said, it also means his college experience is tinged with something his peers often don’t share.</p>\n<p>“It feels like I put my life on hold,” he said. “In hindsight, I’m catching up.”</p>\n<p><b>Making the Grade</b></p>\n<p>Along with SVO at UCSB, staff and administrators are currently pushing for a more veteran-friendly campus, particularly through the Veterans Resource Team. The interdisciplinary team aims to offer training for faculty and staff and develop a network of mentors for incoming veterans; last quarter, a member of the VRT, Women’s Center Program Director Jess O’Keefe, also started teaching a class specifically for veterans.</p>\n<p>“The long-range goal is that all students feel comfortable and have resources they need to be successful at UCSB,” Dr. Gabriel said. “They have particular issues and have served their country in ways we have not. We need to honor them and help them be successful.”</p>\n<p>According to Doug Bradley, a lecturer in the Writing Program and a military veteran himself, it is important to remember that dealing with veterans is not a one-size-fits-all deal.</p>\n<p>“Contrary to popular misconceptions, not all returning veterans are quivering bowls of PTSD Jell-O, waiting to emotionally collapse or go berserk,” Bradley wrote in an e-mail. “In fact, most vets are tired of that stereotype. … For that reason, it’s usually best to let veterans talk about their war experiences if and when they are ready. For many of them, that will be never. Students and faculty need to be patient and let vets adapt to civilian life on their own time.”</p>\n<p>Bradley said his homecoming after serving in the Gulf War was vastly different from what many recently discharged soldiers experience.</p>\n<p>“I had orders to remain in theater for eighteen months, but we came home in six,” Bradley wrote. “Can you believe that?! Six months. Compare that with our current veterans, many of whom are coming off their third or fourth tour of duty. … Vets now are coming home to a much quieter, more ambivalent America. The war has stretched on and on, and Americans –while ever loyal and proud of their vets — are having a much harder time figuring out what these two wars mean. Our vets feel the full brunt of that ambivalence as they search for meaning in their own experiences.

We bought a tandem bicycle when we came to California. … Our lives were welded together on the tandem.”</p>\n<p>While John teaches various sociology courses, Janice focuses solely on the pair’s classes on human sexuality.</p>\n<p>“I’m just hired for sex,” Janice joked.</p>\n<p>“You sound like a sex worker,” John teased.</p>\n<p>The pair moved from randy to affectionate as Janice listed the numerous reasons she loves her husband, naming kindness, intelligence, sincerity and dedication, among others.</p>\n<p>“His cute little face,” she said. “He makes so many funny faces, you’d be amazed. … He’s a lot of fun. He’s dedicated to making our life as good as it can be together. And he fits in some cute little jeans.”</p>\n<p>“Superficial Janice,” James said in jest.</p>\n<p>James also expressed admiration for his significant other.</p>\n<p>“She creates so many wonderful moments for us,” he said. “Our life is charmed.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, the pair stressed their dedication to physical fitness. John and Janice, 69 years old and 64 years old, respectively, hike regularly and are able to trek 3,200 ft. in one hour and 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>John also said that intimacy is crucial to a healthy relationship and taking frequent mini-vacations allow the pair to spend much-needed personal time with one another.</p>\n<p>“We spend a lot of time being intimate with each other so these vacations are very special,” he said. “We like the intimacy that comes from sitting and talking about plans; where to go next.”</p>\n<p><b>The Twins</b></p>\n<p>Charles and Dolly Mullin, both communication professors, have distinctive teaching methodologies, but are surprisingly alike in their personalities — a fit that makes the couple like two peas in a pod.</p>\n<p>The pair first realized the likeness as undergraduates at UCLA when pulling all-nighters to watch David Letterman and discuss Scottish music. According to Dolly, the two never tried to look their best during those long nights, which allowed them to fall in love with each other’s personalities instead of focusing on physical appearance.</p>\n<p>“It was certainly comfort and familiarity at first sight,” Charles said. “It was a perfect fit right away.”</p>\n<p>According to Charles, the two eventually decided to attend UCSB for graduate school, where they stayed to teach asfaculty lecturers.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to get your Ph.D someplace and stay at that institution to teach,” he said. “We had more or less committed emotionally and spiritually to staying at UCSB, which may have factored into our decision to not go into a tenure track elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>Aside from admiring his intelligence and strong sense of principle, Dolly said she trusts her partner completely.</p>\n<p>“We think the same way on so many issues,” she said. “I trust his judgment on just about everything.”</p>\n<p>Charles, on the other hand, said he is thankful for Dolly’s selflessness.</p>\n<p>“You take care of me, which I appreciate,” he said. “You look after the things I don’t like to do for myself, like taxes and stuff. We both do stuff that the other person doesn’t want to.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the Mullins, the communication department, which has been dubbed Noah’s Ark, also houses four other couples.</p>\n<p>Although some married couples prefer to keep their professional lives separate from their personal ones, Dolly said working together can be beneficial.</p>\n<p>“We know each other’s stresses,” she said. “It’s hard [when you have] different jobs and don’t know why the other is worried.”</p>\n<p>Aside from working, living and volunteering together, the pair also commutes from Santa Ynez — a 50-minute drive — together. Charles joked that he forced Dolly to adopt a rural lifestyle.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if you marry a person who’s optimal for you,” he said. “You marry them and mold them. … I sometimes like to say I dragged [Dolly] out there [to Santa Ynez].”</p>\n<p>“But I went willing,” Dolly said.</p>\n<p>“It’s like Green Acres,” Charles joked. “I’m Eddie Albert.”</p>\n<p>“And I’m Eva Gabor,” Dolly said, as though reading her husband’s mind.</p>\n<p><b>The Honeymooners</b></p>\n<p>Although married for eight years, physics professor Tommaso Treu and history professor Stefania Tutino can easily be mistaken for newlyweds.</p>\n<p>Aside from holding hands, exchanging loving glances and kissing, the pair is also so bright-eyed when speaking about each other that an onlooker would suspect they were honeymooners.</p>\n<p> The couple first met over a decade ago when attending Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy. Their different academic callings, however, forced them to live apart during a portion of their relationship. The two finally reunited years later while pursuing post doctorate degrees at UCLA.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard for two academic people [to maintain a relationship],” Stefania said. “There’s a lot of work behind it.”</p>\n<p>Despite the hard work, Tommaso said he would do anything for the pair to stay together.</p>\n<p>“She’s the most interesting, intelligent person I’ve met,” Tommaso said. “You never get bored with Stefania.”</p>\n<p>Thankfully, UCSB is a very supportive institution for spouses, the couple said.</p>\n<p>“They understand that academics are married to academics,” Tommaso said. “It’s a wise thing for the institution. [They] don’t want professors to constantly leave [to go visit spouses].”</p>\n<p>Despite specializing in distinct disciplines, the professors teach a class together, Stefania said.</p>\n<p>“We do a lot of cross-collaborations,” she said. “We teach a class on the origins of cosmology from a physics- history-religious studies perspective.”</p>\n<p>Working alongside each other sometimes creates competition, she noted.</p>\n<p>“Academics are competitive in many ways,” Stefania said. “It’s actually a way to make each other better. It fosters each other’s potential.”</p>\n<p>Like their contrasting areas of study, Stefania said the duo’s personalities are complementary.</p>\n<p>“It’s easy to be in different fields,” she said. “The same would be too close to home. Being in different fields makes it healthy.”</p>\n<p>“Healthier,” Tommaso added.</p>\n<p>The couple also has affectionate names for one another. Tommaso calls Stefania “gentleman,” while she calls him “Mr. Bennet” when annoyed, referencing Pride and Prejudice.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Stefania said Tommaso has had an immeasurable impact on her life.</p>\n<p>“When you spend a third of your life with someone, it’s hard to remember the way it was before,” she said. “We’ve been there for each other for a long time, at the most critical stages. We see each other grow, influencing as we observe.”</p>\n<p>Tommaso also said he has learned a great deal from his wife.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot easier to ask what didn’t she teach me,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20236\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20236\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/","id":3543,"author":{"id":334,"name":"Maane Khatchatourian"},"related":[3542,3541,3540],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Campus Commemorates Veterans","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Honoring Memorial Day one day past, the Student Veterans at UCSB organized thousands of crosses and set them along the strips of lawn on campus Tuesday.

All around, 18 to 22-year-olds are making their way towards the ocean – specifically, toward Isla Vista’s notorious Del Playa Drive. Even a few blocks away from I.V.’s main drag, the faint buzz of speakers can be heard.</p>\n<p>But first, a cup of coffee. It’s the last Friday of summer for anyone attending Santa Barbara City College, and the sergeant and his accompanying officer know that tonight is going to be a long one.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista, UCSB’s crowded, pint-sized college town is often – and falsely – called the most densely populated neighborhood on the West Coast. Its reputation for debauchery, however, is much more quantifiable: With only approximately 10 percent of the county’s total population, I.V. accounts for roughly 20 percent of serious crimes committed – the vast majority of which are linked to alcohol use.</p>\n<p>According to Sgt. Raney, curbing the use of alcohol is at the heart of what the IVFP does.</p>\n<p>“If we can control the alcohol, we can help mitigate the serious crimes and accidents [so prominent in I.V.],” Raney says.</p>\n<p><b>Not-so-medical Marijuana</b></p>\n<p>The quick jerk of the man’s hand toward his back pocket immediately catches the attention of the patrolling officers. He might as well have just walked up and told the cops he was doing something illegal.</p>\n<p>It’s 10:55 p.m. and Sgt. Raney asks the man what he just put in his back pocket. Unfortunately for this second year SBCC student, playing dumb is not going to work. Sgt. Raney suspects it may be a bag of cocaine he stuffed into his pocket (an automatic arrest), so he places the man in handcuffs and asks him again, “What’s in your pocket?”</p>\n<p>Seeing that there is no way out, the man confesses, “A gram of marijuana.”</p>\n<p>The handcuffs are removed and he is told to sit on the curb. Sgt. Raney writes out the citation for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, a misdemeanor offense that’s going to cost the toker a little more than $100.</p>\n<p>Trying to make light of the situation, the young man tells the officers he doesn’t even have a pipe to smoke his recently purchased weed.</p>\n<p>“I just figured I’d pick that up later,” he says.</p>\n<p><b>A Captain’s Tale</b></p>\n<p>“I don’t think that’s legal,” yells a reveler socializing in front of a party on oceanside Del Playa Drive. “That’s private property!”</p>\n<p>The sheriff pays him no mind and continues down the side alley, making his way toward the balcony jutting precariously out over the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>“Even if it is private property, if it’s an open party or can be viewed from the street, we have the right to enter,” Sgt. Raney says as he passes onto the property.</p>\n<p>There, unaware of his imminent arrival, are five underage drinkers enjoying the sound of the waves and the comforting warmth of Captain Morgan’s Spiced Rum. There are not many places where college students have it so good, but with the pros come the cons.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take the officers long to determine that none of the revelers are of age. However, some insist on trying to talk their way out of it, swearing that the half-drunk beers that sit directly between their feet are not theirs.</p>\n<p>Caught red-handed, however, nobody is getting out of it. All five watch as their Minor in Possessions – the most common of citations according to Sgt. Raney – are written out and their booze is poured onto the ground.</p>\n<p>One, however, is adamant about talking his way out trouble, insisting he is a good guy and that he isn’t drunk at all. Sgt. Raney agrees he is no doubt a good guy, but keeps filling out the paperwork.</p>\n<p>With the yellow citation in hand – an approximate $150 ticket plus the cost of the drug awareness classes most opt for – the young man changes gears and tries to salvage what is left of the night.</p>\n<p>“If you were honestly cool cops, you’d let me drink that beer right now,” the 19-year-old says, referring to the nearly full forty of Miller Genuine Draft sitting at his feet. Without uttering a word, the accompanying officer picks up the beer and pours it out onto the cement.</p>\n<p><b>May I Recommend a Bush?</b></p>\n<p>There are a definite drawbacks to heavy drinking (a killer hangover, a bad decision or two, not remembering if you made a bad decision or two) but few are more prevalent – or urgent – than the need to urinate.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, you just can’t find that necessary toilet.</p>\n<p>If this is the case, a trip into one of Isla Vista’s many parks could be an (illegal) necessity, but pissing on the side of building in view of the street is never a good idea.</p>\n<p>It’s 12:50 a.m. and Sgt. Raney catches a glimpse of a man making just that mistake.</p>\n<p>Upon noticing the sheriff, he instinctively grabs his phone and makes like he was busy texting, only his phone is locked and the screen remains blank.</p>\n<p>The man is asked to sit on the curb, and while the officer is filling out the citation, a resident of the apartment comes out to vouch for the man.</p>\n<p>“He’s one of my very good friends,” she tells Sgt. Raney.</p>\n<p>“Did he have permission to pee on the side of your apartment?” Raney asks with a slight smile, but receives no answer.</p>\n<p>The man is cited for breaking a county ordinance, the lesser of two possible citations. Had he been especially rude, Raney says, he could have received the more severe penalty, which carries with it a fine of over $700.</p>\n<p><b>867-5309</b></p>\n<p>It’s 1:05 a.m. and the streets of Isla Vista are still crowded, albeit more intoxicated than a few hours earlier. Sgt. Raney and his fellow officer are standing in the shadows along Del Playa Drive, waiting for something to catch their attention.</p>\n<p>A young female, clearly intoxicated, stumbles by, holding on to a young man who doesn’t appear to be a good friend. Sgt. Raney stops the pair and asks to talk with the young lady.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney asks if she knows her male counterpart, and she tells him that they met tonight. Her accent tells him that she is not a native to Isla Vista, and he asks her where she is staying. The young Swedish woman points back and says, “the house with the dolphins on it.”</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney believes she is too drunk to take care of herself and, for her own safety, does not want to leave her with her newly acquired friend. He asks her if she has any other friends with her and she shakes her head, but offers to call them.</p>\n<p>The sheriff agrees, and she tries a few numbers without success, until finally reaching a friend. Sgt. Raney takes the phone from her, introduces himself and tells the young woman’s friend, “Come and get your friend, so she doesn’t go to jail.”</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, a gaggle of girls shows up and leads the young Swede away.</p>\n<p>“I was trying to protect an intoxicated woman strolling down the street with a random guy,” Raney says later. Had her friends not shown up, he says, he would have had to arrest her for public intoxication, which can have potentially serious ramifications and almost always includes a night in jail.</p>\n<p><b>Pending Sobriety</b></p>\n<p>The moon is sinking beneath the western horizon and the streets are starting to finally clear out. It’s nearly two in the morning and the fervor from hours past is starting to wane.</p>\n<p>Standing at the corner of DP and El Embarcadero, a number of the deputies congregate to discuss the night’s events, but none can help but notice when a highly intoxicated female stumbles out into the middle of street carrying her shoes in one hand and dropping her phone with the other.</p>\n<p>Two officers immediately make their way toward her, and watch as she attempts to pick up her phone, only to drop one of her shoes. The officers walk up to her and tell her to stop, but she brushes them off and continues walking, saying, “I’m not drinking.”</p>\n<p>One of the officers grabs her arm, and directs her to the curb. They ask her for her age and she tells them she’s 21. Her demeanor is combative, and she attempts to stand up, but is quickly reprimanded. She is asked her age again.</p>\n<p>“Twenty-four,” is her new answer. The deputy tells her she just gave two separate answers and she says, “I’m 23.”</p>\n<p>The officers stand her up and slap handcuffs on her. She continues to tell them that she’s not drunk, but her appeals fall on deaf ears. The deputies arrest her for being drunk in public.</p>\n<p>(An easy way to avoid this fate is to always walk with someone and never give the police a reason to stop you. Stumbling down the street and repeatedly dropping your belongings are dead giveaways.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the young lady acted unwisely and has to pay the consequences. After a few moments, a patrol car picks her up and transports her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she is housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/","id":3571,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3570,3569,3568],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Trail Needs Dusting: A Nexus Goodbye","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I've learned a lot of things in the past four years and many of them I learned while working at one of the best damned college papers in the state.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I’ve learned a lot of things in the past four years and many of them I learned while working at one of the best damned college papers in the state. So, rather than boring you with my philosophies on life and journalism, I’ve decided to share with you all at least a few of those things:</p>\n<p>1) Parents of incoming freshmen are really, really nervous. Oh, and sex columns scare the crap out of them.<br>\n2) Albino raccoons are invading Isla Vista. When good ol’ Albert Raccoon bit the dust last year, we thought we had seen the last of El Blanco, but we were wrong. Dead wrong. Okay, not dead wrong. At any rate, I’m taking credit for naming the celebrated I.V. mascot since I dubbed him Albert in our April Fool’s issue many moons ago. Deal with it, Facebook.<br>\n3) Associated Students elections are fierce and scary. Sometimes when I log on GOLD at night, I can still hear the screaming…<br>\n4) The Daily Nexus is the best place to work on campus.</p>\n<p>We’ve had quite the year, gang. The Daily Nexus got a front-page makeover, feature stories and a science page; our Web site got ads, videos and comment boards; UCTV made a documentary about us; we had some amazing news coverage – hello, does Hillary Clinton ring a bell? – and we took home several awards, including the honor of being named one of the top three college newspapers in the state. Oh yeah, and we stopped two subpoenas. How about them apples?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nevertheless, I owe it to you, my amazing staff, who have suffered through some late nights, some intense stories, and above all else, my non sequiturs. I could not have done it without you. Additionally, I could not have done it without the awesome training of former editors Kaitlin Pike and Jason La.</p>\n<p>So without further delay, here is a list of my immense thanks to you all:</p>\n<p>Dianne Jobson: You have been everything I could have hoped for and more. You are the glue that holds the Nexus together. I know everyone in the office loves you, but I love you more. It’ll be weird not to work together anymore, but I’m glad that we’ll still be very close next year. I look forward to our next adventure.</p>\n<p>Sabrina Ricci: Dammit, kid, get a watch! Oh, who am I kidding. I can’t stay mad at you. You’ve done some great work with the layout this year and, holy cow, you revived the science section! Kudos, my friend.</p>\n<p>Lauren Crecelius: You are one of the most reliable people in the office. It’s been a relief to have you on the team. You are not only a fantastic editor, but a true friend.</p>\n<p>Travis Miller and Evan Wagstaff: T-Mills, you’ll always be in my heart and on my desktop, and Evan, you have a beautiful voice. Both of you have really pulled through this year and I thank you kindly. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Aria Miran: I can’t believe you are hanging around I.V. for another year. I’m warning freshmen parents about you. Seriously, though, you have led your news desk to glory this year and we’ve had some awesome times together. I have no regrets.</p>\n<p>Jessica Mullen and Mackenzie Weinger: You write some amazing and well-researched stories and it’s always fun to watch you get excited. I am so very proud of you two and I will miss you both. Give ’em hell.</p>\n<p>Erin Currie: I thought we fired you! Ok, ok. You can keep your job. Erin, I think it’s fair to say that you are one of the nicest and most humble persons in this office. Please, don’t change!</p>\n<p>Patty Bobek and C.K. Hickey : You always come into work with a smile on your faces and you’ve handled some difficult situations with the opinion page this past year. Patty, you’ve truly encouraged me to always do more and, C.K., I suspect you are Superman, but I guess I’ll never know … I put Kryptonite in your hookah.</p>\n<p>Chris Hoffman and Alex Pavlovic: If there’s anything I’ll remember, it’s Chris’s mischievous grin and Alex’s sly-guy wit. You have rocked the world of sports this year and your columns kick ass. Call me when you make it to ESPN.</p>\n<p>Mollie Vandor and Tyler Vickers: The woman who takes shit from no one and the nicest guy in the office. You two are truly a force to be reckoned with. You guys know what you want and you take it.</p>\n<p>Erin Saldana and Rickey Mizuno: Where’s Erin? I can’t find Erin? Oh, there she is. As our pint-sized photographer you took some beautiful shots this year, and Rickey, you were always there for us when we needed you. You also make a damn fine drink. With that, I leave you with Erin’s favorite word: Chupacabra.</p>\n<p>Simon Estrada and Rick Martinez: You are so damned talented. Every time I find a piece of art I like in the paper, it usually tends to be yours, and I like the way you push your artists to excel. I see great things in your future.</p>\n<p>Valerie Tidwell, Melissa Davis, Noel Woodward, Rachel Lorencz, Virginia Yapp, and the rest of Copy: I regret that I do not have enough space to give thanks to each and every one of you. Please know that your willingness to endure some of those late nights has always left me in awe of you all.</p>\n<p>Kelly O’Halloran and Kera Zacuto: You guys made On the Menu the best section it could possibly be. Never has this section looked so beautiful. I thank you very much for you hard work.</p>\n<p>Nicki Arnold: You are too cool and I was lucky to have you by my side when I was opinion editor. I’m so glad you came back this year. You are the little sister I always wish I had.</p>\n<p>Nikki Moore, Craig Calkins and Dana Olsen: You guys may have left your desks a little early, but you never left my mind. It’s been fun growing up with you at the Nexus and I hope to run into you again post-graduation.</p>\n<p>Dan Gruen, Ryan Moll, Steve Placial: Video guys! You have helped make our vision a reality. You have formed the basis of what will likely become an integral part of the Web site. Thank you so much!</p>\n<p>Barb MacLean and J.E. Anderson: You have been my guiding lights over the past four years and you have contributed to this paper far more than you can imagine. You two are the hardest-working people we have.</p>\n<p>Jerry Roberts, Linda Meyer and Carol Dermer: I don’t know how you do it, but you do it with style. Thanks for balancing our books and selling those ads. I have a feeling the future looks very bright for the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, David Ferry: You have a lot of potential, my friend. If you stay focused, you’ll more than likely outdo your predecessors as editor in chief, and I expect that you will. Thus, I leave you with the words that I was given upon taking the paper’s top spot: A year from now, this will all seem funny.</p>\n<p>Adios, amigos!</p>\n<p>–Nick Dürnhöfer<br>\n–Daily Nexus<br>\n–Editor in Chief 2007-2008</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16869\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16869\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/","id":3570,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3569,3568,3567],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Judge Joseph Lodge — 1932-2008","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In his almost 50 years on the bench in Santa Barbara County, Judge Joseph Lodge had a reputation that preceded him.

Seasoned trial lawyers and fresh faces out of law school knew that with a gavel in hand, the UCSB criminal justice professor was intelligent, probing and unpredictable all at once. His courtroom was his domain.</p>\n<p>After presiding over thousands of cases, the judge’s friends and co-workers – both in and out of the legal profession – are certain of one thing: The honorable Joe Lodge was absolutely committed to the ideals of his profession.</p>\n<p>“He tried very hard to bring justice to a coarse, harsh system,” said Benjamin Bycel, a prominent criminal attorney tapped to teach the remainder of Lodge’s criminal justice class at UCSB. “Joe tried to bring humanity and ethics into it. He wasn’t successful all the time and he was criticized for it, but his desire to consider the uniqueness of every case was well-respected.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When Lodge pulled into Santa Barbara in the late fifties things were different, Chief Assistant District Attorney Pat McKinley said. In Goleta and the surrounding area, the law was handed down through a Justice Court that met maybe two times a week – and judges did not even have to be lawyers.</p>\n<p>In 1958, the Goleta-Hope Ranch Justice Court judge was no lawyer. Senior Deputy District Attorney and friend Darryl Perlin said Lodge, fresh out of law school, decided to take a chance and give the incumbent a run for his money.</p>\n<p>“Joe Lodge, who knew very few people, did something which today is considered standard operating procedure in political campaigns, but back in 1958 it was unheard of,” Perlin said. “He decided that he would walk the precincts and introduce himself.”</p>\n<p>Lodge won the seat narrowly and never got up from the bench. Over the next half century, Lodge presided over his court in spite of severe back pain and a ten-year battle with lymphoma.</p>\n<p>“Judge Lodge could have retired 30 years ago at full salary but he didn’t,” Perlin said. “The reason was because of his love of the law and the job he did every day. He never missed work.”</p>\n<p>“You never knew exactly what to expect from him on the bench and I believe that’s exactly the way he wanted it,” William Makler, a defense attorney and former public defender, said</p>\n<p>Senior Deputy District Attorney Joyce Dudley said she first met the judge when she was just 19 years old. Lodge had ruled on a ticket she received for having an unleashed dog and she recalled how he told her to “sit” when she stood up out of place. The judge, she said, was sensitive and inquisitive but stood firm by his opinions.</p>\n<p>“He was a force,” Dudley said. “The man embraced life, embraced philosophy, embraced the law, embraced justice, and he was never interested in winning any popularity contests in terms of his rulings.”</p>\n<p>McKinley said that it is a known fact that plenty of lawyers disagreed with Lodge and that it was not easy to foresee his rulings.</p>\n<p>“He was unpredictable – unpredictable for both sides,” McKinley said.</p>\n<p>However, according to McKinley and Perlin, Lodge’s unpredictability was proof that he shot from the hip – and the fact that attorneys in court rarely moved to disqualify him is just the “proof in the pudding.”</p>\n<p>In 2002, a gala party was thrown for Lodge at the Montecito Country Club. The affair was, as his wife Sheila put it, “in lieu of” a retirement party. She said the judge was not about to step down from the bench.</p>\n<p>Perlin said it was also thrown because “it was not thought that he had much longer to live.”</p>\n<p>At the time, Lodge had been living with lymphoma for four years, McKinley said.</p>\n<p>“He handled [lymphoma] with a dignity and an openness that is rare in today’s day and age,” McKinley said. “He never really expressed fear of it. He beat back the cancer three or four times.”</p>\n<p>Perlin said that throughout Lodge’s battle with cancer, he continued to serve as a judge and professor.</p>\n<p>“Many a time, he would go for a cancer treatment in the morning and as soon as he had received it, he would be back on the bench as though nothing had happened,” Perlin said.</p>\n<p>According to Perlin, Lodge was a judge who would not quit, as he even out-lived his “memorial” party by six years.</p>\n<p>“It’s not often someone gets to come to their going-away party,” Perlin said. “But Joe Lodge didn’t go away.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16729\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16729\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/","id":3566,"author":{"id":345,"name":"David Ferry"},"related":[3565,3564,3563],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Years… and Counting","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-03-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For Maj.

Tasked with deposing the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and protecting the United States and her allies from the threat of weapons of mass destruction, the invasion force swiftly routed the Iraqi army.</p>\n<p>Seventy-six hundred miles away, back on our sunny campus, the war was the talk of the town. At least 1,000 UCSB students and staff members participated in a worldwide walkout, marching out of class and into Storke Plaza on March 5, 2003. In the coming weeks, rallies would continue on and off campus, and the pages of this paper’s opinion section would be stuffed with columns and letters about the prudence of preemption.</p>\n<p>However, five years later, some, like former marine-turned-political-activist Dave Hassan, have come to believe that the U.S. has separated itself from the situation in Iraq.</p>\n<p>“It’s really easy to just not be connected and just kind of being like, you know, ‘that sucks'” Hassan said. “The big difference between five years is, I guess, I’m connected.”</p>\n<p>Hassan – who has become vocal in the local peace movement since finishing his time in the Marine Corps as an Arabic translator – said that while he understands how Americans can push the war to the back of their minds, he said that “war is too fucking terrible for [him] to sit by.”</p>\n<p>“I think what really changed it for me was gaining a real sort of conception of what [doing my job as a Marine] really meant,” Hassan said. “When I saw people actually die, it really changed it for me. It shook me up. … I never actually shot anyone, but I have been responsible for people dying in the course of my job, and being responsible for that … actually changed my whole opinion. Gaining an actual connection to the Iraqi people. That’s what changed.”</p>\n<p>Gauchos in the Gulf</p>\n<p>Since 2003, UCSB’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps has sent between 40 and 50 graduates to the Middle East. And in those five years since the Iraq War began, Major Mike Salvo of UCSB’s Surfrider Battalion is proud to say that none of his cadets were wounded or killed.</p>\n<p>The ROTC program trains students throughout their time at the university and commissions cadets as 2nd lieutenants upon graduation. UCSB’s Surfrider Battalion Business Manager and Military Historian Patrick Coffield said last year was a great year for the program. The program commissioned 14 cadets as officers in the United States Army.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of UCSB ROTC graduates will see combat in the Middle East, Coffield said. He and Major Salvo estimated that 70 to 90 percent of graduates from the program find their way into combat situations.</p>\n<p>When asked about last year’s graduating class and why the service had received such a surge in enlistees, Coffield told this reporter to “Do the math.”</p>\n<p>Five years ago  – when the recent graduates were college freshmen – the memory of 9/11 was much more poignant, Major Salvo said, and the United States had just entered a war against one of the most maligned nations in the world.</p>\n<p>“People wanted to serve our country,” Coffield said.</p>\n<p>Brett Jordan, a 24-year-old native of Redondo Beach and 2006 UCSB grad, was part of that influx of students looking to serve their country. After four years of ROTC on campus, Jordan was trained for an additional six months and is now on his eighth month of service in the Anbar Province of Iraq.</p>\n<p> “My class was the first class to join post-9/11,” Jordan said. “We started school in 2002, so all of our class was the one that went in knowing ‘hey, we will definitely be going over there at some point.’ … A little daunting, but still good.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ROTC enrollment numbers are tapering down, however, and Coffield said he expects nine cadets to graduate this summer and another five the year after. Nationally, U.S. military recruitment is also declining, according to Department of Defense undersecretary David S. C. Chu.</p>\n<p>The seeming permanence of the war in Iraq, a negative view of military life and even the rising obesity rates – the military rejects a third of its applicants because of its physical fitness standards – were all cited as likely explanations for the decline.</p>\n<p>From Anbar, Two Different Views of the World</p>\n<p>Hassan and Lt. Jordan both served in the Anbar Province of Iraq. Jordan is currently stationed at al-Asad Air Base- the largest base in al-Anbar – and leads a truck company that drives freight liners packed with supplies throughout Iraq. Hassan was stationed at al-Asad a little more than two years ago, but spent most of his time in local towns.</p>\n<p>In Anbar, those two years made all the difference.</p>\n<p>Before September 2006, the region was famed for its violence, lawlessness and the harrowing battle of Fallujah. Since then, according to the New York Times, local Sunni tribes have come together to work with the U.S. military to oppose militant al-Qaeda operatives. The province is now one of the most stable in Iraq. Jordan agrees with the Times’ assessment and called it “one of the safest areas right now.”</p>\n<p>Hassan, who was stationed at al-Asad Air Base but spent most of his time in the cities of Al-Rutbah and Hit, described a different Anbar Province.</p>\n<p>“While I was there, there were a lot of attacks and we were in the process of leveling the place,” Hassan said. “We were bombing the shit out of the place.”</p>\n<p>Whether there is any correlation, both have come out of Iraq with very different feelings about America’s presence in the Middle Eastern nation.</p>\n<p>“We went in there and removed a government that wasn’t doing some things and the country needed help,” Jordan said. “When people say ‘no war, no war’, you know, war’s not fun. It never has been. But its necessary to do at times.”</p>\n<p>Hassan, on the other hand, said that he does not believe America’s presence in Iraq has or will help the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>“What exactly is the end state we’re going for [in Iraq]?” Hassan said. “We empower death squads and war lords. … In what possible state of scenarios does that lead to democracy in Iraq?”</p>\n<p>Buried in Sand</p>\n<p>Generally, in Santa Barbara, the debate is similar. But the question of whether or not American boots on the ground in Iraq can salvage the country, naturally, has no exact answer.</p>\n<p>“There’s tears in a lot of people,” Michael “the Chaplain” Cervantes said yesterday at Arlington West. “They just don’t want to talk.”</p>\n<p>Cervantes – who is not a priest, but was dubbed “the Chaplain” by his fellow volunteer veterans because of his open ears – said mournful visitors from around the world tend to hold their hearts as they stand and look over the 3,000 small, white crosses planted onto the beach next to Stearns Wharf in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Michael Moore, a serviceman stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, said he believes the U.S. is “doing the right thing.” Holding his infant son yesterday while gazing upon the sea of crosses next to Stearns Wharf, Moore said he was touched by the memorial.</p>\n<p>“It brings tears to my eyes,” he said.</p>\n<p>Volunteers from the local chapter of Veterans for Peace set up the 3,000 crosses almost every Sunday morning to represent the lives lost in Iraq. Stephen Sherrill, the mastermind behind the project and the craftsman behind each cross, said when he started, the memorial had only 287 crosses.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/","id":3568,"author":{"id":345,"name":"David Ferry"},"related":[3567,3566,3565],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Astronomers Strive For Global Network of Telescopes","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Santa Barbara's Las Cumbres Observatory is as immaculately clean as an operating room.

Instead, they look like large black boxes stacked on top of one another. It is hard to believe they cost $150,000.</p>\n<p>The next stop on the tour requires safety goggles. The machining room, which contains all the tools necessary to build a complete telescope, includes several pieces of equipment worth over $1 million. One of these machines is the vertical boring machine – a device used to shape cylindrical objects.</p>\n<p>The last stop of the tour leads outside the observatory to a shed in the parking lot. Inside the shed is Rosing’s prototype for one of his smallest telescopes: an approximately six-foot-tall cylindrical frame of metal. Connected to the structure is a computer, meant to document the telescope’s observations. The center of the metal frame holds a large, round, 40-centimeter in diameter mirror. This is definitely not a telescope meant for backyard observations. At the Las Cumbres Observatory, located at 6740 Cortona Dr., Rosing and his organization hope to build one of the world’s first intricate networks of telescopes across the globe.</p>\n<p>Do You See What I See?: A Global Network</p>\n<p>LCOGT is a privately funded, nonprofit scientific facility that plans to center its network of telescopes in Goleta. The organization will have all the telescopes connected via the Internet and will instantly pass on observations from one site to the next. LCOGT will deploy approximately 60 telescopes in at least six sites in different longitudes across the globe in both hemispheres, including Chile, South Africa, Australia, Hawaii and the Canary Islands.</p>\n<p>Lars Bildsten, a UCSB physics professor and theoretical astrophysicist, said the goal of LCOGT’s telescope project is to always have complete coverage of the sky. The project would also allow Bildsten to further his studies of the supernova – a large luminous explosion with the potential to radiate as much energy as the sun would emit over 10 billion years. Since supernovas only last a few weeks, being able to constantly observe them will make his research more thorough, he said.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested from the theoretical side of new data the network will provide,” he said.</p>\n<p>Rosing said once the project is completed, the telescope will allow researchers to respond to satellite reports of activity in the atmosphere instantaneously. Since LCOGT will place telescopes in locations all over the world with different time zones, Rosing said it will not matter what time of the day it is; it is always dark enough to observe the sky in at least one location.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have the first capability ever implemented at being able to do a very long series of observations of things that go bump in the night,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Rosing, such 24-hour surveillance will allow the scientific community to learn new facts about the stars. For example, he said that currently the vibrations of new stars can only be watched for about eight hours at a time. Without being able to watch the star for 24 hours straight, astronomers cannot fully understand the frequency of the star’s oscillation, he said.</p>\n<p>Space Is the Place: The Journey Ahead</p>\n<p>By the end of 2012, Rosing said his global telescope network will consist of approximately 40 0.4-meter telescopes, 20 one-meter telescopes and two two-meter telescopes. Currently, Bildsten said there is no standard size for telescopes, but the biggest ones are 10 meters, located at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Matt Dubberly, an LCOGT mechanical engineer, said a one-meter telescope will collect 100 centimeters of light, which is a much greater amount of light than the human eye can handle. On average, the human pupil is between 5.5-0.8 millimeters in diameter.</p>\n<p>Dubberly also said that all the one-meter and two-meter telescopes will be attached to 16 megapixel spectral cameras.</p>\n<p>“The cameras are 1,000 times more sensitive than your eye,” Dubberly said. “They get really high resolution pictures of faint objects out in space.”</p>\n<p>LCOGT Scientific Director Tim Brown said the sites for the telescopes were determined by how easy it would be to transport the telescopes, and whether or not Internet connectivity was possible. He said it is important to have Internet connectivity because the telescopes must be able to send information back to the database in Goleta.</p>\n<p>“[The telescopes] will be independent in the sense that each one can point anywhere in the sky at any target that’s visible to it at anytime,” Brown said. “But it will all be controlled from a central location.”</p>\n<p>The telescopes can also follow instructions sent from the central computer in Goleta and observe the same targets, he said.</p>\n<p>Bildsten said most sites will have three one-meter telescopes in case one breaks down. Brown said having three one-meter telescopes on each site will allow LCOGT to conduct different studies simultaneously in fields such as photometry, in which researchers study light intensity, and spectroscopy – the study of a material’s chemical composition via the light emitted.</p>\n<p>LCOGT will complete the first prototype for the one-meter telescopes by early 2009, Rosing said. By the end of 2010, the organization will deploy all the 0.4-meter telescopes, and by 2012, it will place all of the one-meter telescopes. Currently, LCOGT manages the two two-meter telescopes, called the Faulkes Telescope North – located at Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii – and the Faulkes Telescope South – located at the Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales, Australia.</p>\n<p>In addition to building telescopes, Rosing said the organization will require large amounts of data space to store all the information collected by the telescopes.</p>\n<p>“[The telescopes] will be generating a few hundred gigs a night of information, which will flow back to the large cluster computing facility,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>Even after all the telescopes are deployed, Rosing said the group must continue to maintain them by building and installing better cameras as detective technology improves.</p>\n<p>“Our plan for the next 20 years is to study and do as much science as we can,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>Brown said site preparation expenses – pouring concrete, putting in power-lines, placing telescopes and acquiring permits – cost at least $50,000. In addition, he said the 0.4-meter telescopes cost around $50,000 each to build, and the one-meter telescopes cost approximately $1 million.</p>\n<p>Universe-ity Collaboration</p>\n<p>Sometime between late summer and early autumn, Brown said LCOGT will place a 0.8-meter telescope at the UCSB-managed Sedgwick Reserve, located in the Santa Ynez Valley. This telescope will have an eyepiece on it, which means spectators can look through it, he said.</p>\n<p>Rosing said he chose to deploy a telescope at Sedgwick because LCOGT needed a large telescope to test and a relatively close dark sky site to test it.</p>\n<p>“After discussing it, it was obvious to us that making a telescope available to UCSB astronomers and students in general was an added benefit,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>In addition, Rosing said Sedgwick has many outreach programs and a telescope would benefit those programs.</p>\n<p>“Part of the night is what goes on up in the sky, and it would be nice to be able to see it,” Rosing said. “We can do that from Sedgwick because it’s dark.”</p>\n<p>Rosing said the majority of engineering and manufacturing and all the software developments are done within LCOGT. However, he said LCOGT has an extensive collaboration in the astronomy field, including seven to 10 postdoctoral fellows connected with UC astrophysicists, UCSB, the University of Hawaii, UC Berkeley and the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</p>\n<p>In addition, Brown said LCOGT works with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope – an eight-meter telescope that will survey the entire sky and be operational in five years. Brown said the project also has other collaborations, including SuperWASP, a British organization that searches for new planets.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15987\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15987\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/","id":3567,"author":{"id":344,"name":"Sabrina Ricci"},"related":[3566,3565,3564],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":8,"route":"/categories/news/feature","highestPage":9}},"__N_SSG":true}
