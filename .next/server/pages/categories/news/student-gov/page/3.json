Fellowship Program and changing the dynamic of the senate through the implementation of i&gt;clickers in the voting process.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said IVP is “kind of a silent, behind-the-scenes job” because the primary functions of the position are to run senate meetings, maintain the internal functions of the association and work on its own projects.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She is most proud of her work to expand the A.S. Fellowship, which allows students to become fellows to A.S. senators and executives and learn about the inner workings of the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, 100 students applied to be fellows and 66 were chosen. She added that many fellows are running for A.S. positions in this election.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is what I wanted it to be,” Jordan said. “I wanted it to be somewhere people could actually learn about the internal functions of the association before diving into a role.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her campaign for IVP, Jordan stressed her interest in working with freshmen to increase their engagement with A.S. While she does not know how to gauge the effectiveness of her efforts, Jordan said she tabled in residence halls and reached out to freshmen in the Summer Start Program and during Week of Welcome. She hopes the work she did encouraged freshmen to join A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her time as IVP, Jordan was charged with leading senate meetings, which at times could become disorderly when senators disagreed on issues or when controversial topics were discussed at public forum.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In November, the senate moved its meeting into Corwin Pavilion from its normal Flying A Room in the UCen as it planned to vote on a resolution that would allow conservative orator Ben Shapiro to speak on campus. The meeting lasted six hours, and the senate voted to approve the resolution.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, she was able to maintain a stable climate during the meeting because she established agreements and rules everyone had to adhere to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also said while public forums can cause tensions to run high and extend senate meetings, she thinks it is “really beautiful” when so many students come to voice their concerns to the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The biggest part about that is when someone comes to talk to the senators, I think as an exec or as a senator, people forget that these people are taking time out of their day-to-day schedules to come and speak,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Whatever they’re talking about is a part of their reality, so in a situation where a senate meeting goes for six hours, it’s not something people can see as something bad, but in reality more students are engaged in the issues,” she added.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nushi Yapabandara, a third-year philosophy major, ran against Jordan for IVP in the A.S. election last spring. She said she “commends” Jordan for the way she has handled the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara said she hopes next year’s IVP is “able to maintain the level of strictness and discipline and respect that Natalie has … made a standard in senate meetings.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said many unexpected projects arose during her term that were not on her campaign platform, including the creation of an A.S. orientation program, which acts as a guide to those first introduced to the association, as well as the projects that fellows in the fellowship program took on themselves.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She was most excited about the designation of an A.S. liaison from Counseling and Psychological Services to be available with students who work within A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, A.S. is a “lifestyle” and students make choices and sacrifices based on their involvement in the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A lot of students, because of how taxing it can be, were experiencing a lot of mental health stresses,” Jordan said. “And I can totally understand that; I’ve been there.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said the designated liaison has done group sessions with the senate, attends senate meetings and has been involved in the current elections by checking in with the candidates’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also reflected on the projects she hoped to do but was unable to complete, including bringing food trucks in the Arbor during finals week and using i&gt;clickers during senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, university administrations halted the plan for food trucks. She said when she realized her i&gt;clicker plan would not work, she altered the goal to eventually attain a more permanent space for senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The IVP said that at the beginning of her term, she was “so bad at delegating,” which posed a learning curve for her as she settled into IVP.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’m kind of a controlling person and I want things to go my way … because I think sometimes I understand the greater picture, and it’s very naive of me to think that and I realize that,” Jordan said. “Sometimes I realize that instead of controlling a situation, it’s better to let others take a shot at it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara, who worked as Jordan’s director of programming during Fall Quarter, said she recognized Jordan’s struggle to give other staff members tasks as she “gunned through” and tried to do everything herself.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Yapabandara, this hindered Jordan’s ability to complete all the projects she wanted to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like she could have been a lot more transparent and accessible to everyone,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said that after her time as IVP, she has realized that the position is “experiential learning.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“No matter how much preparation you’ve had before or experience with this community, there’s really no way to learn how to manage an association of over 800 students overnight,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, the next elected IVP needs to focus on preserving a stable environment at senate meetings. She attributes her ability to handle the senate to the fact that she was an independent executive and “never had to play any games with anyone.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think the next IVP needs to make sure they’re maintaining an unbiased viewpoint and also [make] sure that they’re really checking in with everyone and maintaining a really positive climate,” Jordan said. “You can only do so much, but trying at least matters.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As her time as IVP comes to an end and A.S. election season is almost over, Jordan said she loved the chance to be a “change-maker” in the association and now understands more about herself and her capabilities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sleep is way overrated,” Jordan said. “Four hours a night is the slumber of champions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said after her term is complete, she will continue her position as vice president of the Isla Vista Community Service District as well as her full-time job as the senior event coordinator at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77393\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77393\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/","id":3955,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3954,3953,3952],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: EVPLA Ashcon Minoiefar","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2017-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-29-at-9.53.18-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-29-at-9.53.18-AM.png?resize=714%2C599&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus has compiled profiles of our current elected officials to reflect on their past year in office.

Its purpose was to serve as an alternative to what Schunk called “over-policing.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Public Safety Commission (ASPSC) later took charge of UCIV, and the program only operated during Deltopia and Halloween in the years to follow. When Minoiefar entered the office, he intended to work alongside ASPSC to make the program a weekly operation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Expansion of the program had a “slower start,” he said, because ASPSC relied mostly on their hired staff. They later found more success when they were able to “build more of a volunteer pool.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he assisted ASPSC in marketing for volunteers, suggesting to the UCIV organizers that they open the opportunity for different student groups to “sponsor a weekend.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One student group that did this recently, Minoiefar said, was Campus Democrats, which provided “a bunch of volunteers” for the weekend they sponsored.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[UCIV] is headed in the right direction, and I’m really happy to know that it’s going to stay here after I leave,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another goal for Minoiefar was to implement a policy of medical amnesty, which would protect UCSB students from legal charges if they are hospitalized while committing unlawful activities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar had been working with A.S. President Austin Hechler for over a year to regulate medical amnesty. Hechler said they came up with the idea after the university held a fraternity chapter liable for an unconscious partygoer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said the problem exists outside this specific incident as well, saying students in residence halls and other groups, like sports teams, are often afraid to call 911 during parties.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Medical amnesty is state law, but it is not currently part of university policy. Minoiefar and Hechler have, for the past year, been drafting a new campus regulation called “the responsible action protocol.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said the draft passed a UCSB Campus Regulation committee “at the very beginning of this quarter,” and it now awaits approval by Chancellor Henry T. Yang and UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar will soon be meeting with officials from UCSB Judicial Affairs to discuss implementation of the responsible action protocol, which he said is “really, really important.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’ve seen it work with student groups a lot … Students know that they can call [911] and be safe,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar also set out this year to decrease police presence at Deltopia, I.V.’s annual Spring Break celebration along Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Both UCPD and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) sent fewer police officers to Isla Vista this Deltopia, anticipating smaller crowds than in years prior. UCPD deployed approximately 70 officers for Deltopia this year, down from approximately 100 in 2016. SBSO did not want to disclose the number of officers it assigned.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Attendance increased to approximately 8,000 people this year, up from approximately 3,500 in 2016. Police made 42 different arrests this year, which is slightly more than last year but significantly lower than the number of arrests made the previous year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There were a total of 14 medical transports this year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think Deltopia was a good enough of an event,” Minoiefar said. “I really wish that the [number of] medical transports could have been a lot lower. That, for me, is a benchmark of a successful day: making sure people are safe.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said several factors played into the decreased police presence at Deltopia this year. For one, he said police have “caught on” to public perceptions of having law enforcement at the event. He said having Spring Insight on the same weekend also helped.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[Deltopia] being on Spring Insight kinda helped because the school wanted a good image there and was obviously concerned with how parents see this campus,” he said. “I wish we would have gotten on that train a little faster.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he sees Deltopia 2016 as a “measuring point” for what police presence during Deltopia could look like in future years.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would argue that I think it was a manageable day,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he came into the EVPLA “pretty aware of what it’s like,” having for years prior been involved in I.V.’s political scene.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I guess one thing that kind of surprised me was the degree of the kind of power that student leadership has,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The EVPLA really can establish himself as a mobilizer of student interests and a representative of student interests,” he said. “They are really heeded and looked to for a lot of answers, which was very … enlightening.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In his year serving in the position, Minoiefar said he has grown to be more of a delegator in his leadership style, whereas he said he used to be “kind of a micromanager.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kristen Armellini, Minoiefar’s deputy chief of staff, said she has also saw this growth in Minoiefar, especially when it came to sending representatives to meetings on his behalf.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I was going to meetings for him, and he really wanted to make sure I knew the position through and through,” she said. “He would let me go to meetings for him [and] would make sure we were educated on everything.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Madison Hechler, the EVPLA chief of staff, said Minoiefar teaching her was “an opportunity for him to share his passion for Isla Vista” and not a “chore.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar plans to receive his degree in history of public policy in June.

Senate then voted unanimously to table the bylaw for one week, but senators still did not produce the standard deviation on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>This bylaw has faced significant backlash from (BCUs). Certain BCUs feel that the bylaw negatively affects minority students and that Senate generally lacks communication with BCUs on issues that directly affect them.</p>\n<p>“Of course everyone wants their student fees cut,” Luvia Solis, co-chair for Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.), said.</p>\n<p>n light of the newly passed bylaw, she said she doubts S.C.O.R.E. will have the ability to put on conferences that have been attended annually.</p>\n<p>“In these conferences, it’s the only time when you get to network with other UCs and build coalitions, like for example, now immigration is a really big thing … At the Student of Color Conference there was an immigration caucus, [and] all UC students were working on how to work with the Regents, how to protect our students,” she said. “That doesn’t just happen through Facebook.”</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, co-chair of Queer Commission, said a decrease in conference allocations will pull funding from on-campus activities.</p>\n<p>“A lot of other organizations won’t be able to get their conferences, which means they will have to go to other funding groups,” Dumlao said. “Those groups are going to have to spend money that they would otherwise spend on weekly programming events [or] maybe other quarterly events.”</p>\n<p>He also said the funding Queer Commission received for conferences allowed them to put on more local programming for smaller queer groups.</p>\n<p>The bylaw also incentivizes certain post-event obligations. If the campus organization does not submit an event summary within two weeks or hold a workshop within two months, A.S. will place the group on temporary “funding probation,” which will prevent future funding until the requirements are met.</p>\n<p>Hobson said the Finance and Business Committee received only one post-conference report this year.</p>\n<p>Solis said she believes conferences are an investment.</p>\n<p>“Every single student came back to campus and is doing something now,” she said. “You learn things at conferences that you don’t get to learn here, and you always bring it back to your community.”</p>\n<p>She also said students of all backgrounds are welcome to join conferences.</p>\n<p>Both Solis and Dumlao expressed concern that, despite being co-chairs of BCUs, senators did not ask for their feedback even though the bylaw directly affects them.</p>\n<p>“How are you supposed to vote on something you have no idea about; you’re so disconnected,” Solis said.</p>\n<p>Last week, A.S. President Austin Hechler said it is important to communicate with BCUs, and he suggested that honoraria be made contingent on attending BCU meetings. He said it is Senate’s job to communicate, and they are currently failing at doing so.</p>\n<p>Thao Nguyen, co-chair of A.S. Womyn’s Commission, also said Senate has been uncommunicative.</p>\n<p>“A solution would be for them to reach out to us more and for them to involve us in this process before jumping the gun and taking away funding,” Nguyen said. “We’re, like, running around with our heads cut off.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Senate passed a resolution on Wednesday to preserve El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room, which is used by several different cultural organizations on campus. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate passed a resolution to preserve the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room Wednesday following concerns that the historic building would be demolished in 45 days.</p>\n<p>The 40-year-old building is located behind the UCSB Library and is used as a gathering space for several cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>Senators Lesly Silva and Jesse Velasquez authored the resolution and presented it at Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting. The resolution supports student groups <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/students-told-to-evacuate-el-centro-annex-before-possible-demolition/\" target=\"_blank\">who have pushed to preserve the building</a>, asking that it be recognized as a cultural artifact.</p>\n<p>“El Centro Arnulfo Casillas is an open space that can be used and is used by many groups from every race, religion, gender identity, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, status, and creed,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Campus building official Ed Schmittgen sent a notice to campus architect Marc Fisher on Jan. 9 saying that consultants found the trailer’s integrity was compromised following inspection.</p>\n<p>The report lists insect infestation and dry rot on the building’s floor, rust and corrosion on supporting steel beams and lack of adequate ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor. It concludes that the building’s problems create an unsafe condition in case of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>The building was categorized as a “severe” life risk per the UC Seismic Policy, Schmittgen said, and advised that the building be either improved or demolished in 45 days’ time. Administrators suggested that although the trailer would be difficult to preserve due to its 10-year lifespan, the building’s artwork could be relocated.</p>\n<p>Over 50 students gathered in the El Centro annex the following Friday to negotiate other options with campus administration. Among those in attendance were Schmittgen, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Vice Chancellor of Campus Design and Facilities Marc Fisher.</p>\n<p>Students listed several concerns, saying the 45-day evacuation timeline was restrictive, administrators had not maintained the building properly and the University could not remove students’ home-away-from-home.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB received distinction and grant money as a Hispanic Serving Institution in 2016, the A.S. resolution states “the Hispanic and Latinx community has seen little to no return on this money that their communities have been promised.”</p>\n<p>“It is clearly stated that ‘We, the UCSB Associated Students 67th Senate, represent and advocate for the undergraduate student body and strive to effectively address their concerns,’ and there is a clear argument that a large group of students who depend on this space want the 67th Senate to act upon their concerns and support them,” the resolution adds.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the A.S. Senate passed the resolution without objection.</p>\n<p>“At this point this has been an ongoing battle for about 45 years,” Senator Silva said. “The whole goal is to finally end this and make it a permanent space that isn’t being constantly threatened.”</p>\n<p>Students will gather in the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room for another meeting with administration on Friday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/","id":3969,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3968,3967,3966],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Position Vacancies the Focus of Wednesday’s Senate Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A.S. Senate is aiming to create a more organized process for filling vacancies.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students (A.S.) Senate discussed the resignations and appointments of four members at Wednesday’s meeting and how the vacancies will call for the creation of a permanent system of reappointments.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Senate experienced numerous vacancies, but still does not have a clear system devised to replace the senators’ positions. The past unorganized process resulted in conflict as the inconsistency prolonged the senator appointments. Bryan Velasquez’s resignation reminds the association of the importance of a clear procedure when appointing new senators.</p>\n<p>Velasquez, a second-year music major, resigned from his position as an on-campus senator during the 10th week of Fall Quarter, and Senate now must fulfill the position. According to Velasquez, his resignation was prompted by “personal reasons,” and he enjoyed working with Senate.</p>\n<p>“A lot of things happened towards the end of the quarter, and I thought it was best to take some time to figure things out,” Velasquez said.</p>\n<p>He said he would consider running for Senate again in the future, but “[doesn’t] see that happening any time soon.”</p>\n<p>“I would definitely be interested [in joining Senate again],” he said. “They’re all amazing people, and we all work really well together.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year economics major Ashley Selki will organize an ad-hoc committee where current senators will create a process to appoint a new senator to fill Velasquez’s vacancy. The position will then be opened for students to run, and the Senate has five weeks to appoint a new senator.</p>\n<p>EVPLA and fourth-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar encouraged the senators to take their time devising a permanent system as he recalled the vacancies the Senate experienced during his own term last year.</p>\n<p>“I very much encourage you to take your time … make a system, make it good, make it work,” Minoiefar said. “It can affect the whole association.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar warned the Senate against arguing with each other and beginning the appointment process before a proper system is created. He said this would lead to more problems during this appointment and in future cases.</p>\n<p>“Whether you think you’re right, you all need to talk about it in here,” he said. “If you’re not happy with the process before you start, it is going to get a lot worse.”</p>\n<p>The Senate also opened the first meeting of the quarter with the swearing in of second-year political science and communication double major Izabella Kipnis as a new off-campus senator. Kipnis had previously worked with the Senate in the Honoraria Committee, a position that will now be filled by third-year political science major Jordan Goulet.</p>\n<p>Kipnis is currently working on transitioning into the Senate and is beginning to focus on working with I.V. Tenants Union in regards to the rising amount of evictions in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Letters and Science Senator Jasmine Sandhu, third-year biopsychology and sociology double major, was also appointed as the new vice chair of the Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

Among other bill items, Senate passed an honoraria cap which ensures that general appointed officials shall not receive honoraria higher than $200 per quarter, chairs or vice chairs shall not receive higher that $350 and senators shall not receive higher than $400.

In the demand for a special Senate meeting, signees claimed that senate violated the A.S. 2015-16 Legal Code in passing the bill, because BCU chairs affected by the process were not directly contacted. According to the legal code, A.S. can legally amend honoraria policies every Winter Quarter of an even year after having “written or oral consultation with all parties involved.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68981\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68981\" data-attachment-id=\"68981\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/students-clash-over-honoraria-charges/senate-march-9_by-lorenzo-basilio-16/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate March 9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68981\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68981\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that you all think this is a communicative process boggles my mind,” Akshaya Natarajan, signee of the demand, off-campus senator and second-year political science and Asian-American studies double major, said.

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss a resolution regarding bicycles stopping at stop signs and a bill on increasing transparency within A.S.</p>\n<p>The resolution, titled “A Resolution Calling upon UCPD, and Santa Barbara Sheriff Department, and the California Highway Patrol to Allow Bicycles to Treat Stop Signs and Red Lights as Yield Signs,” called for adoption of Idaho Stop, which allows bicyclists to legally treat stop signs as yield signs. This has been Idaho state law since 1982, but has yet to be implemented anywhere else. The Senate item, “A Bill to Increase Transparency and Oversight of Student Fees,” would make the use of student fees and the funding of campus entities clearer to the public.</p>\n<p>In open forum, second-year math major Andrew Pragin said the Idaho Stop would be impractical off-campus.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve been out in the community of Isla Vista, been to the meetings on bike safety, you’d know that the Idaho Stop resolution is not feasible at all,” Pragin said. “UCPD can have the Idaho Stop on campus. [That’s] totally fine until people leave campus to go to I.V. [because] laws change.”</p>\n<p>Pragin also said there could be problems with enforcement, as it would most likely be a county ordinance and not a state law.</p>\n<p>“People can start yielding at stop signs in I.V. because that’s county land. If you want the county to write an ordinance, all right, but then similar problem, Idaho is a state,” Pragin said. “People would come into the county and have to obey a different law than other places in the state, and it’s kind of weird, and it gives liability to the county.”</p>\n<p>Pragin also said the “real problem” is bicyclists’ reluctance to follow traffic laws.</p>\n<p>“What problem are you trying to solve with this resolution, the fact that people are getting tickets?” Pragin said, “They’re getting tickets because they’re not following the law. They’re not stopping at the stop signs, and it’s dangerous. People don’t care; they seem to want to kill themselves.”</p>\n<p>Pragin said I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) should better enforce stop sign laws in I.V.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68409\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68409\" data-attachment-id=\"68409\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/senate_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68409\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“They approach the stop signs as if they don’t exist.

I would want this tabled so I can do research,” Mariano said. “This is why, in Campus Affairs, I brought up the constitutionality of it.”</p>\n<p>Akshaya Natarajan, off-campus senator and second-year Asian American studies and political science double major said she agreed with Constantino.</p>\n<p>“I’m in support of this, but, just wondering, did you approach Judicial Council or the Attorney General about this?” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Constantino said he has not heard from Judicial Council or the Attorney General, which he believes indicates they have no issues with it.</p>\n<p>“I assume that they have no problems with it, because this is the most transparent bill I have ever seen this body put out,” Constantino said. “Jimmy [Villarreal, A.S. President] is the only person to reach out to me regarding this bill. I’ve made a website about it; there’s a comment page about it, and no one has made any comments about it.”</p>\n<p>Constantino said he thinks A.S. has the power to deny reaffirmation, but he is not positive.</p>\n<p>“The only issue seems to be whether or not we can stop groups from reaffirming their fee referendum, and that doesn’t seem to be an issue with Elections committee on the basis that they have turned down reaffirmations in the past,” Constantino said.</p>\n<p>“A Bill to Increase Transparency and Oversight of Student Fees” was passed in a 14-5-0 vote.</p>\n<p>Also during the meeting, “A Resolution to Promote Feedback on the Association,” “A Resolution Endorsing the Educational Awareness of AB 1007” and “A Resolution Endorsing the Educational Awareness of Senate Bill 656”  were sent to External Affairs, “A Resolution to Create a Temporary Committee for University Lobby Day” was sent to Campus Affairs while “A Resolution To Promote a More Inclusive UCSB Campus” and “A Resolution to Create a Group Project to Create a Petition Service For AS” were tabled for a week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/","id":3962,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3961,3960,3959],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss Senator Dustin Larrazolo’s possible resignation, funding for the Anscombe Society’s debate on marriage and recent protests against the California Border Patrol’s (CBP) Career Fair presence.</p>\n<p>Larrazolo, a CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major, gave a speech in public forum citing reasons for his possible resignation at the end of the Winter 2016 Quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Larrazolo, he began to consider resignation after fellow senate members allegedly met with Hispanic and queer communities with which he was working, without Larrazolo’s knowledge, to work against his plan to host a public open caucus. The caucus, which Larrazolo planned to host at his house, would have been an opportunity for students to discuss concerns and ideas going into the upcoming spring elections and the potential founding of a new political party.</p>\n<p>“Tonight I am pouring out my heart because I ran for office with promise that I would have voices be heard or I’d die trying,” Larrazolo said. “Seeing those whom I’ve trusted in this process meet in secret to end open caucus spaces that I was going to host at my own home has pushed me to the brink.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said he was hospitalized for mental health reasons after becoming excluded from the Hispanic and queer communities with which he identified.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been going through a lot lately,” Larrazolo said. “To lose the safe spaces I have built here on campus, that’s all I had left.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said many senators do not follow the values of the identities of which they claim to have.</p>\n<p>“It is disgraceful that some of you label yourselves as allies and progressives. OPP [Open People’s Party] is not the only problem, so stop using it to protect your work as well,” Larrazolo said. “I only wanted to represent queers, Latinos and CCS students.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said A.S. political parties create the illusion of unity under shared values, which according to Larrazolo is not an accurate representation of OPP.</p>\n<p>“I was put into some kind of battle that I thought I had to fight and I want to apologize to those of you who have been afflicted by this whole predicament of political parties,” Larrazolo said. “We have aligned ourselves with things that do not exist. I am sorry to all of you, and with this I am announcing possibly my intent of resignation.”</p>\n<p>Senate also discussed the Anscombe Society’s plan to host a debate between scholars for and against “nontraditional marriage,” and its role, or lack thereof, in funding the event. The Anscombe Society, which advocates for traditional marriage as the only valid definition of marriage, requested funding from A.S. Finance and Business Committee (A.S. F&amp;B), an A.S. Senate entity, for a debate between Dr. Ryan T. Anderson and UCSB philosophy professor Dr. Quentin Gee.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B originally chose not to fund the event, and the Anscombe Society spoke to Senate to challenge the decision.</p>\n<p>Carlos Flores, Anscombe Society president and fourth-year philosophy major, said the A.S. F&amp;B rational to not fund the debates based on the capabilities of the participants was not justified.</p>\n<p>“Whether you think that Dr. Gee is a capable opponent or whether this event is balanced should be irrelevant in your decision on whether to provided funding,” Flores said. “If balance were a criteria for providing funds, no leftist speaker would be funded on this campus.”</p>\n<p>Flores said the event is an academic event that promotes political and philosophical discussion.</p>\n<p>“It contributes to the mission of this institution as an institution of learning,” Flores said. “It is also balanced to the extent that this is a debate and Dr. Gee, I assure you, is a good debate opponent.”</p>\n<p>Flores said funding from A.S. is “crucial” if the event is to occur.</p>\n<p>“As it stands, we do not have sufficient funds for Anderson’s honorarium expenses and room rental costs and CSO’s, etc.,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>Senate voted to review A.S. F&amp;B minutes and fully funded the event in a 20-0-1 vote.</p>\n<p>Senate also discussed the protests that broke out against CBP at the recent Career Fair, which some students found upsetting.</p>\n<p>Michael Torbati, off-campus senator and third-year economics and accounting major, said the protest was not what he expected it to be and that peers have told him they believe it negatively impacted the school.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that it didn’t really get carried out the way I thought it would, what we were told would happen in Senate,” Torbati said. “Entering the actual Career Fair was probably not the best decision, I was told from people who were there. They told me that it didn’t really do well for our reputation [to employers].”</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Fung, off-campus senator and third-year economics and accounting major, said the protest made students nervous to talk to the employers, which he feels defeats the purpose of a career fair.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t fair to the students. I’m not saying anything against the protest itself, but the way it was carried out,” Fung said. “I felt embarrassed when I was walking around the area saying ‘I stood behind that,’ because when I was there, from what I saw and what I heard, I couldn’t stand behind that.”</p>\n<p>Akshaya Natarajan, off-campus senator and second-year political science major, said she understands the concerns of the students attending the Career Fair, but A.S. does not understand what undocumented students go through.</p>\n<p>“These are very valid concerns, and I completely understand that this is definitely a shame that students felt uncomfortable and perhaps personally attacked, but we also have to keep in mind that most of us sitting at this table are not in the shoes of these people,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, “A Resolution Directing the Executive Director to support The Green Initiative Fund Grant Application for BigBelly Solar Compost, Recycling, and Landfill Bins at the Pardall Center” was sent to immediate consideration, where it was passed unanimously.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67945\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67945\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/","id":3977,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3976,3975,3974],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Considers Situation of On-Campus Senator in University Apartments, More","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students (A.S.)

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room to discuss an unprecedented situation regarding the status of an off-campus senator who moved to an on-campus apartment.</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, off-campus senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major, reported to have moved from an off-campus apartment in Isla Vista into the “on-campus” Sierra Madre apartments. Under these circumstances, Melgoza does not represent her constituency because she is not living off-campus. A.S. Senate discussed whether Melgoza should resign and reapply to the other two open senate positions, if they should vote to make an exception to the bylaws or change the A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>Kimia Hashemian, A.S. internal vice president and fourth-year sociology major, said the legal code is “unclear” and does not provide guidelines on what do if a senator’s situation changes to one in which they do not represent their constituency.</p>\n<p>“It does say you have to remain in your constituency, but it never explains what to do in unforeseen circumstances where you have to move or what’s going to happen with the new undergraduate housing,” Hashemian said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she has been looking for alternative housing for the past three weeks, and the Sierra Madre apartments ended up being her “only” choice.</p>\n<p>“I asked the university for help. The only thing that they could offer me was Sierra Madre apartments,” Melgoza said. “I did discuss with administration, and I did discuss this with the Vice Chancellor, that I am an off-campus senator, that I was worried about what would happen with my position.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said senate has the option to change the A.S. Legal Code to fit Melgoza’s situation or make a “one time exception” to have Melgoza keep her senate seat.</p>\n<p>“It’s up to you all to make that definition and you all can make the motion to allow Senator Melgoza be an off-campus senator, even though she’s living in Sierra Madre while you all make changes to bylaws,” Hashemian said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67717\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67717\" data-attachment-id=\"67717\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/senate-considers-situation-of-on-campus-senator-in-university-apartments-more/senate_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67717\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67717\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When the senate motioned to let the off-campus senator remain in Senate despite constituency issues, a hand vote of 10-3-8 stopped the motion from passing.</p>\n<p>Senate discussed Melgoza switching to one of the two vacant senate seats, an on-campus senator position and a letters and science senator, but was rejected since it would violate the elections code.</p>\n<p>Niki Elyasi, A.S. senator and second-year biopsychology major, said she will motion to table the approval in order for Melgoza to write a proposal describing how she will continue to serve her off-campus constituency while living on-campus.</p>\n<p>“I motion to table the approval for a week until we get a proposal from Senator Melgoza and then decide next week whether or not she should be sworn in or just switched I guess, or do nothing,” Elyasi said. “With the stipulation that Senator Melgoza will write a proposal on how she will represent off campus students while living in a university owned apartment.”</p>\n<p>The motion was passed in a unanimous decision.</p>\n<p>Alexander Bates, A.S. senator and second-year history major, was appointed to the Finance and Business committee.

Senate voted 13 to 8 on Wednesday to table a bill that would require student political parties to register as Office of Student Life (OSL) groups and abide by judicial procedures for claims of hazing or discrimination.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double-major Nawar Nemeh presented the bill, titled, “A Bill to Update Article XVII Section 5, 7, &amp; 8,” in response to alleged hazing of candidates within the Open People’s Party (OPP) and low student turnout for past elections. Under the bill, an OSL advisor would be assigned to each political party to monitor the group for any misconduct.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and second-year Asian-American studies and political science double-major Akshaya Natarajan said she supports the bill because of her prior experience campaigning with OPP.</p>\n<p>“As a senator that ran with OPP this past election cycle, I felt tokenized, and I felt whitewashed as a woman of color, flat out,” Natarajan said. “When I saw [my] picture, I literally laughed out loud. I was like what the fuck? I am three shades lighter than I actually am … and I was terrified.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year history of public policy and political science double-major Jerel Constantino said that political parties can be monitored internally rather than through OSL.</p>\n<p>“[A.S. staff members] are employed because they’re to not have conflicts of interest — it’s how they are employed,” Constantino said. “Their job is to be impartial and to work for the students. I have no concern of giving them authority.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik said he supports the bill, recalling a time he felt pressured by members of his party.</p>\n<p>“I had two papers due, I was on academic probation in my classes and I told one of the party leaders specifically … if I don’t finish these papers, I will be ineligible to run because I will get Fs in my classes,” Abdalmalik said. “Their response was, ‘you’re really letting everyone down; you have to fucking go or else.’”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said requiring parties to register as OSL groups would not lead to OSL governing the A.S. program as a whole.</p>\n<p>“Parties … are not A.S, it’s that simple,” Abdalmalik said. “A party is a political faction that runs in order to get a place in A.S. This bill would not be regulating A.S as an organization, it would be regulating an unregulated, unchecked power that has the potential — and has in the past — to harm students in it.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year political science major Austin Hechler said an OSL advisor might be ineffective, suggesting that A.S. staff members regulate the parties because they are more familiar with the process and accessible to senators.</p>\n<p>“The fact that having parties join as an OSL group will make hazing stop, that is completely false,” Hechler said. “I feel like someone who’s in A.S. that you see on a daily basis . . . [members] would be more comfortable to report hazing to them because they are an accessible advisor than someone who is in OSL that comes around once a year.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza said groups form a hierarchy within A.S.</p>\n<p>“We’re being blind to the fact that O.P.P. runs year round. Let’s be honest; if you’re not in that little clique of OPP, if you’re not connected to A.S., you’re not going to know that you can run for an exec. position or senator because that option is not publicized everywhere,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan said that having political parties exist year-round would increase tension and further divide party lines within A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, I think it’s going to create more of a bubble than we already have,” Jordan said. “I think if we put a political party to our name year round, we get this tunnel vision of ‘oh I must align with my party’s ideals.’”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he proposed the bill to shed light on the culture of hazing within A.S., adding that members can treat each other in the “most toxic of ways” and very few victims feel comfortable coming forward.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of cases of students feeling victimized for their sexualities, feeling victimized about their work ethic, their relationships,” Nemeh said. “People don’t talk about how we treat each other and how we behave. I think it’s about damn time we do.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said even though A.S. voted to table the bill indefinitely, starting a conversation about hazing within A.S. is also important.</p>\n<p>“My bill intended to bring that to the forefront, and in that sense, I do think it was successful regardless of the fact that it was tabled indefinitely,” Nemeh said. “It opened up a conversation about something that no one has talked about before, which is student conduct within the association.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal declined comment until he can review Wednesday’s senate minutes.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65969\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65969\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/","id":3976,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3975,3974,3973],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Discuss Bills Vetoed by A.S.

President Jimmy Villarreal’s veto of two bills at last week’s meeting. Their motions failed to pass.</em> John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students (A.S.) Senate met Wednesday night in the Flying A Room of the UCen to discuss A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal’s vetoes of two bills.</p>\n<p>The bills, “A Bill to Establish A.S. Commissions for the CCS Student Council and CoE Student Council” and “A Bill to Redefine the A.S. Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) Fund,” passed unanimously at last week’s Senate meeting. Public Forum included multiple College of Creative Studies (CCS) students speaking in support of the bill to establish student government in CCS and the College of Engineering (CoE).</p>\n<p>First-year CCS student Katie Feerst said CCS and CoE are underrepresented on campus, so she supports the bill to establish student government for the two colleges.</p>\n<p>“CCS has existed since 1967. We have been in UCSB for a long time, yet we have yet to have a student council,” Feerst said. “We should all have representation, even if we are smaller than College of Letters and Sciences. We should all be able to integrate as part of UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he vetoed the bill because the creation of a student government is a new concept in A.S., so legislation requires thorough editing before passing and becoming part of the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“Moving the association to a research-funding academic body — it very much changes what we do,” Villarreal said. “There’s an unnatural connection in what we do here and the educational side of things.”</p>\n<p>CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major Dustin Larrazolo said Senate should override the presidential veto because the bill affects CCS students seeking grants for research.</p>\n<p>“There weren’t substantial reasons why it was vetoed, and as senators we could always put forward bills to modify,” Larrazolo said. “The space needs to be created while the momentum is here, and while the entire student population is requesting it.”</p>\n<p>Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year psychology major Niki Elyasi said although A.S. Senate unanimously supports the bill, it should take the time to perfect the legal framework of creating a governmental entity.</p>\n<p>“We realize the need for representation and for money for these students,” Elyasi said. “They are an underrepresented college. The issue is: where does that money come from and in what way is that money distributed?”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said Senate should not have the power to regulate a student’s research if CCS and CoE governments are formed as A.S. commissions.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to say what you can or can’t do,” Ninh said. “We don’t have the understanding that CCS does. I doubt all of us can access the knowledge of what it is to be a CCS student.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Louis Mariano said Senate reserves the right to overlook how money is spent, but should listen to the two colleges on how to spend grant money.</p>\n<p>“They know how to spend the money better than we spend the money, so if they recommend that things should be spent on this grant, then yeah I would go with them,” Mariano said. “I don’t believe the senate should not strike minutes, since we are the overseers.</p>\n<p>We look at the money to make sure that the money is spent appropriately.”</p>\n<p>The motions to override the presidential vetoes on “A Bill to Establish A.S. Commissions for the CCS Student Council and CoE Student Council” and “A Bill to Redefine the A.S.

Senate Monday, opening an on-campus senator positon.</p>\n<p>Wright is currently studying abroad at Sotheby’s Institute of Art in London and has been participating in Senate through a proxy, second-year computer science and statistics double major Tarush Mohanti. Although she has resigned as senator, Wright plans to continue as UC Student Association Alumni Relations Officer, the Michael D. Young intern to the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and a member of the Working Group for the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault.</p>\n<p>Wright said the limits on the role she could play as senator while studying abroad contributed to her resignation.</p>\n<p>“Within my own projects, Tarush was coordinating with me so I could work on most of them remotely,” Wright said. “But I found out that I was not going to be allowed to submit legislation through him while I am abroad, essentially preventing me from doing any work while I’m away and negating all the work we had been doing, which I felt was unfair to the student body.”</p>\n<p>Wright said A.S operates as a “huge bureaucracy” whose policies inhibit with progresses.</p>\n<p>“All of its rules and regulations, instead of making it easier to facilitate work, have fostered a system of inefficiency,” Wright said.</p>\n<p>According to Wright, Senate members demonstrated patterns of behavior that “perpetuate discrimination, pre-conceived bias and downright hostility.”</p>\n<p>“Personally, I’ve consistently had my motives questioned, particularly from people who assumed I made my relationship choices based on my professional aspirations,” Wright said. “So often mental health and well-being of students is disregarded, which is horrible to see from an organization that promotes mental health reform and de-stigmatization.”</p>\n<p>Wright said A.S.’s “competitive environment” was one reason she chose to resign.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is filled with so many amazing and passionate people with the best of intentions,” Wright said. “However, in executing projects, many people — not all, but many — often can become territorial over their projects both to retain control over it but also to garner the most credit.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and political science double major and on-campus senator Nawar Nemeh said he agrees the Senate environment is one of unproductive competition.</p>\n<p>“Her resignation saddens me deeply but I understand it,” Nemeh said. “There’s a lot of cynicism about the intentions of others. I fear that this makes it harder for some people to get their reforms through.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he wants to solve the issues that drove Wright to resign by collaborating with other senators and being accessible to campus organizations.<br>\n“I am going to start reaching out to more senators I don’t usually work with and be a resource for people who need it,” Nemeh said.<br>\nWright said her “proudest accomplishments” at UCSB happened before her term as senator.</p>\n<p>“I’ve gotten UCSB Campus Regulation changed to be fairer to [sexual assault] survivors, I’ve garnered over a thousand signatures for a petition to the Regents’ requesting additional funding for consent programs and helped organize over a dozen lobby visits,” Wright said. “I found Senate a more difficult environment to complete my projects in.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/","id":3985,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[3984,3983,3982],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"route":"/categories/news/student-gov","highestPage":4}},"__N_SSG":true}
