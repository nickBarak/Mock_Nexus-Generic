A.S. is condemning these companies due to their involvement with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Both pieces of legislature, drafted by Off-Campus Senators Rafael Cornejo and Christian Ornelas, were student-sponsored by Rachel Andrews, Dylan Kupsh and A.S. President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>To attain “sanctuary status,” the school needs to meet several stipulations outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>Refusing to share information with immigration enforcement agencies, investing in “faculty and staff training to support undocumented students,” protecting students and faculty from deportation, barring I.C.E. from all UCSB-owned property and blocking “campus security” from asking about an “individual’s immigration status” all contribute to the definition of “sanctuary status,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The resolution calls for all current A.S. executive offices to “release a statement in support of the Undocumented community &amp; International Community at UCSB,” and for the A.S. Executive Director to “release a statement in support of UCSB as a ‘Sanctuary Campus.’”</p>\n<p>Ornelas also cited the Senate’s history of support for undocumented students by passing a resolution that supported voter rights for undocumented residents in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“This Senate and past Senates have history of supporting the undocumented community and it would be good to continue that. Earlier this year, we passed something about voter rights for undocumented folks in I.V. and it’s good to just do something on campus,” Ornelas said.</p>\n<p>Rachel Andrews, a second-year biopsychology major, spoke about the resolution during public forum. Andrews said undocumented students often fear being “separate from us, as if they’re not your neighbor or the person you’re sitting next to in class.”</p>\n<p>The bill carries similar sentiments to the resolution, with the exception that it is tailored specifically to UCSB-invested companies, stating that “Associated Students shall not provide assistance or resources” and will prohibit any presence of these companies in A.S. “physical space[s]” without the proper documentation to enter them.</p>\n<p>Also tacked onto the bill: “ASUCSB will no longer use e-verify in its practices in order to protect the identities of its undocumented members.” E-verify is a “web-based system that allows enrolled employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States,” according to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.e-verify.gov/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>While addressing the Senate, Kopel noted that she asked UC President Janet Napolitano if she plans to make UCSB a sanctuary campus. According to Kopel, Napolitano ultimately said she would not, citing fears that it would make UCSB a target if it were to assume the label of a “Sanctuary Campus.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Senate, taking 12 of the 23 seats on the table. The Isla Vista Party won 10 seats, while the last seat went to engineering candidate Diana Reyes Carrillo, who ran independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be no College of Creative Studies (CCS) senator and no fifth on-campus senator in the 70th Senate due to a shortage of candidates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full list of senator-elects can be viewed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/live-a-s-election-results-2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A notable victory from tonight’s election was that of College of Letters &amp; Science Senator-elect Justice Dumlao. He previously lost twice in A.S. elections – once as an External Vice President for Local Affairs candidate in 2016-2017 and again in the 2017-2018 presidential race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 32.34% of the undergraduate student body voted in this year’s election, compared to 39.7% of last year. According to the A.S. Elections Board, 6,980 students undergraduate students voted in this year’s election, as opposed to the 8,233 who voted in the 2017-2018 election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-03/a-s-elections-sees-increase-in-voter-turnout/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first year since 2015</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that voter turnout has dropped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, a third-year political science major, is UCSB’s first female Asian-American president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am just so grateful to actually represent the community, my community, the Asian American community,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am so blessed that I have so much support… The night went really well and I am really proud of everyone that was able to win and feel the experience of running. I am very proud of Zion running too, we are both women of color and I am very proud… for what we both did. I am excited to do a lot of good work and [make] tangible change.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race between External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) candidates Christian Ornelas and Matthew Griffin came the closest. With 3,012 votes, Ornelas narrowly defeated Griffin, who earned 2,915, by a margin of 97 votes – a mere 1.6%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to A.S. Legal Code, “A recount shall be given whenever the difference between the Candidates is two percent (2%) or less of the votes cast for the office; or whenever evidence of an erroneous count is shown and called to the attention of the Elections Board Chairperson or the Senate within one (1) week (seven (7) days) after the vote has been announced.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Board did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding a potential recount. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know that I have really big shoes to fill, so I’m excited to start working with Jeike, start having our transition meetings, just to really make sure that I can live up to all the work that she’s done because she’s done a lot for this campus,” Ornelas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Vice President-elect Alli Adam ran unopposed after her would-be opponent, Yash Nagpal, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/isla-vista-party-will-not-run-internal-vice-president-candidate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dropped out of the race</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during Week 1 of Spring Quarter, citing health concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Associated Students has a bright future for 2019-2020, and that’s all I have to say,” Adam, a third-year political science major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrew Nguyen was also unopposed in his race for Student Advocate General. Nguyen ran for an off-campus Senate seat with Campus United during the 2017-2018 school year and served on the 69th Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United External Vice President for Statewide Affairs-elect Daevionne Beasley defeated Isla Vista Party candidate Alexandra Leal Silva by a margin of 513 votes. Beasley, a second-year sociology major, emphasized that he wants to continue working with Leal Silva during his EVPSA term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m most excited to reach out to [Leal Silva] and see exactly what ideas she has from working in the EVPSA office these last three years … I know that she was so instrumental in keeping the office going when there was no EVPSA, I really need her input and insight,” Beasley said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We reached out to each other before and we said that no matter the results, we’d work with each other and I hope that continues and that the sentiment was real, and I can’t wait to see where both of our ideas will take us forward.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All fee reaffirmations passed, and the sole new fee on the ballot – a fee for the Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) – also passed with 64.93% of the vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with most A.S. elections, the days leading up to the final results were filled with contentious jabs between the two parties, but it was the day of elections when A.S.

Simren Verma / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Steinhorn, a third-year communication major, and Adri Davies, a third-year political science major, have been close friends since their freshman year when they were matched as roommates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two got the idea to start a podcast about the lack of knowledge students have about A.S. during a class they took together last quarter: Writing for Public Discourse (105PD), an upper-division writing class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final project in the class was to put together an advocacy campaign, and Steinhorn and Davies decided to create a 30-minute podcast titled “Apathy Unveiled.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, this first episode of “Apathy Unveiled” is the only podcast the two have created but they plan to make more about A.S. and even expand to new topics, such as UCSB’s Greek system and national politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t know a lot of the stuff that we ended up reporting on and covering until we started doing the research,” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I think a lot of it also stemmed from our own curiosity about A.S. elections and how A.S. works.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the beginning of the podcast, Steinhorn spoke to how UCSB students seem to care about national politics, but not A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has one of the highest student voting populations out of public universities,” Steinhorn said. “But somehow, we have failed… to even get half the student body to vote in any recent [A.S.] elections.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Steinhorn’s and Davies’ perspectives differ from that of current A.S. elected officials and candidates. Many students – including those currently running in the Spring Quarter 2019 elections – emphasize that the student body is unaware of A.S.’s budget due to a lack of transparency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies disagree. They find the root of the problem to be apathetic students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Steinhorn and Davies began researching for the podcast, they decided to look into A.S.’s level of transparency for themselves and ended up finding A.S.’s budget almost immediately, Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The issue is not that we don’t have information or that it’s not transparent,” Davies said in the podcast. “You Google UCSB A.S. budget and it’s like the second link.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because students have no idea what’s going on, students that do run for positions know that they can get away with whatever they want basically.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies then went on in the podcast to discuss the disqualification of former External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA)-elect Mayela Morales and the subsequently vacant EVPSA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Associated Students has tried to elect a new representative, and we have continually not been able to get enough student voters to allow that representative into their position,” Steinhorn said in the podcast, referring to the failed A.S. special elections held this past school year in an attempt to elect an EVPSA.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn re-emphasized that she believes the reason behind the vacant EVPSA position is largely due to apathetic students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies spent a bulk of the podcast, however, arguing that many students do not know the reality of how much money A.S. controls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easy to attribute inaction to the lack of transparency, but then when we found that there was a lot of transparency… it’s like, okay then, what is the actual problem?” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “That kind of led us to talking to the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davies clarified that she believes it is hard to understand what happens inside of A.S. and what exactly is on A.S. elected officials’ agendas, noting that it is the budget and the financial information that she thinks is transparent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Steinhorn and Davies asked UCSB students what they knew about A.S. and how much money they thought the A.S. budget was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student guessed $20,000, and another guessed $500,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of them missed the mark by a longshot. Steinhorn and Davies told each student they interviewed that A.S.’s budget for this school year was $13.8 million. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students responded with gasps, one exclaimed “Oh my god!” and one even said, “For what? What do they do?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies also asked the students if they knew how much each student individually pays A.S. with their fees and asked the students if they knew that the A.S. executive elected officials get most of their tuition paid through honoraria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with interviewing students not involved in A.S., they also interviewed an A.S. insider, who wanted to remain anonymous, and asked the insider to explain what exactly A.S. is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I’ve noticed on this campus is there is a small group of people who are politically engaged, and they end up determining a lot of student-wide issues… that not necessarily a majority of students would want,” the A.S. insider said during the podcast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the theme of apathy, Steinhorn and Davies stressed that they believe there is an issue of accessibility to A.S. Although they think that students can do more, they also believe that A.S. can do more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people probably view university government as more of a club than a body that actually makes decisions,” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “It’s kind of like this selective group. It seems, at least from the outside, hard to break in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davies then joined in on expressing her frustration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How are these people being picked?

Senate resolutions actually affect university policy?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no direct percentage of Senate resolutions that affect university policy. There are several different types of bills/resolutions that the Senate passes, but the main two are positional and directional resolutions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positional bill/resolution is one that “endorses, sponsors, or supports a group’s actions or events.” Positional resolutions require a two thirds vote. For example, a positional resolution passed this past year was one in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/a-s-passes-three-resolutions-in-support-of-afscme-strike-one-which-suspends-a-s-operations-in-solidarity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support of the AFSCME strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A directional bill/resolution is one that “directs members of A.S. Personnel, Boards, Committees and/or the Senate to specific duties.” A directional resolution requires a 50% plus 1 vote – in the case of the 69th Senate, 13 votes. One example of a directional resolution passed by the Senate during this past year is “The King’s A+ For Excellence Awards,” </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/new-resolution-keeps-former-a-s-advisor-kings-legacy-alive/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which awards five students each a $500 grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further details about the types of bills and resolutions that the Senate can pass begins on page 313 of Legal Code under the Policy 6: Main Motions section in the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do my student fees go?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of the 2018-2019 school year, students pay $631.83 in A.S. and Graduate Student Association (GSA) fees and $1,188.87 in lock-in fees – overall, paying $1,820.70 in student fees each school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student fees given to A.S. fund Arts &amp; Lectures, the Child Care Center, Campus Learning Assistive Services (C.L.A.S.), Disabled Student Services, the Events Center, intramural sports, the Multi-Cultural Center, the Office of Student Life, Recreational Sports, the Coastal Fund, Student Health and the University Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students fees designated as lock-in fees include Arts &amp; Lectures, bike path maintenance, a second C.L.A.S. fee, Career Services, C.A.P.S., E.O.P., Event Center, the Green Initiative</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fund (TGIF)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Health &amp; Wellness, a second MCC fee, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the Recreation Center among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fees fall under both of these categories, such as two separate MCC fees and two C.L.A.S. fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact breakdown of fees for the 2018-2019 school year can be found <a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/2018-19cbf.pdf?sfvrsn=6518aa46_2\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>How were both parties founded?

The other presidential candidate, Zion Solomon, said during the presidential candidate forum that they would like to keep student fees the same, emphasizing the importance of the fees for creating programs that benefit students. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is the minimum voting percentage threshold needed to win if a candidate is unopposed?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated in A.S. Legal Code, at least 20% of all eligible undergraduate students must vote in the election for it to be valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For individual candidates, Elections Board uses the Droop Quota to calculate the minimum number of voters needed for a candidate to be elected. The formula is as follows: Votes Needed = (Valid Votes Cast / Number of Seats + 1) + 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further information about the quota can be found on page 298 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is a special election? Is this a special election?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not a special election. A special election can happen when a position within the executive offices – such as the president, EVPLA, EVPSA, IVP or S.A.G. – becomes vacant. Special election rules are controlled by Elections Board. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, there have been two special elections: the first in Fall Quarter 2018 and the second in Winter Quarter 2019. Both elections attempted to fulfill the vacant EVPSA position; during both, less than the minimum required number of students voted, invaliding the results. </span></p>\n<p><b>Who is advising elections? Who are members of the committee in charge of elections? Do we get to see the minutes?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Elections Board is in charge of the elections. There are seven members of the board, and they are advised by Kendra Sandoval and Ruth Garcia Guevara. Election Board minutes are not open to the public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are on Elections Board cannot run for any senatorial or executive position or be a representative for any campus political party. </span></p>\n<p><b>Is results night still in the UCen?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Results night will happen in the UCen’s Hub at 7 p.m. on Thursday, April 25. </span></p>\n<p><b>What endorsements besides the </b><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b> can candidates get? Is there a list? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is not an explicit list of who can endorse, but rather only a list of who cannot endorse candidates. As stated in Legal Code, all A.S. entities cannot endorse candidates and parties. Further details about endorsements can be found on page 283 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 22, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why doesn’t A.S. have greater authority over the Isla Vista area?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. has representation within I.V. through the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) position, held by third-year global studies major Jeike Meijer. The EVPLA can advocate on behalf of UCSB students’ needs in I.V., but they cannot make direct changes to laws; instead, they work with governmental bodies that make those decisions, such as the I.V. Recreation and Parks District and the I.V. Community Service District, to make change within the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB owns property in I.V., but cannot control or make decisions over I.V. as a whole because, by nature, the two are separate. UCSB is a university; I.V. is an unincorporated district – and home to families, private businesses and more, not just students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because UCSB and I.V.’s histories are so intertwined, there are ways in which the university can directly or indirectly exert influence over what happens in I.V. For example, the university has a representative on the I.V. CSD, who serves as a coordinator between the two entities. Additionally, UCSB gives a $200,000 grant to the district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates for this year’s EVPLA election are third-year political science Matthew Griffin and third-year environmental studies major Christian Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><b>What kind of compensation do A.S. members receive?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. executive director and other full-time staff members within A.S. receive yearly salaries. For example, the current A.S. executive director, Marisela Marquez, received $110,911 for the 2017 fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Executives receive $3,000 per quarter, while A.S. senators receive $400 dollars per quarter for serving on the Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both face different sets of rules and requirements, which can be found in A.S. legal code. </span></p>\n<p><b>Does the Daily Nexus have beef with the A.S. Senate? What’s up with always criticizing their shortcomings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not “have beef” with the A.S. Senate. Just as with any other relationship between reporters and the government officials they cover, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports on both the Senate’s shortfalls and its successes. As a campus newspaper, it is important that we hold A.S. accountable because, after all, the same people who read the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are the ones giving A.S. their money to spend. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the ideological differences between CU and I.V. party?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During our endorsement interviews, we asked each candidate running for an executive position about the difference between Campus United and the Isla Vista Party, and they all gave various vague answers. Some candidates said their party thinks outside of the box, while others said their party was like a family to them. The executive candidates also emphasized that they would not speak about the opposing party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United has a website that includes information about its platform: </span><a href=\"https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Party has a Facebook page that is regularly updated. However, there aren’t many details on the page regarding the party’s platform and ideologies: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IslaVistaParty/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.facebook.com/IslaVistaParty/</span></a></p>\n<p><b>Where can I view a list of candidates?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A list of all candidates can be seen on our website <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the programs that come from my student fees?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides providing Senate with a budget to spend throughout the year, your student fees fund a variety of different programs across campus. For example, the A.S. Program Borard is funded by student fees, as well as the Bike Shop, Queer Commission, Food Bank and many others. You can find the full list of A.S. funded entities here: </span><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 16, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why should I care?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student enrolled at UCSB pays </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.61 every quarter to Associated Students to go toward “a wide variety of operations of Associated Students that benefit the students of UCSB, the campus and the surrounding community,” as written on the A.S. Finance and Business website. This amounts to an estimated $14 million a year, as of last reported numbers. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the different A.S. positions? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. serves as an umbrella for dozens of organizations. The most well-known divisions of A.S. include the legislative branch (the A.S. Senate), the executive branch (the A.S. Executives) and the judicial branch (the A.S. Judicial Council). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the A.S. Senate, there are 25 senatorial positions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 25 senators are elected based on different constituencies; there are 12 off-campus senator seats, five on-campus senator seats, four Letters &amp; Science senator seats, one College of Engineering senator seat, one College of Creative Studies senator seat, one transfer senator seat and one university-owned off-campus senator seat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been no College of Creative Studies senator for the past school year, and no students have declared candidacy for the seat this year’s election as of press time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the executive branch, there are five A.S. executive positions: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UCSBASOP/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ivpucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">internal vice president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (IVP), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbEVPSA/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARB6ux9CZOA9eMPbLvNNLuo5kIGZGoj3jtgxwRvfm0rLaYKe9A5qbzuS2FCpyxrzSJFwR85Z0BVYmuyX\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for statewide affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPSA), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/evplaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for local affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPLA) and the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/osaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student advocate general</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (S.A.G.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EVPSA position has been vacant since Spring Quarter 2018 following the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales and the two subsequent special elections that failed to meet the voter threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The president serves as a representative of UCSB at the systemwide level and is a voice for students within the UCSB administration. They also work on projects within their own office to enhance the UCSB student experience and sit on various committees around campus. The IVP presides over the A.S. Senate, and has the power to serve as a tie-breaking vote. The EVPLA works with local government bodies, such as the I.V. Community Services District and the I.V. Recreation and Park District. The EVPSA advocates for UCSB student issues at the state and federal level. Finally, the S.A.G. heads up the Office of the Student Advocate, which provides support for students/student groups who are involved in a dispute with the university.</span></p>\n<p><b>How can you reach out to your senators and other executives?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple ways to contact your senators and executives. As of this year, the 69th senate passed a resolution that requires senators to provide their constituencies with an official Facebook page. A.S. executives also have official Facebook pages, where you will find their office hours, the location of their office hours, contact info and projects they are currently undertaking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address the entire Senate as a whole, students or community members can speak at public forum during weekly Senate meetings, which begin at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in the Flying A room of the University Center. The Senate does not hold meetings during Week 10 or finals week. </span></p>\n<p><b>When does voting begin?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting officially begins on April 22 at 8 a.m., or Monday of Week 4. It ends on April 25 at 4 p.m. The results will be announced on April 25 at a time and place to be determined. Log onto G.O.L.D. to cast your vote.</span></p>\n<p>A full version of A.S.

Like all S.A.G. candidates in the past, he is not affiliated with any party and is running as an independent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) aids students accused of violating the University Code of Student Conduct and advocates for any changes to be made for a fairer policy. The OSA is a non-partisan executive branch within UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Student Advocate General] requires a lot of compassion. It requires approaching these student cases with a level of humanity and empathy in order to best understand and listen to the people that you’re actually serving,” Nguyen said during the S.A.G. forum on Monday, which began at 1:30 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this past year, Nguyen served as an off-campus senator with the 69th Senate. However, when asked about his past involvement with the OSA, he stated he had “zero experience” in the office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a job I’ve never done before. And so that’s why I really want to be, throughout this entire year, is [be] honest with my students, with my constituents,” he said during the forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how I’m going to do this job, but [based] off my experience as an off-campus senator this year, I can tell you at the very least, I’m excited.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he plans to increase awareness and improve the image of the OSA through two ways: social media and physical presence. He noted that being active on social media platforms to spread information and establishing a physical campus presence through tabling and door-to-door operations are key to making the OSA a trustworthy, compassionate and welcoming space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said he plans to continue a project left behind by Jack Tannenbaum, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-s-a-g-jack-tannenbaum/\">the 2017-2018 Student Advocate General.</a> Tannenbaum’s project focused on a poll that would be used to collect data at the end of elections on what students are most concerned about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen wants to improve upon the poll by sending it out in the middle of the year through G.O.L.D. and carrying out door-to-door operations in order to work on initiatives earlier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also emphasized his understanding of the boundaries between confidentiality and transparency, stating that confidentiality is needed when dealing with student cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easy for people to take an oath to be confidential, but I believe that those words and those oaths only take a real shape when someone understands the impact it has on the people around them. And that’s something I believe I’ve really internalized,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said he prioritizes the safety of students.

CSD meeting on Tuesday. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The report touched on a variety of topics, focusing mainly on how to remediate I.V.’s current lighting situation, which many residents deem inadequate, according to the report. The report also covered funding, wattage increases and potential problems that could arise from the implementation of new lighting fixtures.</p>\n<p>The report, compiled by the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) Jeike Meijer, I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and Associated Students Lobby Corps proposes improvements to the existing street lighting situation.</p>\n<p>The lighting augmentation would include street light wattages from 54W L.E.D. to 130W L.E.D. along the 6600 and 6700 blocks of Pasado Road and Sueno Road, the 6500 and 6600 blocks of Picasso Road and the 6500 block of Cordoba Road, Segovia Road, El Greco Road and Cervantes Road.</p>\n<p>This change in wattage would match that of the existing wattages for Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road as well as parts of Abrego Road and Trigo Road, which already have 130W L.E.D. bulbs installed.</p>\n<p>Altogether, the report suggests increasing the wattage of 73 L.E.D. street lights in I.V. The report calculated the L.E.D. updates to cost roughly $21,900, or $300 per each L.E.D.</p>\n<p>Aside from detailing fixed costs, the report also noted that ongoing costs would be “funded though CSA 31’s (County Service Area 31) benefit and property tax revenue,” which has a  surplus of approximately $7,500, according to the report.</p>\n<p>There are also recommendations to replace the remaining 38 High Pressure Sodium Vapour (HPSV) street lights with L.E.D.s, due to their lack of efficiency and shorter lifespans, excluding HPSV lights on El Embarcadero and Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>The report proposed the installation of 10 new street lights along Abrego Road, Pasado Road and Sueno Road. These street lights would be placed in areas that currently contain gaps between existing fixtures, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The construction of these new street lights would cost an estimated $90,000, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The report acknowledged concerns regarding the increase in the wattage of existing street lights. Installing new lights could potentially erode I.V.’s “natural serenity” and increase light pollution, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The EVPLA Office made an attempt to alleviate these concerns by citing the energy-efficiency of L.E.D. bulbs and their superior light distribution compared to fluorescent bulbs. L.E.D. lights contain no toxic elements such as mercury, which is commonly found in fluorescent lights, according to the report.</p>\n<p>“Mercury mostly poses a threat to the environment, specifically when fluorescent lights end up in landfill waste,” the report stated.</p>\n<p>While street lighting has been a talking point for Associated Students (A.S.) and I.V. officials for years, I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said there is still a lot of work to be done. Brandt said he hopes that I.V. residents continue to support this proposal and hopes to secure the funds and resources necessary from CSA 31 to keep the project moving forward.</p>\n<p>“There is strong support for a brighter IV and to the hundreds [of] IV residents that have made their voices heard. We will need the community’s continued input in order to make more lighting a reality,” he said in a Facebook post.</p>\n<p>Although this is the most recent attempt to call attention to street lighting deficiencies in I.V., past efforts from community members have also attempted to address this issue, going back as far as 1972, according to Brandt’s Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=248625322477836\">post</a>.</p>\n<p>Students, leaders and law enforcement officials also voiced their concerns in support of upgraded lighting fixtures in testimonials from the report.</p>\n<p>Many people’s concerns about lighting deficiencies are rooted in concerns about safety in I.V., which some say would be increased with greater lighting in the area.</p>\n<p>“Often when I feel the least safe is when I am walking back to my apartment through I.V. at night, and I think adding more lighting would make me, and others, feel safer,” Sarah Allen-Sutter, fourth-year psychology major, wrote in her testimonial in the report.</p>\n<p>For now, some students, including Emily Montalvo-Telford, president of Students Against Sexual Assault, said they have to resort to other means for ensuring safety when walking through dimly lit I.V. streets at night.</p>\n<p>“I feel unsafe. I am forced to walk quickly and I have spent many walks on the phone with friends in order to experience even a small amount of security,” Montavlo-Telford wrote in the report.</p>\n<p>Lt. Juan Camarena of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office wrote in the report that he agreed that increased lighting would be a viable way to mitigate crime and increase safety.</p>\n<p>“Improved lighting means that offenders are more likely to be seen by someone who might intervene, call law enforcement, or recognize the offender,” Camarena wrote.</p>\n<p>The report also included a survey conducted by the EVPLA office which asked I.V. residents if money designated for improving I.V. should be spent expanding either sidewalks or lighting. Lighting was overwhelmingly favored, garnering 90.9 percent of the 187 responses.</p>\n<p>The report proposed several ways to gauge feedback from the community about lighting issues and then suggested specific improvements for lighting expansion and renovation.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD, in collaboration with A.S., would co-host a Lighting Expansion Forum, which would give residents the opportunity to review the proposal and provide input.</p>\n<p>Canvassing would also be carried out door-to-door, with volunteers giving information to residents about proposed changes and the lighting expansion forum for the public.</p>\n<p>A full version of the report can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Preliminary-Lighting-Expansion-Plan.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Preliminary-Lighting-Expansion-Plan.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object><br>\n<a class=\"pdflink\" style=\"display: none;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Preliminary-Lighting-Expansion-Plan.pdf\">Download Document</a></p>\n<p><em>Updated [2:42 p.m.] </em></p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams and Sean Crommelin can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 14, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Shut it down!” <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recently elected 69th A.S. Senate abruptly ended its inaugural meeting after a group of about 60 people stormed the Hub screaming, “Shut it down!” in what the group called an act of “civil disobedience.” The students stomped onto the stage and grabbed microphones away from the sitting senators, who had hastily begun their meeting when 11 senators and Internal Vice President-Elect Steven Ho failed to show up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In similar fashion, 15 senators and proxies didn’t show up to the final 68th Senate meeting earlier that evening. Those who boycotted the meeting did so in an apparent protest of the 12 who </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">didn’t return to last week’s meeting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the dust settled, it was another instance — the fifth time in six years — in which divestment failed to pass at UC Santa Barbara, which remains the only undergraduate UC campus not to have passed the resolution.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The divestment resolution calls for the UC to withdraw investments from companies that profit from alleged human rights violations in Israel and Palestine. While proponents cite violence in the region as a reason to divest, opponents, largely from the Jewish community, believe the resolution singles out Israel and draws its contents from the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which they deem to be anti-Semitic.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wednesday evening was intended to include both the final meeting of the 68th Senate and the first session of the 69th, along with the swearing-in of the elected A.S. executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final meeting of the 68th was supposed to pick up right where it left off — at the conclusion of last week’s meeting, where 12 senators and proxies didn’t return from a recess because the other 13 wouldn’t approve the agenda. The Senate was split over how to categorize the resolution, a distinction that would have significantly altered the necessary voting threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to accept the agenda, to discuss this issue,” said Off-Campus Senator Kristen Armellini. “To say that we didn’t want to discuss it is false.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83282\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83282\" data-attachment-id=\"83282\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/judicial-council-seats-will-be-unfilled-until-at-least-week-9/img_3217/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3217\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83282 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83282\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Outgoing A.S.

But only 10 senators were present, leading Internal Vice President Jasmine Sandhu to adjourn the meeting and officially announce that the 68th A.S. Senate’s term was complete. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish we could’ve ended this like we should’ve,” Transfer Senator Kian Maalizadeh said after the meeting was adjourned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 69th A.S. Senate meeting was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m., but IVP-Elect Ho and 11 senators were not present for the first forty minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho, a senator this year, had already communicated he would be late to the 68th senate meeting because his pass time for choosing fall quarter classes was scheduled for 6:30 p.m., according to a statement he sent to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marisela Marquez, A.S. executive director, texted Ho that all business from the 68th senate would be sent to the 69th senate, Ho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After this, I got incredibly overwhelmed and had an intense anxiety attack and could not even breathe because that would mean I would have to oversee a bunch of legislation along with elections results,” the statement read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After waiting for over 20 minutes, Sandhu swore in the 13 senators who were present. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without Ho sworn in as the Senate chair, Marquez told the senators they had the authority to elect pro-tempores to run the meeting. The senators rapidly chose Mordi Shadpour to be the first pro-tempore and Lea Toubian as the second pro-tempore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the only reason why they were chosen is because… they were the only two people that applied for that position that were the senators that were sitting there,” said Off-Campus Senator Carla Cernat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shadpour and Toubian then took the lead, directing the 69th Senate as they ratified the 2018 A.S. Elections results and approved Ali Suebert, the current A.S. attorney general, to serve another year-long term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Shadpour attempted to lead the meeting, outgoing A.S. representatives, including IVP Sandhu, stood in front of the stage, mouthing directions to the new senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incoming A.S. President Brooke Kopel was the only executive candidate to be sworn in after elections results were ratified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho found out through a text message from fellow Senator Andrea Reyes that the 69th senate had appointed pro-tempores in his absence, according to his statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This angered me because I chose my pro-temps based who I see would work best with me and be the best assets to the office and will help me fulfill my role as the presiding officer of senate,” he wrote. “I was literally sitting in the corner trying to breath while all of this was happening. I think it was really disrespectful for the senate to do all of that and take advantage of the state I was in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho stood in the Hub as the 11 senators absent at the start of the meeting walked in at approximately 8:40 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sandhu, outgoing senators Sophia Dycaico and Grayson Hernandez and outgoing Student Advocate General Jack Tannenbaum could be seen urging the 69th Senate to speed up the process of passing the motions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once all the senators were seated, Marquez took to the microphone to request that the senators who were already sworn in call for a recess to allow their peers to be officially sworn in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the senators could consider the motion, chants of “Shut it down! Shut it down!” were heard coming from the second floor of the University Center. Approximately 60 students streamed down the stairs, marching toward and onto the stage that the Senate was occupying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newly sworn-in senators hastily adjourned the meeting as the crowd of chanting protesters stepped onstage, grabbing microphones and shouting. Many senators left the Hub altogether before the chants died down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a third-year Global Studies major, introduced the group of protesters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just to let you know, this is an act of civil disobedience,” he said. “We are having a civil disobedience because we think that what’s happening now is illegitimate and unfair.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao had argued as a senate proxy during last week’s meeting that the divestment resolution was directional, holding firm in his stance even after the Senate voted to uphold Sandhu’s decision to alter the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you are upset with what is happening, you now share our frustration with last week,” Dumlao said. “So, if you are sharing that frustration, let’s reflect on that and talk about that another time, but for right now, we are going to gather in our community and I suggest you guys [gather] in your community as well,” Dumlao said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83280\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83280\" data-attachment-id=\"83280\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/divestment-vote-cancelled-69th-senate-meeting-shut-down-by-civil-disobedience/img_3206/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3206\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83280 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83280\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Internal Vice President Jasmine Sandhu swore in the 13 senators initially present at the meeting. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Dumlao’s introduction, a young woman donning a bandana over her face stepped to the front. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am a Palestinian, and I have to hide my fucking face in front of all of you for the sake of my family,” she said, as Dumlao and a neighboring person rested their hands on her shoulders.

After speaking to the UCSB Legal Resource Center, he said he now knows both IDs lacked the necessary information required by law to sell alcohol and claims this is why there was a disparity of treatment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum, various students went up to speak about the incident, including Student Advocate General Jack Tannenbaum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the right of any minority to define what hate against them is,” Tannenbaum said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evan Quash, newly-appointed deputy chief of staff for the office of the A.S. president, said it was “problematic” for Senator Yang to say that the resolution is “crying discrimination.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is a commonly used tactic used to marginalized the voice of minority communities,” Quash said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year mathematics major AnaSophia Eiseman told the Senate they should use their power to condemn the Giovanni’s staff’s actions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is your real power: your budget,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update 6/8/17: This article has been updated to reflect the students’ undocumented status to further specify the reason for shortening their names.

She said despite being “tough” and “blunt,” her emotional involvement in many issues guided her in the advocacy for students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“When I was running, my goal was to be the person that listened, and I actually feel like I did that,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her term, Ampaw communicated with other students who did not always share her</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I was definitely forced to shut up a lot, [and] I was forced to listen,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Ampaw, her biggest accomplishment was “opening the space” of the S.A.G. to women of color.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As the first black woman in the position, I didn’t realize how big of an impact that would be and how I would be able to be a strong voice for those communities and the diaspora,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I know I could have been a much stronger voice, and I would say that’s one of my biggest regrets, but I feel like I was able to pave a way,” she added.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">When running for the position, Ampaw’s platform included increasing student awareness of the A.S. budget and creating a counselor in OSA for students accused of plagiarism.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said while she was unable to push A.S. budget transparency as much as she had wanted, she did improve the visibility of OSA finances.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Students have been able to come to me and ask me what I am doing with my money, and I am able to tell them very transparently and honestly,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said her plan to create a counselor for students accused of plagiarism was ultimately carried out by the Office of Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said prior to starting her term as S.A.G., she thought she would be “fighting alone” on behalf of students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I thought it was going to be me against A.S.,” Ampaw said. “Sometimes it was definitely me versus A.S. … but in a lot of moments, I realized that my staff had my back.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw’s staff included Catt Phan, her deputy chief of staff and a third-year global studies major. Phan said she loved working with Ampaw because she “never [lost] humor and resilience and compassion.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I have had a lot of faith in Josephine,” Phan said, “not only as a person but as someone who is in an exec position for the student government. Josephine just wants to serve the students.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Phan, the large OSA staff was “a lot to handle,” and it was oftentimes difficult to get the entire staff together for meetings. Phan said, however, the OSA office is “very sensitive” due to the types of student cases it addresses, and believes Ampaw was an experienced and qualified person to serve as S.A.G.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said she has personally changed throughout her term as S.A.G., having become more of an introvert and now finding less solace being with other people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I used to find so much rest from being around other people, but since being in this office, I find so much peace in being alone,” Ampaw said. “I thought I’d be a lot better being around other people.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said her term as S.A.G. has inspired her to become a social worker in the future. Additionally, after she graduates, Ampaw will travel to Colorado for a fellowship with AmeriCorps where she will help students who struggled in traditional school with their public speaking skills.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Looking toward next year, Ampaw said the next elected S.A.G. cannot be swayed by partisanship and must stay true to the nonpartisan nature of the office.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I also expect this person to have goals and to have aspirations for this office and really be able to express those to the entire association and entire campus,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said she is “really grateful” for the opportunity to have served as S.A.G. and wants to remind current A.S. candidates they hold an important place on campus.</p>\n<p>“For the people who are running, I would just want to say to them that the work is hard, but the work is totally worth it in the end,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77400\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77400\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/","id":3957,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3956,3955,3954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: External Vice President of Student Affairs Neha Nayak","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-05-01-at-2.14.49-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-05-01-at-2.14.49-PM.png?resize=536%2C539&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus has compiled profiles of our current elected officials to reflect on their past year in office.

Looking back on their campaign platforms, we asked our elected officials to tell us about their successes and shortfalls throughout their terms in office.</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Only months after taking office, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) Neha Nayak and her office were hit with a massive “curveball”: President Trump’s election.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It changed the course of how my office and UCSA and USSA wanted to steer our general goals,” Nayak said. “Essentially, now it was like, ‘We have to protect our students, and we have to protect individuals on campus that are threatened by our new federal government.’”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In response to the election, Nayak prioritized students who were directly affected by taking “preemptive measures,” including lobbying with other EVPSAs to ensure that UCs become sanctuaries.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77399\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77399\" data-attachment-id=\"77399\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-external-vice-president-of-student-affairs-neha-nayak/as-nayak-candidate-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?fit=1343%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1343,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS-nayak-Candidate-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?fit=164%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?fit=672%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77399\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7-672x1024.jpg?resize=600%2C915\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"915\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?resize=672%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?resize=164%2C250&amp;ssl=1 164w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1171&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?w=1343&amp;ssl=1 1343w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77399\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">However, despite this shift, Nayak was still able to make strides in increasing mental health resources and the creation of the Federal Advocacy Program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We really wanted to have an advocacy program that in a sense doesn’t just reach out to students in A.S. but to individuals that are not necessarily involved in student government, but that have these stories that can be an interesting and compelling story for a federal legislator,” Nayak said. “So if we go to, like, a representative, a congressman, you know, having someone that personally has dealt with being a refugee is more compelling.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The program launched earlier this year. According to Deputy Chief of Staff Maya Halthore, 60-70 students applied and 40 were able to go to Washington D.C. with USSA in March to lobby for Pell Grant expansion and protection, increased financial aid and DACA protection for undocumented students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her term, Nayak also focused on mental health through Chai Talks and a S.T.E.M. mental health panel.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“In terms of Chai Talks, I think it’s important to have a space on campus where students can speak on islamophobia, parental pressure, just things South Asian students, things that are related to their communities specifically, and I think that has been something that has not been spoken of or vocally emphasized” Nayak said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also takes pride in her S.T.E.M. mental health panel, which just started this quarter. She described it as a “working group” that meets every quarter to ensure that students within S.T.E.M. programs are aware of mental health resources.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I did what I wanted to do,” Nayak said, but she still wishes she could have done more regarding tracking legislation and voter registration.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Having a lot more internal communication with other entities that are already doing voter reg. is very important, and I could have improved on that,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also said that she wished she had further increased student outreach to ensure that different students and “young student leaders” are applying to attend various conferences instead of the same people going multiple times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kristin Hsu, the EVPSA chief of staff, also believes there are things that could have been done better.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Not everyone’s perfect, and I think Neha knows she’s not perfect,” said Hsu. “I think we could have done more outreach; we could have perhaps recruited more student leaders within the office; we could have gotten more staff members in the office … I think as long as you are constantly trying and making those efforts to do that outreach and go to meetings, to advertise whatever opportunities you have, you are doing your job.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s hard, because EVPSA is such a broad scope,” Nayak said. For the future, she hopes that the next EVPSA can create an easily accessible bill tracker to make students aware of legislation that may affect them.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite the setbacks, she is leaving behind a positive legacy with her staff.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I loved working with Neha. Obviously, entering EVPSA, there were bumps in the road with all of us, but Neha consistently served as a positive force within the office, being encouraging and present,” said Halthore.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As a graduating senior, Nayak looks toward a future away from politics, likely in marketing. She said, “maybe in the way future, [she’ll] run for office, for, like, state congress, but not anytime soon, that’s for sure.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite her reluctance to go into politics, she believes her experience working within A.S. and as EVPSA will guide her in her life.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“That’s something I’ll take for the rest of my life: just the knowledge of knowing how to be involved in these different communities, help these communities on campus, attend board meetings all across the state, fly to D.C. to advocate for issues that are so important to students and are essentially the lifeline of students. That has been such a growing experience for me. I wouldn’t trade it for anything else for my senior year.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She parted with some advice for future EVPSAs:</p>\n<p>“There will be ups and downs, but learn from the failures and learn from your experiences because that’s what makes you a better elected official, and in the end, you’re there for the students. You chose to run because you wanted to help UCSB students; keep that in mind when things get hard.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Looking back on their campaign platforms, we asked our elected officials to tell us about their successes and shortfalls throughout their terms in office.</em></p>\n<p>Although elected as A.S. president in April of last year, Austin Hechler was not sworn in until late August.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">His incumbency of the office was borne out of a months-long deliberation over a bribery scandal involving UC Santa Barbara’s fraternities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Elections Board claimed soon after election night in April that the Interfraternity Council (IFC) gave “monetary incentives” to its members who voted, alleging the organization believed votes could be “bought and sold.” The board called for a revote of the entire spring ballot.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77392\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77392\" data-attachment-id=\"77392\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/as-austin-candidate-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=1400%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1400,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS-austin-Candidate-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=171%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=700%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77392\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9-700x1024.jpg?resize=600%2C878\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"878\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=700%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=171%2C250&amp;ssl=1 171w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=768%2C1123&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;ssl=1 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Former A.S. president Jimmy Villarreal, alongside the UCSB Audit and Advisory Department, launched an investigation into the claims but determined in late May that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on behalf of IFC.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler believes he might be the “shortest-term president” in A.S. history.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think we got a lot done, though,” he said in an interview on Monday. “I’m proud of it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler ran on four platform items last spring: launch an alternative transportation program for disabled students, reform campus sexual assault policy, push for the establishment of the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) and make course readers more affordable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After several months, the alternative transportation program has become what is now Gaucho Rides, a pilot program that offers disabled students free rides to and from campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler, along with former senator Jerel Constantino, proposed the program approximately two years ago when he served in A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In April 2016, the two senators reached out to Lyft, a rideshare app that allows users to hail a taxi on demand, and were able to secure a partnership with the company. A month later, A.S. Senate passed a resolution to allocate $40,000 to the alternative transportation program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Applications opened for the first time in September to enroll 20 disabled students for free Lyft rides between home and campus. Hechler’s office named the program “Gaucho Rides.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The pilot program shut down in the third week of Winter Quarter, and the <i>Nexus</i> is currently verifying the causal factors. Meanwhile, Hechler said his office is developing a “backup plan” in which students can receive rides without the use of codes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Office of the A.S. President will most likely re-launch Gaucho Rides later this week, Hechler said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> in September that, depending on how the program ran in the next two quarters, he and other advocates would consider pushing for a lock-in fee for it. This week’s A.S. Elections ballot does not include such a measure.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s next platform item — sexual assault reform — has resurfaced intermittently throughout his political career.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The issue arose in April 2015 during an A.S. candidate forum when Hechler was running for a seat on A.S. Senate. An anonymous audience member asked the candidates how they plan to address campus sexual assault, and Hechler answered in response that he intended to extend sexual assault prevention training to the Greek community.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like the Greek community is such a strong and compassionate group that will rally around anything,” he said in 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler incorporated the same policy into his platform when running for president last year, calling it “one of the bigger parts of [his] platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said on Monday that this year, he spearheaded a campaign to have fraternities and sororities learn how to prevent sexual assault through the Green Dot Bystander Intervention Program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The program was funded by Hechler’s office and solicited approximately 120 men and women from IFC and the Collegiate Panhellenic Council (CPC).</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alejandra Melgoza, who vied against Hechler in 2016, said she is yet to see Hechler involved in any of the monthly conversations with university administration concerning sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also said Hechler has not yet released a statement about Sexual Assault Awareness Month or attended any events hosted by Take Back the Night, a student group dedicated to preventing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As President, he was also unable to keep his own senators who ran on a platform of sexual assault accountable,” Melgoza said in an email. “Sexual assault is not an issue that can be put on a platform to earn political capital. It affects many students personally, including myself.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said he has often sent representatives from his office to various meetings addressing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also promised in April 2016 to lead the push in A.S. for a CSD in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He and Ashcon Minoiefar, the A.S. external vice president of local affairs, worked closely together to gather volunteers for Yes on E&amp;F, a campaign which sought to establish the CSD through Measure E and fund the CSD with a special tax through Measure F.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As it turns out, voters in November overwhelmingly approved Measure E, thus creating the CSD, but did not pass Measure F, taking away the CSD’s main funding source.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fourth and final part of Hechler’s presidential campaign platform was to provide to students the least expensive course reader materials through a partnership with A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It was, like, a long process because at first we didn’t how to do it,” he said on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s office began work on this plan early on, sending out emails en masse to every professor at the university. The emails asked that faculty primarily use A.S. Publications instead of Alternative Digital Printing, the private printing business in the UCen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">His office later opted to contact academic department heads instead. He said some departments, such as the political science and environmental studies departments, responded positively. Others did not reply at all, he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The goal at the end of the day was to create a bank through Pubs where, I guess, professors could upload their things and students wouldn’t even have to buy it. It would just be on the internet; you know, environmentally friendly,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said David Miller, the A.S. Publications staff member who died in March, told him that his office more than doubled the amount of course readers published through A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The plan to increase student use of A.S. Publications “died out,” Hechler said, after Miller passed away.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also took up a few other projects outside of his platform items, including an initiative to expand the A.S. Food Bank and a push to give priority registration to ROTC students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Breanna Jones, the A.S. Food Bank committee chair, told the <i>Nexus</i> in early April that Hechler advocated strongly to university administration for the expansion of the A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[He] really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened,” she said in April.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Senate passed a bill earlier this month to give priority registration to ROTC students, and the resolution now awaits approval from the Academic Senate. Senator Alex Giolito, who introduced the bill alongside senator Riley Hobson, said two weeks ago that Hechler “brought this all together by reaching out to ROTC students first.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This year I’ve really tried to hold the senators accountable in ways that I never thought I would have to,” Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Melgoza said she found Hechler’s platform items to be “inherently hollow” and “lacked substance,” saying he had “no personal connection to anything on his platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She added that she never viewed Hechler as “someone with conviction” when they both served on A.S. Senate, and she said her views have not changed since.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There were other senators who I definitely disagreed with at the table but I still admired their dedication to their beliefs,” Melgoza said in an email. “Hechler on the other hand was constantly passive.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Arielle Kronovet, Hechler’s chief of staff, said Hechler’s kindness can often be mistaken for passivity and that he is actually “firm to his beliefs.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“He’s serious about leaving this school a better place, and I’ve seen him doing this throughout the year,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Talia Stringfellow, the A.S. president’s deputy chief of staff, said she found Hechler to be more decisive and communicative than his predecessor Villarreal, whom she worked for as an A.S. fellow the year before.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sometimes [Villarreal] changed his mind and was not a big communicator,” she said. “Communication has been a huge, sweet [and] influential part of why I think Austin’s such a good president.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler will finish his term in the next few weeks, handing the presidency to whomever students elect Thursday night. In the meantime, Hechler said, he is applying for jobs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s funny because I bet everyone thinks, ‘Oh you have a nice title; you’re going to find a job easily.’ It’s not that easy. It’s really not,” he said. “Honestly I had no idea you had to apply to jobs so early.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler looks to receive his degree in political science in June. Wherever he ends up in the next few years, he said, he wants to continue in public service.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I really just want to give back to communities,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been so privileged to have so many great opportunities in my life, and I want to give that back to people wherever I am.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/","id":3953,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3952,3951,3950],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"route":"/categories/news/student-gov","highestPage":4}},"__N_SSG":true}
