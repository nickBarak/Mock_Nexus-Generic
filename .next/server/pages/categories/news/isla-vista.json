CSD) Board of Directors released a statement which made clear that racism has no place in the Isla Vista community, Board President Spencer Brandt said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution outlined the I.V. CSD’s goal to “[improve] the quality of life, health, and safety of our Black and brown residents” and to ensure that policing contracts promote racial equity, the resolution read. It also calls on local law enforcement to take steps to eliminate racial disparities in the criminal justice system as a whole.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 1, Black Lives Matter Santa Barbara released a </span><a href=\"https://www.juneteenthsb.com/community-news/community-demands\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">set of demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> calling on the Santa Barbara City Council to adopt a resolution condemning police brutality and declaring racism a public health emergency. The City Council passed the resolution soon after, and the I.V. CSD followed suit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the resolution did not outline specific measures to take towards the outlined goals, I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman proposed </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yI06FdJ4fav87g7UrBRss8ASB0FuT21NIHmhCEP61rE/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amendments</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the resolution that documented a number of instances of police brutality throughout the country, instances of riots and over-policing in I.V. and calls to limit the use of force by police, among other actions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The big problem is that people come to us and they say, ‘Black Lives Matter,’ and we say we agree and then do we do anything?” Freeman explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And so what are we going to do?” he asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to concretely address the issues raised, the I.V. CSD also passed a working group to create an I.V. action plan and to consider Freeman’s proposals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a working group set up that is going to be researching solutions, collaborating with the Black community and other stakeholders in our community to present an action plan or tangible things when it comes to making much-needed reforms to the law enforcement system,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the following I.V. CSD meeting on June 23, the board presented a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVQo0_wvfurPIK0fOGKKUrbnWMBWeM74N7UVXB2DE8Y/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the working group’s actions thus far. The report centered around research on alternative methods of response to crisis calls in I.V., as opposed to the usual police response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the programs cited was the </span><a href=\"https://whitebirdclinic.org/services/cahoots/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CAHOOTS</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">program used in Eugene, Oregon — the location of the University of Oregon — in which a medic and a crisis worker with mental health training respond to crisis calls, including housing issues, non-emergency medical situations and substance abuse, among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The working group also looked into the possibility of a sobering center in I.V. as an alternative to jail time for alcohol-related offenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How come the only tool that we have to deal with some of these problems in our community, whether its cause is related to homelessness [or] mental health, are responded to by law enforcement officers? Do we really need armed officers responding to calls like that? Do we really need armed officers responding to noise complaint calls? I don’t think so,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those calls can be responded to by people who are more of a social worker or mediator type,” he continued. “The goal of providing mental health services, especially for those who are in mental health crisis, is much more important than trying to come in with the badge and the gun.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD also passed a 60-day extension for the negotiation of the interpersonal violence investigator contract during its June 23 meeting. In the resolution condemning police brutality, the board aims to “ensure that policing services contracted for by the District are conducted in a manner that promotes racial justice and equity.” The extension would serve to grant the extra time to account for any changes, according to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt also emphasized reaching out to various stakeholders — centered around the voices of Black people and other people of color — in the community as the process of policy change continues. The working group is also presenting reports to the Isla Vista Community Network, an organization with a number of representatives from around the I.V. community, to gain more feedback for projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really going to require the community to really be behind some of these reforms to make them actually happen. We need to keep the community pressure up on our public safety and justice system to change because that’s the only way true change is going to happen,” Brandt said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

For those who are stuck in quarantine, the struggle of food shopping only magnifies, Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faced with the puzzle of supplying community members with food while also keeping them safe amidst a pandemic, Cohen said the co-op sidestepped potential health hazards by </span><a href=\"https://islavistafoodcoop.storebyweb.com/s/1000-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doing the shopping</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for its customers through an online order system while working with food distributors to keep products on the shelves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She described the last few months of keeping the co-op afloat as “a profound journey of dismantling, reestablishing, recalibrating, reinculturating, repurposing and recentering.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As much as Costco might’ve been easy or useful to deal with or Sprouts was a resource before, they’re not resources now. Corporate grocery could not help UCSB in [its] moment of need,” she continued. “I bet you don’t realize the power of having a community grocer right in your back pocket.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest advantages of running the co-op, as opposed to a corporate grocery store, is its lack of a corporate hierarchy, Cohen explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The uniqueness of being a small business at this time is very powerful,” she said, referring to the co-op’s flexibility in rolling out new rules and policies instantly without the need for higher-up approval. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-op leveraged this advantage in March, when out-of-towners flocked to the store after wiping clean the nearby Costco and Sprouts, Cohen said. She immediately implemented mask-wearing policies and purchase limits to keep a lid on the panic buying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of a sudden, the co-op was descended upon by non-students who are buying hundreds of dollars worth of stuff at one time when we’re used to, like, a $10, $15 shopping basket,” Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Overnight, the co-op was discovered as this off-the-beaten-path treasure as all these supermarkets have these crazy lines and people are freaking out, and then suddenly people are shopping at the co-op,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the panic buying, Cohen said the loss of a third of her workforce — the part-time </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students who left I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ride out the pandemic at home — was another symptom of the pandemic’s toll on the co-op. But her remaining staff, despite being “worked to the bone,” stepped up to meet the demand, she said; at its peak, sales at the co-op were up nearly 70%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To offset the burden of working during the pandemic, Cohen said the co-op has been paying all employees hazard pay — including $2-per-hour raises and cash bonuses — since March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the co-op’s new safety protocols include new rules for sick leave, a mask-wearing policy for workers and customers, cleaning guidelines and performing administrative work remotely, Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cohen also said she is grateful for the </span><a href=\"https://davisfood.coop/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis Food Co-op</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the I.V. Food co-op’s sister store up north, for sharing its pandemic response plan and giving the co-op an adaptable blueprint for future plans and protocols, and for Churchill, whose sanitizer orders sounded the alarm about the necessity of preparing the co-op for the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cohen said these efforts provided an added layer of security to the store by making customers and workers feel safe while inside the food co-op. But when it comes to the food supply chain, which is largely out of the hands of the co-op, some uncertainty still looms, according to Steve Snyder, the I.V. Food Co-op’s merchandising manager. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line, he said, is that the “food supply chain was robust until people lost their minds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the third week of March, the panic buying was so intense that customers were buying items straight off the delivery truck before they even hit the shelves, Snyder said. This briefly forced the co-op to put in orders to its food distributors that were twice its normal size, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So the panic buying, the hoarding, the desperate desire to get it before your neighbor gets it — that’s what broke the food supply chain. When [they] recommended that people remain calm, that is what we all should have done,” Snyder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There would be toilet paper on shelves if every person in North America, who could get four cases of 96-count toilet paper, didn’t go out and do that and build a fort in their garage,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snyder said there are currently a variety of holes in Southern California’s food supply chain, which is one of the largest and most impacted grocery regions in the U.S. Some of these gaps are reflected directly on the co-op’s shelves, where products such as rice, pasta, soup, toilet paper, bottled water and frozen fruits are either slowly returning in quantity or still out of stock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the food co-op is connected directly to growers around the state, Snyder said the quantity of some items, mainly produce, is not a concern. But when it comes to sourcing products from manufacturers and vendors — adding more layers to the supply chain — availability becomes more of an issue, Snyder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some warehouses used by </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-06-09/coronavirus-pandemic-food-supply\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manufacturers and vendors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to store products have bled dry from panic buying, Snyder said. This means that “they’ve either sold through everything and they have to wait for the 2020 harvest to begin reproducing for staples … or they haven’t sold through everything but they’re allotting shipments to specific warehouses to make sure that everybody gets a chance,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judging from his experiences during the coronavirus pandemic, Snyder said he’d down boil what he learned into two takeaways for the future: “Try to figure out how to not get caught off guard” and “put quantity limits in place sooner.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wish that people would recognize that everyone should have access to food. And you’re not helping anyone, including yourself, if you’re buying a year’s or more supply of stuff,” he said. “That’s going to sit in your garage and eventually go stale, and then you’re going to send it to the landfill.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Cohen, the pandemic may have been full of learning experiences, but it was also a catalyst for growth. She recalled being wary of starting Co-op Curbside, the co-op’s grocery delivery service, but grew to appreciate the convenience — and necessity — of having such a service after seeing how it unified community members during a time of need. Now, she says, the co-op has immortalized the service and she can’t see the store without it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I always had said, ‘I think doing home delivery is ridiculous. The co-op is place-based and people need to come to the store; it’s about the experience,’” she said. “And, of course, I’ve been proven wrong.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same can also be said for hazard pay, Cohen said. Now, $15 per hour is the new normal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back at the strenuous months of March, April and May, Cohen said the pandemic has been a bumpy road for the co-op, in part because the store lost some of its identity in the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a place that prides itself on helping customers “feel safe and be seen,” Cohen said closing down the outdoor patio, canceling upcoming workshops and rolling out safety protocols made it all the more difficult to do that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But through it all, the community response has been “incredible,” Cohen said, pointing to moments of appreciation from new and long-term customers who saw the value in the co-op’s grocery delivery service and cleaning protocols and found comfort knowing that there would always be food on the shelves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for a small business with a generational stake in I.V. and a community of fervent supporters, Cohen is confident that the “new normal” will make the co-op stronger than ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you haven’t lived and loved Isla Vista and gone through your part of your life here, you will never know the magnitude of this community,” she said. “One of Isla Vista’s most magnificent attributes is that it is a community that is resilient and inspired. And every time we turn to the next calendar cycle, it’s a blank canvas — an opportunity for the next generation to show that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For us to get to be a part of this iteration of Isla Vista and feel like we’re actually doing work that the community is benefiting from — to me, there’s nothing better,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Some noted that they had not originally planned to speak but became convinced to after seeing others do the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many speakers urged for allyship from non-Black communities and emphasized the need for people in a position of privilege to self-educate about the Black community’s struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black people are everywhere and deserve to feel safe everywhere,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers expressed discontent with the Black student experience at UCSB, noting a lack of resources and a small population of Black students, </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently at 5%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the undergraduate student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walk in I.V. and see what it feels like to have everybody staring at you for no damn reason,” one speaker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers shared personal accounts of police violence and fears that their Black loved ones could wrongly face violence or death at the hands of law enforcement. One speaker recounted a conversation with her younger sister in which her sister said she was afraid to go for a walk, or for her father to leave the house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I tried to tell her that she is safe, but I know in the back of my mind that that was not true. Even if she does everything right, even if she gives them no cause to bother her, there is a chance that she might become the victim of police brutality in this country just because of who she is,” the speaker said. </span></p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-94721-2-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94743\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94744\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94768\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94747\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94742\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94741\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94746\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94745\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94748\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94766\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethan Bertrand, a member of the I.V. Community Services District Board of Directors, recalled a conversation he had with his own father before his father visited I.V. for graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to say, ‘Dad, you’re an older black man walking around our community and some people may see you as a threat. Some people may not think that you belong here, which you do, but some people don’t understand that, so please be careful,’” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so hard for us to find the strength to battle through our tears to say that once again, we’re going to stand together and stand up,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers also stressed the need for Black voices to be heard and acknowledged by non-Black communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pay attention to Black voices. Stop trying to speak over us. Stop trying to tell us what the answer is,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several UCSB administrators were in attendance at the demonstration, including Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life; Aaron Jones, director of the Educational Opportunity Program; and Diana Collins Puente, director of community affairs, student development and leadership at UCSB’s Associated Students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s absence and lack of communication prior to the start of the march was widely criticized by participants. About halfway through the speeches, Yang sent out a mass email to the student body that addressed Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for those affected by his death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His words mean very little to me at this point,” one speaker said after reading aloud Yang’s statement to the crowd.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 1:30 p.m., protestors marched through I.V. chanting and holding homemade signs, as employees at local businesses observed from behind windows or stood outdoors to cheer on protestors. Once it reached Del Playa Drive, the crowd drew Isla Vistans out onto their balconies and into their yards. Some observers held their own signs and clapped for protestors, while others silently stared as the crowd marched toward Sands Beach, gathering more marchers along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surfers on bikes and families with children stood off to the side while protestors made their way down the dirt trail to Sands Beach, eventually gathering in a circle in a small field, where the demonstration’s organizers thanked the crowd for its solidarity and called for 30 seconds of silence to remember Floyd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those 30 seconds, protesters held their fists high in the air, some closing their eyes, the sound of the breaking waves the only noise.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

It’s just so hard for us to have visibility in Isla Vista, on campus, no matter where, which is why I chose to walk through DP to Sands Beach,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demonstration is not being organized in collaboration with any student organization, as Sanders said he felt that tying the demonstration to a specific organization — or even “too much to myself” — could come across as “performative” and take away from its purpose of standing up to racial injustice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he hasn’t worked out the specifics of the demonstration yet, Sanders said community members and UCSB faculty have been helping him organize it. Sanders said he’s been working closely with Mhoze Chikowero, a professor in the history department, who has guided him in structuring the demonstration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After seeing the video of Minneapolis police officer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sanders said he immediately felt “clenched with anger and disappointment” and took the day off from school to gather his feelings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was tired of being here and not doing anything, and I had to turn my sadness into educated outrage,” he said. “And I felt like the only way that I would be able to relieve that is through reaching out to the community and starting something like this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After posting the information for the demonstration on Thursday night on Twitter, Sanders said he was only expecting about 30 to 40 people to be in attendance. But now, “hundreds of people might show up”; almost 1,000 people have liked Sanders’ post about the demonstration on Twitter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This kind of all happened really fast. I wasn’t expecting as much community support for this to really take off like that,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are also keeping the coronavirus pandemic in mind, as they are wary of spreading the virus through I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a fifth-year global studies major and former A.S. senator who reached out to Sanders to help organize the demonstration, spoke at a special Senate meeting on Friday asking senators to attend the march and said he would be there passing out masks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, Dumlao said that he reached out to Sanders after seeing his tweet about wanting to organize a demonstration and offered to make flyers with QR codes to pass out to people who might not know what the demonstration was about, in addition to passing out masks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I work at Pardall Center and we are distributing masks, Mondays and Tuesdays 11 to 1 p.m., and because we have so many right now, and obviously it was gonna be a big gathering, I asked my supervisor if I could pass [the masks] out and I just got clearance,” Dumlao said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao added that since the event is a march, it’ll be easier for people to maintain a safe distance from people they don’t live with, and that organizers plan to make an announcement before the march reminding people to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Dumlao said he offered to lead a group of non-Black people to be liaisons if police officers got involved and “things got heated.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeyVibe5/status/1266510405288919040\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Twitter that he had been in communication with UCPD and said that officers told him that “they will not attempt to impede or stop the protest as long as it remains peaceful.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the demonstration scheduled to take place in less than a day, Sanders said it is his hope that the event serves as a reminder to “subscribe to the acknowledgement of [keeping] the Black community at your heart and to keep standing up against racial injustice.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can’t pick and choose when to be an activist or when to support Black people. It has to be an all-the-time thing for sure,” he said. “Even if [this demonstration] encourages like five people to always be aware of the struggles that Black students go through and gives Black students the feeling of being seen here in this community, that’s definitely the goal of this whole thing.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Courtesy of Katherine Price</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going away for college meant spending Ramadan away from home, but Muslim students made it a priority to foster their own sense of community in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, amidst the coronavirus pandemic, these students have been scattered back to their hometowns, some celebrating with their families for the first time in years, while others have stayed in Isla Vista, spending the month markedly more alone than usual.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salman Sadak, a third-year biology major and vice president of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), spent Ramadan in his hometown — his first Ramadan at home since coming to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s very nostalgic in that it gives me a feeling of the Ramadans of my childhood, like breaking the fast with my parents and family and waking up at 4 a.m. helping my mom cook,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadak said that many members of the MSA talked about how much they miss having Ramadan on campus because of how it brings them closer together. Despite the pandemic, the MSA has still been holding its weekly general meetings on Zoom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It isn’t just like a one-day event, it’s like an entire month, and you see these people every single day kind of out of necessity because you gotta eat.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At night, when they would have normally gone to the mosque for what Sadak describes as both a social and spiritual experience, they instead view a live telecast that the mosque provides.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m still getting that spiritual connection, and even though we’re all separate, we can still livestream the prayer, pray with the imam, still get that ritual in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being able to gather in-person is one of the cornerstones of celebrating Ramadan, and despite celebrating at home, physical distancing requirements have made this Ramadan different from many students’ childhood celebrations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huda Faiz, a third-year biology major and former MSA president, is currently at home, and said the connections with others were missing this year compared to normal years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Usually we go to the mosque at night for prayers and whatnot, and it’s kind of nice to connect with community and see all your family, friends and everyone in one place, but that’s kind of missing,” Faiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make up for it, Faiz said that some people have even decorated corners of their homes to resemble a mosque. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said she usually travelled back home for Eid al-Fitr to attend a celebration with her family at the Muslim Community Association, a large mosque and community center in Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll all dress up and we’ll go do our prayers there,” Faiz said, adding that most of her relatives live in Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll meet all of them and take part in the festivities,” she said. “Now, there’s nothing going on … visiting people is really big in Eid and you go and you visit all your family friends, so that’s definitely missing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tala Alawwad, a second-year biochemistry major, spent Ramadan in Isla Vista. For the most part, she would break fast alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes I did eat with friends, just as dinner for them but breaking my fast for me, and that was fine,” Alawwad said. “Home for me is in Abu Dhabi … [my family is] just home and together, and that’s usually how it is … and at least they have each other to be spiritual and engage with the traditions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Price, a first-year linguistics major and the secretary of the MSA, would have been celebrating her first Ramadan with other Muslim UCSB students this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were going to have all of these iftars, all of these dinners set up like four out of the five days of the week; we would have restaurants coming in and catering all of this really good food,” Price said. “It was going to be really exciting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as the pandemic began to shut down campus, Price said she had to start calling and cancelling all the orders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said the iftars would often draw close to 100 people, with not just undergraduate students in attendance but staff, faculty and graduate students as well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was super festive, super fun … and we really missed out on a lot of that,” Faiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the MSA has held interfaith iftars on campus, inviting other religious organizations to break fast with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Iftar is not just something for the Muslim community to take advantage of, but we also use it as a moment to get to know our fellow UCSB community and Isla Vista community, so it kind of makes me sad that we don’t really get that opportunity this year, but hopefully next year,” Sadak said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift to online classes also provided some Muslim students with more flexibility, as balancing their fasting with a full day of being on campus was often draining. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In past years, Sadak had trouble during evening classes and labs which did not allow students to eat, therefore preventing him from breaking fast during class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With online classes, it’s been more chill,” Sadak said. “Just being at home … it’s just been a lot more manageable, and I feel like professors are already really understanding about the whole COVID situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had an exam at a certain time right when I would have to break my fast, and I talked to my professor about it and he was understanding because, you know, it’s like everyone’s already dealing with so much.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz added that walking around campus all day usually left her in a “fasting fog,” in which she was more fatigued and was not able to concentrate on anything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With classes being recorded, now that they’re online, I can kind of shift my whole sleep schedule and rest a little bit during the day and watch more of the class videos at night,” Faiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Alawwad felt that online classes were actually more draining than in-person classes during Ramadan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last year, I would try to occupy myself, go to classes, see people, kill time … you’re not thinking about the hunger as much as you are sitting at home,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Faiz, being at home and indoors most of the day has made breaking fast easier compared to being at school, especially since she breaks fast with her family, a built-in community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s friends, I feel like we’d all have different schedules and sometimes it’s hard to find a time that matches for all of us to get together,” Faiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being stuck at home, Faiz, Sadak, Alawwad and Price all said they dressed up to celebrate Eid. Sadak celebrated with his family in his backyard, and Allawad called her family on Zoom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I bought my dress months in advance,” Price laughed. “I was so ready for it, I was gonna show off.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista’s average response rate is under 50%, below the national response rate of about 60% and Santa Barbara County’s overall self-response rate of about 64%, according to the United States Census 2020 website. I.V. is divided into three census tracts, which are subdivisions in each county used in the counting process; I.V.’s three tracts divide the unincorporated district into strips perpendicular to the ocean. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista has been designated a hard-to-count community. This was before the pandemic,” Spencer Brandt, president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said I.V.’s young population already made gathering census responses in the community challenging. With the pandemic forcing social distancing regulations and</span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the retreat of Santa Barbara Community College and UC Santa Barbara students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, educating  I.V. residents and conducting typical census outreach has been complicated. If response rates remain low, the community risks losing crucial funding, Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether or not people are counted in our community will affect a ton of different government and education-related programs for funding and how much funding Isla Vista and the UCSB area receives,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of the census affect a decade’s worth of congressional representation and federal funding in communities, which could go toward projects ranging from infrastructure and highways to school lunches and special education, according to the </span><a href=\"https://2020census.gov/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Census website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normal deadlines and operations in the census project have been extended due to complications from the coronavirus pandemic, and the I.V. CSD is looking for volunteers to start calling households as part of the next phase of the census tracking, according to the I.V. CSD website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a similar point in the 2010 U.S. Census, I.V.’s response rate was about 60%, according to the I.V. CSD website. None of the three census tracts in Isla Vista have reached 50% as of May 26, and</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“undercount of this magnitude would severely negatively impact Isla Vista’s funding until the year 2030,” according to the I.V. CSD website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”We’re gonna employ every effort that we possibly can to try to get the word out to people,” Brandt said. “The biggest thing that residents can do if they’re concerned about the population is … spread the word to still get counted in Isla Vista [and] don’t get counted at your parents house.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite students’ return to their hometowns, the U.S. Census Bureau said students should respond as if they were at their normal place of residence in I.V. Students normally living in on-campus housing are automatically counted in the census through the university. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

A couple of salient memories of the time for me include having to tell the women of Tri Delta that they had lost two of their members due to a senseless act of violence. A happier memory is creating the I Heart UCSB Pledge with student leaders that is now read with all new UCSB students during orientation as they receive the I Heart UCSB pin. I will be remembering the students we lost this Saturday while I visit the benches created in their memory, located in the Love and Remembrance Garden that I helped envision and organize.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yasamin Salari — 2020-21 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista has been the first place I’ve felt at home since I moved to the U.S. The vibrant sense of community, the friends who have supported me through all my ups and downs in the past three years and the mere beauty of our campus are just a few reasons I’ve felt so welcomed here. Our beautiful town has also endured great hardships. I was only a freshman in high school when the May 23, 2014 tragedy occurred in I.V., but my brother was a student at UCSB at that time and I remember so distinctly the sense of grief that took over my family that night. Although it was the immense sense of grief that brought together our community at first, we have continued to commemorate this day by remembering and honoring the lives lost on May 23.</span></p>\n<p><b>Christian Ornelas — 2019-20 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the last four years, Isla Vista has been my home. It has sheltered me and given me the tools I needed to grow. In my role as the External Vice President for Local Affairs, I had the privilege of developing relationships with the many people that dedicate their lives to making this community a safe and inclusive home for all of us. This special little place by the sea has taught me the value of friends, neighbors and community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I was not in Isla Vista on May 23, 2014, I continue to feel the collective grief shared by our community. The aftermath of that day brought together a beloved community that continues to memorialize the lives lost. We remember George Chen, Katherine Breann Cooper, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, Weihan “David” Wang and Veronika Elizabeth Weiss. If you find yourself in I.V. on Saturday, I invite you to pick some flowers and leave them at the Isla Vista Love and Remembrance Garden adjacent to Embarcadero Hall in People’s Park.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To all the caretakers of Isla Vista — thank you. Let us never forget about the events that took place in 2014, and let us always remember to move forward with love and compassion in honor of those we lost.</span></p>\n<p><b>Jeike Meijer — 2018-19 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the painful circumstance of being physically separated this year, it is really difficult to come together and mourn in community. We are learning non-physical ways to show our remembrance. This year, I’ll be using virtual ways to send remembrance to the lives lost and the friends and families of the victims. I also will be giving energy and healing to the first responders and community members whose lives were so pivotally impacted on this day of tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will also be stopping by the Remembrance Garden on May 23 to mourn because that has become a place of gathering to honor the six lives lost. George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katherine Cooper, Christopher Michael-Martinez, Veronika Weiss: You will never be forgotten.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spencer Brandt — President of the Board of Directors of Isla Vista Community Services District</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My generation of students was the first to be fully removed from the May 23 tragedy. Unlike many of my friends that I would come to know and love, we were not in harm’s way when shots were fired. I was sitting at my parents house, watching the gruesome news unfold on Twitter. As I scrolled down the timeline, it became clear that the killer had left a manifesto of misogynistic ramblings that provided a clear motive for the violence. Soon, in a reaction to many users arguing that “not all men” held such misogynistic views, #YesAllWomen began trending, drawing attention to the harassment and discrimination that women experience every day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six years later, we can’t be physically together to memorialize the tragedy. But for me, the distance allows time to reflect on May 23 in ways that I haven’t in the past. This year, I’ve been thinking about how, as a straight white male, the tragedy reminds me of the responsibility I have to live out masculinity in a healthy way. Because toxic masculinity was an important factor in the misogynistic “incel” ideology that the May 23 killer professed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is no secret that toxic masculinity abounds in a college town like ours. As an elected official, I spend a lot of time focusing on worst manifestations of it: sexual assault, street harassment and interpersonal violence. And in 2014, mass murder. And while most in I.V. agree that these things are pervasive problems that we ought to solve, there is less discussion about how to promote and cultivate a positive vision of masculinity: one that means loving and respecting others, being honest with yourself about your emotions and desires and taking assertive action to stop unhealthy and harmful behaviors in other men. We owe it to George, James, David, Katherine, Veronika and Chris to have these difficult conversations, and constantly be doing what we can to make IV’s culture more inclusive.</span></p>\n<p><b>Margaret Klawunn — Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I arrived at UCSB in the fall of 2015.  I have been honored to participate in important commemorations of the loss this community suffered in 2014 each year that I have been here.  This year, I am on my way to the Love and Remembrance Garden to leave flowers there in honor of George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katie Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss. I recognize that others were wounded and many more deeply affected by the violence of May 23, 2014. This year, I am feeling deeply the impact of the coronavirus and the social inequities it has laid bare, and this grief and loss resounds with the misogyny and violence of 2014.  It is also evident to me that there has also been some incredible love and light that emerged as this community came together, and I continue to see that strength and power in Isla Vista among students, staff, faculty and residents. </span></p>\n<p><b>Batsheva Labowe-Stoll — 2017-18 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tragedy that occurred on May 23, 2014 in Isla Vista changed our community forever. The immense grief of students and community members sent shock waves that are still felt today. Yet through all the sadness and fear, Isla Vista came together to create incredible monuments in our community. Through hard work and advocacy, we now have a local government that listens and responds to the needs of its constituents. Today, I.V. is a safer, stronger, more resilient place than it was six years ago. We are more aware, more attentive and have no tolerance for hatred and violence. Our community will forever mourn the unnecessary and tragic deaths that occurred that day, but we will continue to be strong and move forward together.</span></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Abboud </b><b>— </b><b>General Manager, Isla Vista Community Services District</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still remember the days leading up, the day of and the days after so clearly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it always feels like yesterday. I knew someone who was murdered, some who were injured and countless people who were moments away from having been in the wrong place. I wasn’t in I.V. that night and had just completed my term as student body president, but rushed back as soon as possible the next day. I still hold some guilt over not being in town when it happened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That night changed me and many others, along with Isla Vista itself, forever. It was actually gut-wrenching at the time to see how Isla Vista was getting the attention it needed only after and because of six people being murdered. Ending the cycle of only supporting Isla Vista after major tragedies was a big reason why we created the Isla Vista Community Services District. I decided to stay in I.V. after graduating in the following weeks to work on this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, we can never forget those who were taken from us that night (George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katie Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss) and not give any attention to the person behind the tragedy. But it’s also important to remember how May 23 is connected to misogyny, white supremacy, toxic masculinity, gun violence, the incel ideology and in a way our broken mental health system. We need to always push against these things locally and beyond as they continue to drive other tragedies around the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, I’m staying home and getting in touch with the people who were also affected that night. I will also take a walk through the remembrance garden at the park.</span></p>\n<p><em>This article will be updated. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Coughlin for “stalking a woman in the Isla Vista area,” Zick said. The bus was subsequently towed following his arrest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is currently in custody at the Santa Barbara County Jail and is being held on $200,000 bail, according to SBSO. According to Santa Barbara County Jail custody logs, Coughlin works for Grubhub, an online food delivery service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBSO detectives conducted interviews with witnesses and administered “a behavioral threat assessment” of Coughlin, after SBSO “received various reports regarding Coughlin,” according to Zick. The detectives also searched through his social media accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Coughlin] caught the attention of locals with his references on social media to the tragic mass murder that occurred in Isla Vista in 2014.

CSD).</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s just not as much food around in the community as there is when we’ve got a full town and economy that is operating in a normal way, so hunger is a real issue,” Brandt said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CSD’s distribution program receives 125 food donations from McDonald’s and 75 food donations from Lunchbox, a Santa Barbara restaurant, amounting to 200 meals per day, according to Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, an expanded version of the I.V. CSD’s partnership with Northern Santa Barbara County United Way — the local branch of a community service nonprofit emphasizing houselessness assistance — previously used the small I.V. CSD office space near the community center to streamline houseless residents into the coordinated entry program, which aims to house houseless residents, according to Emily Allen, director of homeless and veterans impact initiatives at Northern Santa Barbara County United Way.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The program expanded to the community center to accommodate social distancing regulations and provide additional services, according to Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What folks can do at the Resource Center is obtain meals, care packages that include face coverings, hand sanitizer. Additionally, they can access our Wi-Fi if they need to check their email,” Brandt said, adding that houseless individuals could also use the Wi-Fi to file to receive a stimulus check.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The care packages contain bottled water, soap, toothpaste and other cleanliness tools, according to Allen.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other local food distribution services, such as the Miramar Food Pantry and the Associated Students Food Bank, are operating under decreased hours, which increases the need for additional food provisions, according to Allen.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the different meal shares that happened in the community stopped operating. And so pretty early on, one of the first things that we started to do was put together prepared meal boxes and just add non-perishable food for people,” Allen said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nature of houselessness, with precarious living situations and uneven access to necessities, makes it extremely difficult for houseless individuals to follow shelter-in-place orders or social distancing guidelines, according to Jonathan Abboud, the I.V. CSD’s general manager.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud added that the I.V. CSD is still looking for additional partners to help provide services for I.V.’s houseless residents, who he said are “affected the most” by the pandemic, but have the “least resources during this time.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/","id":4058,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[4057,4056,4055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In a Time of Crisis, Local Food-Based Services Step up to the Plate","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2020-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Co-op_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Co-op_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Food Not Bombs, the I.V.

Food Co-op is one of a handful of grocery stores in I.V. and has been relied on by many, especially now that access to larger grocery stores outside of I.V. may be a hurdle for community members in isolation</span>. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local food-based services, such as Food Not Bombs, the I.V. Food Co-op, the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank and Manos de Mapaches, are contributing to the flurry of local support that has come out of the coronavirus pandemic with new and improved services, such as daily meal distributions and grocery pick-up programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Not Bombs, a long-standing organization in I.V., has grown to meet the community’s demand for food access. The organization usually produces two meals per week but now produces five, which volunteers hand out in various parks in I.V. for those facing food insecurity, according to its Facebook </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fnbiv\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under normal circumstances, Food Not Bombs serves free vegan meals twice a week, in which most of its food comes free from local growers and markets, such as the Goleta Farmers Market and the I.V. Food Co-op, according to Jonathan Dickstein, a religious studies graduate student who has been volunteering at Food Not Bombs for over a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large part of Food Not Bombs’ normal operations involves group cooking, but volunteers have now shifted operations to cooking separately while in isolation, according to its Facebook </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fnbiv\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Not Bombs recently partnered with I.V. Food Co-op on April 28, purchasing the store’s packaged sandwiches, fruits, snacks and drinks to be distributed by Food Not Bombs’ volunteers at a lower cost, according to Melissa Cohen, the store’s general manager. In distributing food to community members, Dickstein said Food Not Bombs operates under the framework that “food is a right, not a privilege.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Food Co-op is one of a handful of grocery stores in I.V. and has been relied on by many, especially now that access to larger grocery stores outside of I.V. may be a hurdle for community members in isolation, according to Cohen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Food Co-op has made efforts to ensure that customers who are practicing social distancing have access to groceries, such as making its inventory accessible through an online platform known as </span><a href=\"https://islavistafoodcoop.storebyweb.com/s/1000-1/?fbclid=IwAR2onQTi2MT53jva0gL07GzPez42-r5g-V6C_XIoADg9s-kLXc0czx_pAiQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-op Curbside</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Customers can purchase their groceries online and have them bagged and brought to the curb for pickup at a time of their choosing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new program also provides services to those who are homebound and unable to pick up groceries at the store. Through contacting the I.V. Food Co-op, customers from  high-risk demographics can arrange a home delivery to minimize contact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There aren’t formulas for this; these are people developing all of these programs in [real] time. It is all very people-powered,” Cohen said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the I.V. Food Co-op has not been immune to the new pressures that the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing orders place on grocery stores and other essential services, Cohen said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have run the Co-op for 10 years, through shootings and riots and wildfires, and this has been as hard as everything combined together,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from Food Not Bombs and the I.V. Food Co-op, other local programs have stepped up to the challenge of combating food insecurity during this time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manos de Mapaches, an organization based in I.V. that was created on April 15 by UC Santa Barbara students, is also delivering groceries and supplies to those most vulnerable in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group is working to address the needs of the elderly, disabled and immunocompromised by pairing each community member with a volunteer who will coordinate the grocery delivery. Volunteers are typically tasked solely with the pickup and delivery of groceries that have been paid for in advance by the person ordering the service, according to Alec Valdez, a fourth-year history of public policy and law major and the founder of Manos de Mapaches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the program, still in its infancy, has remained flexible in order to adapt to different needs, according to Valdez. Volunteers are encouraged to coordinate with the person in need of service to find the most accessible system for ordering groceries, depending on the circumstances. Anyone under the age of 40 who is in good health and meets other criteria including practicing social distancing  can volunteer with Manos de Mapaches, according to its </span><a href=\"https://manosdemapaches.wixsite.com/sbhands/volunteer-with-us\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group is also developing a project called “Community Connections,” a social exchange program in which volunteers are digitally connected to people from high-risk demographics — such as the elderly —  to relieve the loneliness that has accompanied the shelter-in-place orders, according to Valdez.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manos de Mapaches is an effort that stemmed from the Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) at UCSB, according to Valdez, who is also the co-coordinator of C.A.B. Alternative Breaks. Because Alternative Breaks’ planned volunteer operations for the quarter had been canceled, Valdez said he created Manos de Mapaches to help serve others in this new reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea for Manos de Mapaches was inspired by a group of volunteers in New York called Invisible Hands, Valdez said. Like Manos de Mapaches, Invisible Hands also provides grocery shopping and deliveries for those who are most at risk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar light, the A.S. Food Bank has teamed up with the Foodbank of Santa Barbara County and recently shifted its services to the distribution of brown bags, containing items such as pasta, beans and sauces, according to its Facebook </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbasfoodbank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. Food Bank now distributes these groceries outside the front of its location at the University Center on Wednesdays and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The A.S. Food Bank is also giving out meal tickets through an online </span><a href=\"https://foodbank.as.ucsb.edu/swipes-for-us-application/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process, which can be used for pick-up meals at the Portola Dining Commons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic has put a strain on the community, Cohen maintains that the importance of food — now more than ever — is integral in keeping spirits high. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“More than food, these meals foster a moment of connection and seeing and being seen, and a reminder that everyone matters,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/","id":4035,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[4034,4033,4032],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Considers Hybrid-Instruction Courses for Fall Quarter 2020","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2020-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0434.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0434.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The county confirmed Isla Vista’s first case of coronavirus on March 30.

The university, however, has yet to make an official decision about the status of fall quarter instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think it’s out of the question,” Ali Javanbakht, interim Student Health service executive director and medical director, said in an interview. He’s been participating in almost-daily phone calls led by Chancellor Henry T. Yang, in which leaders from UCSB groups give updates and discuss the future of in-person instruction at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the general consensus is it’s not gonna be 100% in-person again. I don’t think anybody thinks that would be wise,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I don’t think that anybody thinks that having a completely remote fall quarter would be reasonable either. Most people are feeling like it would have to be some kind of in-between,” he added. “Some kind of hybrid.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea behind a hybrid-instruction quarter is to disrupt the transmission of coronavirus by reducing the opportunity for it to spread from person-to-person in close-contact environments like classrooms. Campbell Hall’s 900-person lectures and sections with students sitting desk-to-desk could be a thing of the past, at least for now, Javanbahkt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang’s COVID-19 Response Working Group, which includes leaders from all corners of the campus from Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises to the Academic Senate, is discussing ideas for new course structures and campus practices such as having in-person classes with smaller groups, face mask distribution to all students and faculty and single rooms for students living on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The steps need to be in place to limit how many times [and] how often different students congregate,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For hybrid classes, this could mean placing students in alternating groups for each course that switch between in-person instruction one day and remote instruction the next day, so that if a person in one class group gets sick, the virus would have less opportunity to spread to more people, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of face masks could also become a widespread practice on campus, as the working group is considering making them available to everyone who uses campus facilities. Implementing widespread use of face masks entails creating “the culture and the awareness” to encourage young people and students to use them, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For housing, UCSB is considering allowing only singles or doubles in its campus dorms and residence halls. However, there’s concern among the working group that there aren’t enough rooms available for this change, a problem that could potentially “push more people into Isla Vista, a place that we don’t have control over,” and where the spread of the virus could go unchecked, Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said I.V.’s unique population of UCSB students, Santa Barbara City College students, working adults and families means the path to testing must be pursued collaboratively by both the university and the county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The university] can certainly offer services and testing and give them to UCSB students in Isla Vista but that’s about half the Isla Vista population,” Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most scientists agree that the path to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">normal life starts with widespread community testing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but Santa Barbara County’s testing capacity has not extended beyond those who display symptoms or are at a high risk. Three new community </span><a href=\"https://publichealthsbc.org/testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">testing sites opened up in the county on May 5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Santa Maria, Lompoc and Santa Barbara. Everyone is eligible for testing, but essential workers, members of the high-risk population and those exhibiting symptoms are being prioritized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county confirmed Isla Vista’s first case of coronavirus on March 30. Five weeks later, it remains I.V.’s only confirmed case. While other communities in the county have seen a rising  number of cases, I.V.’s count has been stagnant for over a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of May 7, UCSB Student Health has administered 103 coronavirus tests; 102 tested negative and one was still pending at the time, according to Javanbakht. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UCSB Student Health has had to be “judicious” with its testing, Javanbakht said, since coronavirus tests are expensive — $60 per person — and in high demand and low supply. But testing needs to be expanded in order to get a sense of what the coronavirus spread looks like in the community, and as of now, Student Health services “is not set up to do that,” Javanbakht added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re talking about broad big scale testing … to pave a path forward to resuming operations, that’s a very different scale,” Javanbakht said. “[We] don’t have the resources to do that. That’s more of a campus-wide level of operation that would need to happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic has administered 14 coronavirus tests in I.V. as of May 7, but none have come back positive, according to Charles Fenzi, the chief executive officer and chief medical officer at the clinic. The clinic normally serves around 5,000 people, a number that usually goes down in the summer when students flock back to their hometowns, Fenzi said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible that I.V. is not seeing dramatic increases in coronavirus cases due to students returning home amid the move to online instruction, according to Fenzi. When students return, however, he said that the campus will likely need to look much different than normal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s gonna be a real push if we allow people back on campus to [return] in a way that is safe for everybody so the social distancing thing is going to be a fact of life for a long time,” Fenzi said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said overcrowding of residents in I.V. is a complicating factor in slowing the spread of coronavirus and one that will make the university’s decision on housing more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt is working with I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud and the county on a reopening planning group to draft guidelines and practices for the reopening of the economy and the education sectors in I.V., including Isla Vista Elementary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the county’s goal is to increase testing, Brandt said “it’s a slow process.” </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/05/01/santa-barbara-county-begins-community-testing-for-covid-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three new testing sites</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have brought the county up to about 200 tests per day since they opened, Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said he believes “many people in Isla Vista have been infected with COVID-19 but we either did not have the test at the time or they were just not prioritized for the testing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While communities across </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-08/these-are-the-california-businesses-that-can-reopen-and-these-are-the-rules\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California begin tiptoeing into the reopening process</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the picture of the coronavirus spread in I.V. remains murky. Javanbakht said the single case of coronavirus confirmed in I.V. since March 30 could mean “we just don’t have that many [cases] on campus or in Isla Vista” or “that we just haven’t tested the right people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the reality of the coronavirus spread in I.V. could have huge implications in the future for Isla Vistans and UCSB students, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you take a community and you test them and the positive rates are really low, is it because COVID hasn’t come there at all? Or is it because it came and spread and it went,” Javanbakht said, “and those are very different dynamics.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

IVYP’s normal services. <em>Courtesy of IVYP</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) usually provides year-round, full-day childcare — for children up to five years of age — and after-school care at Isla Vista Elementary and El Camino Elementary. But the coronavirus pandemic has forced the group to convert its services into an online platform, according to Lori Goodman, the program’s director. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, IVYP has pivoted to online materials, including activities and games that children and their parents can participate in together in lieu of IVYP’s normal services, Goodman said. But she added that bridging the digital divide has been a struggle for many families who use the online programs.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Not only do our families not have the kinds of computers they need and the Wi-Fi strength they need, they don’t have the computer literacy, and the same goes for some of our staff,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While facing challenges from the online-only format, IVYP is continuing to utilize online tools to support its families. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivyp.org/covid-19-resources.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online materials</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as “recreational activities, self-care, mindfulness and academic support” for elementary school-aged children are meant to help families who are struggling to adapt to at-home schooling for kids and remote work for parents, Goodman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the website offers articles in English and Spanish on how to talk to children who are struggling with social distancing and provides information on financial support resources for unemployed or furloughed workers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVYP is also implementing an online one-on-one tutoring program through Zoom for students whose parents might not have the skill sets to help them with homework, according to Goodman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to schooling resources, food insecurity has been “one of the largest issues” among families involved with IVYP, Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To support parents who are struggling to put food on the table, IVYP is delivering bagged, prepackaged food to families in I.V. By the third week of April, the program had delivered food to 200 families, and by the fourth week, over 300 families had been helped, according to Goodman. While this week’s numbers aren’t out yet, the growth of the program has been “exponential,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know people are struggling with food,” Goodman said, adding that being able to help people who need it “has been one of [our] biggest hopes.” Food donations are something that “always come up” when talking to families in I.V., she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman said that IVYP is also working with “extremely vulnerable” populations in the I.V. community, such as undocumented immigrants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since undocumented immigrants do not qualify to receive federal aid or stimulus checks, Goodman said that IVYP has been working with those families who are “out of a job, still paying taxes and becoming desperate” to provide them with community services and programs like the </span><a href=\"https://805undocufund.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">805 UndocuFund</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which can help provide financial assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While IVYP has seen success in helping those in need, other ventures from the community organization have been put on hold, Goodman said. Recent plans to host community events and other programs with the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) have been stalled, with no date in sight to resume, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll see how coronavirus impacts these plans, but we always want as much cooperation from the CSD as we can so we can put our resources together,” Goodman said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.
