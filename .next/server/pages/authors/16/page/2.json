who may feel they lack representation.</p>\n<p>To address college affordability, Morales has served as the legislative outreach director for the Coalition for For a Better UC and has worked on Assembly Bill 3153, which would extend the Cal Grant through the summer sessions.</p>\n<p>She said she has also worked with Monique Limon to address food insecurity on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Morales takes a refreshing approach to resources for students and affordability and is focused on including students that do not qualify for benefits or come from out of state.</p>\n<p>“Not all students are eligible for these kinds of programs including out-of-state and undocumented students, and yet we are still required to pay these student fees,” she said.</p>\n<p>Morales has experience working with Lobby Corps and arranging lobbying trips though she does not address the issues with lobbying, such as a lack of preparation and the effectiveness of the trips, like her opponent Madeline Loudon.</p>\n<p>According to the Associated Students legal code, the purpose of the external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) is to “serve as the official representative” of A.S. to the University of California Students’ Association (UCSA) Board of Directors as well as the United States Students’ Association (USSA).”</p>\n<p>Morales has served within USSA, giving her experience as a representative of the university, specifically within marginalized groups.</p>\n<p>While both Morales and her opponent have acknowledged their respective privileges and emphasized the importance of letting marginalized groups speak for themselves, Morales specifically addressed anti-blackness within the USSA and the UCSA.</p>\n<p>“I know what is good about [USSA] and I know what is bad, one of those things we have to work on in both spaces is getting rid of the anti-blackness that a lot of students have faced,” Morales told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Her experience working with El Congreso and in the Student Activist Network gives her a more diverse background, and the <em>Nexus </em>believes that her many ties to student groups on campus will allow for increased outreach and mobilization.</p>\n<p>It is her conviction and breadth of experience that make her the best candidate for EVPSA.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this

Queer Commission, diversity education coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), a board member of the Student Affairs Student Council and a director for the Coalition for a Better UC.</p>\n<p>The candidate’s experience working in all corners of campus demonstrates his ability to communicate with both students and administration.</p>\n<p>Dumlao, a third-year global studies major, has a dedication to making A.S. more accessible to all students in a tangible way; he proposes hiring presidential liaisons from various communities on campus to work directly with his office.</p>\n<p>Dumlao also understands the importance of putting student money to good use. His plan for a fiscal accountability task force would reallocate unused student funds for projects within A.S. and, if Dumlao follows through, could help ensure students’ money is not wasted.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> is also interested in Dumlao’s idea to reform UCSB students’ healthcare.</p>\n<p>Dumlao wants Student Health to accept all major insurance providers, as he said the service currently only accepts Gaucho Health Insurance. Through Dumlao’s plan to incorporate UCSB into the UC Health system, more students will have access to Student Health services, regardless of their insurance plan.</p>\n<p>While Dumlao is an advocate for empowering student voices within the association and has long-term goals like healthcare reform, the candidate also understands the day-to-day lives of students on campus.</p>\n<p>Dumlao’s proposal to create community study spaces in the library would provide a location for students of shared majors to study and communicate, which he said will facilitate more dialogue among the student body.</p>\n<p>While vague in its implementation, Dumlao’s eagerness to create small- and large-scale change on campus is admirable in a presidential candidate, especially with a term limited to a school year.</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel, Dumlao’s opponent running with Campus United, is qualified for the job of president with her experience as an L&amp;S senator and an apparent dedication to equality for students.</p>\n<p>Yet Kopel’s primary concrete plan for a natural disaster relief program, while well-intentioned in its structure, does not compare with Dumlao’s presentation of multiple feasible ideas and projects.</p>\n<p>Dumlao should also remember to carry himself with the dignity of his position, as his conduct in opposing ideas he disagrees with has a strong possibility of causing rifts within the organization.</p>\n<p>Dumlao has ambitious goals and a series of plans for tangible projects, but the <em>Nexus</em> would like to remind the candidate to remain inclusive of all

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico has been involved in the community since her freshman year, working as a community coordinator for the then-external vice president of local affairs, taking an active role campaigning for local self-governance efforts and being a serviceable helping hand to campus organizations as a student senator.</p>\n<p>If Dycaico can focus her organizing efforts on finding real-world solutions to the numerous problems affecting I.V., including safety and police presence, then her experience and knowledge of the community’s history will make her an effective EVPLA next year.</p>\n<p>The EVPLA is the executive A.S. representative for all things Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>As a first-year history of public policy major, Dycaico helped Third District Supervisor candidate Joan Hartmann register voters in the community. In the spring, she worked as the Community Services District (CSD) coordinator for the EVPLA office, months before the CSD became a reality.</p>\n<p>Dycaico spent that fall going door to door, asking people to vote on measures that would create both the district and a tax to fund it. She helped host a forum, held by the EVPLA office, featuring CSD Board of Directors candidates. Many of those candidates ended up on the board, but the CSD didn’t get its funding. This June, it will have another chance, and Dycaico is again campaigning for it.</p>\n<p>Since then, Dycaico has hunkered down on campus efforts. She was elected off-campus senator last spring. During her term, she is most proud of having been an effective liaison between the Senate and organizations like Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) and UCSB Lobby Corps.</p>\n<p>Rena Bahl, EAB co-chair, agreed Dycaico was a viable liaison who attended 75 percent of the org’s meetings — more than she was required to by A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>“She did a lot more than she was supposed to and put in way more effort than previous liaisons,” said Bahl, a third-year environmental studies and global studies major.</p>\n<p>During her <em>Nexus</em> endorsement interview, Dycaico proved she has a solid level of background knowledge of I.V.’s workings. She’s aware of current CSD projects and other I.V. fixtures like the Beloved Community conference and the I.V. Recreation and Parks District. Dycaico has formed opinions on tenant-landlord mediation and making Halloween safer.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Dycaico’s ideas for improving I.V. could use further work. Combatting I.V.’s burglary rates, she said, starts with giving its residents more replacement keys for their houses because too many are leaving their homes unlocked.</p>\n<p>Dycaico’s plan fails to consider that The Home Depot is only a 13-minute bicycle ride away from the southernmost block of I.V.</p>\n<p>Dycaico also introduced nothing new when it comes to engaging I.V.’s non-student population, including families and residents who do not speak English as a first language.</p>\n<p>Still, when it comes to understanding the projects already underway in I.V. and the bureaucratic tangles that may slow them down, Dycaico is the right candidate for the job. If she can get to know more of the folks in the community this summer and commit herself to understanding how they would like to be helped, Dycaico would do a fair job of representing the student population in I.V.</p>\n<p>Students can vote for Dycaico in the A.S. Elections by logging on to G.O.L.D. from April 23-26.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

figure, as the IVP is responsible for leading a Senate full of students with varying views.</p>\n<p>This past year, Pimentel served as an off-campus senator, co-chaired the Senate Internal Committee and was a policy intern at the I.V. Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Pimentel’s platform is focused on the accountability of A.S. senators with an emphasis on ensuring that senators are active and effective liaisons to their BCUs.</p>\n<p>While Pimentel has experience in A.S., the resolutions he has authored have been mostly positional and not directional, which means they represent symbolic measures and not direct actions. Pimentel helped author a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and hate speech, along with a resolution condemning cyber-bullying.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus </em>acknowledges the importance of positional resolutions, Pimentel’s resolutions do not involve concrete action.</p>\n<p>Pimentel’s opponent, current On-Campus Senator Steven Ho, has accomplished more directional work during his time on Senate, such as authoring a resolution to demand the resignation of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity director and helping with the demands of undocumented students on campus through the organization Improving Dreams Equality Access And Success (I.D.E.A.S.).</p>\n<p>Ho explained the work he has done on Senate but lacked a tangible plan on how he would organize the Senate itself.</p>\n<p>Pimentel expressed plans to hold “one-on-ones” with senators to hear about their goals and plans and offer them help.</p>\n<p>He also wants to create a written contract that states the exact responsibilities of each senator and how much honoraria a senator will be docked if a responsibility is not completed as a way to hold officials accountable.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> is impressed with Pimentel’s plan to “revitalize public forums” during Senate meetings. Often, public forum can create a hostile environment for discussion of controversial topics, so a new approach might be beneficial.</p>\n<p>Pimentel hopes to expand the roles and duties of the campus visibility director to bridge the gap between A.S. and the student body.</p>\n<p>If Pimentel can successfully incorporate new accountability measures for senators and support more tangible and directional bills, we believe he will be an effective and diplomatic internal vice president.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily

Her first project would be focused on possibly creating a database organizing outcomes of previous cases, which would help with future cases, she said.</p>\n<p>Ettleson’s only opponent in the S.A.G. race, Grecia Martinez, advocates for improved outreach and communication with organizers to learn about students’ rights, rather than the current S.A.G.’s use of polling.</p>\n<p>Martinez’s platform offers a vision of inclusivity and outreach which Ettleson could benefit from adopting; however, Ettleson’s focus on impartiality is a critical point of the S.A.G. position, an issue from which candidates should not waver.</p>\n<p>The S.A.G.’s role as an impartial advocate for the rights of all students, regardless of diversity of opinion and background, is critical in defending the basic freedoms that students have as listed in the Student Bill of Rights in the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the position of S.A.G. necessitates objectivity and the <em>Nexus </em>hopes that, if elected, Ettleson will perform to these standards.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82556\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82556\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/","id":2289,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2288,2287,2286],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Retraction: “ISIS Seizes FT, Establishes Gaucho Caliphate”","category":"Nexustentialism","subcategory":"Nexustentialism","publish_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Daily Nexus has retracted the satirical Nexustentialism blog post titled “ISIS Seizes FT, Establishes Gaucho Caliphate,” published at 5 a.m. on Oct. 21, due to the piece’s lack o...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/url.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1543922302\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57126\"><img data-attachment-id=\"57135\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-21/retraction-isis-seizes-ft-establishes-gaucho-caliphate/url/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/url.jpg?fit=178%2C240&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"178,240\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"url\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/url.jpg?fit=178%2C240&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/url.jpg?fit=178%2C240&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-57135\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/url.jpg?resize=166%2C224\" alt=\"url\" width=\"166\" height=\"224\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></strong>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> has retracted the satirical Nexustentialism blog post titled “ISIS Seizes FT, Establishes Gaucho Caliphate,” published at 5 a.m. on Oct. 21, due to the piece’s lack of proper editorial review prior to being posted.

Carrying around a previously opened container of liquor will result in an open container violation that includes over $100 in fines. And doing this when you’re not yet 21 carries a much heftier penalty, including “a mandatory court appearance, as well as a mandatory suspension of your driver’s license for a year, up to $675 in fines, or proof of completion of the Youth Offender Program,”according to the IVFP site.</p>\n<p>Don’t sit on the curb</p>\n<p>Just don’t do it.</p>\n<p>Safe DrinkingTips</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t Drink too quickly</span></p>\n<p>Drinking quickly can cause your blood alcohol level to spike sharply and potentially lead to alcohol poisoning, so pace yourself.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Know your limits when drinking</span></p>\n<p>Jason Vego, a campus liaison for the Alcohol and Drug Program, recommends starting slow if you’re new to drinking. With many students drinking out of those ubiquitous red cups, some party-goers fail to consider the true volume of alcohol entering their bodies, Vego said. It’s also important to take note of the difference in alcohol content of hard liquor versus alcoholic beverages like beer and wine.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Eat before drinking</span></p>\n<p>The human body naturally wants to eat every three to four hours, so you’ll want to put some food in your stomach before going out, Vego said. Satisfying those alcohol-induced munchies by eating after (or during) drinking is not proven to help lower blood alcohol concentration, although it can lessen the intensity of a hangover.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Drink plenty of water</span></p>\n<p>Drink water between drinks, as well as before and after drinking. Dehydration is the leading cause of hangovers, and that’s that shit no one likes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6><em><span style=\"color: #000080; font-size: x-large;\">Cracking the Books</span></em></h6>\n<h6></h6>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Go to office hours</span></p>\n<p>Within their first quarter, most new students find themselves crammed in massive lecture halls, amongst a sea of hundreds of other students. Attending office hours and building relationships with professors can bring valuable opportunities like performing research or receiving much-coveted recommendation letters further down the road. “You don’t need to have anything profound to say when you talk to your professor. Just introducing yourself and saying hello will get it started,” according to Dr. Dorothy Mullin, communication professor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Use campus resources</span></p>\n<p>The piles of ‘free’ activities, food and services are never-ending at UCSB, and in some way or another, they’re always needed. CLAS tutoring can help with academic struggles, while Counseling and Psychological Services, Career Services and the Health and Wellness can help with other areas of life. Even Associated Students and the Office of Student Life sometimes hold fun and helpful events, while offering other services. There’s also a Gaucho Skills page on Tumblr that includes 500 study tips from experts at UCSB.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Prioritize your work</span></p>\n<p>Making fancy Snapchats or beating your friends at beer pong might seem like a pressing concern at the time, but procrastination bears an ugly head come Midterms or Finals Week. “There’s no such thing as catching up on the quarter system. You’re either half a step ahead, or blowing it,” Paul Rivas, academic skills coordinator for CLAS, said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t skip classes</span></p>\n<p>Some professors seem to, or actually do, just read out of the book. Why get out of bed when you can learn everything at home? Because you’re paying for the lecture, and chances are, the classes you skip will miraculously include specific material that will be on the test.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t View classes as worthless</span></p>\n<p>We all need to get those General Education Requirements out of the way, so we end up taking classes seemingly irrelevant to our major or interests. But the fact is that diverse knowledge is the key to a well-rounded education, and a positive attitude can turn a ‘worthless’ class into a passion or even change of major.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Join a campus club or activity</span></p>\n<p>Whether you like exercise, activism, religious worship or even journalism, don’t be afraid to take advantage of what UCSB has to offer. There are groups for all interests, cultures, sexual orientations political causes, and if there isn’t one that suits you, then start one!Gladys Koscak, mental health specialist at Counseling and Psychological Services, said extracurricular activities are vital in maintaining a stress-free lifestyle. Likewise, Vice Chancellor Michael Young said he encourages students to explore their usual interests, but also “take some risks.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Take advantage of the beach</span></p>\n<p>The only school nationwide with its own private beach, UCSB is just minutes away from the shore. Start the morning off right with a relaxing jog, or try out surfing.
