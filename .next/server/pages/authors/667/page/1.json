With lyrics like, “Too many times we’ve been high/Then we’ve landed/Oh, that smile that you hide/Leaves me stranded,” La Roux tragically captures what it is like to be in a relationship where there is a lack of commitment or reciprocated effort. What makes this single so successful is that despite its simplicity, “Automatic Driver” maintains a complex, strong contrast between heartbreaking lyrics and upbeat music as La Roux documents her struggles in dealing with an uninterested lover.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZ2Wsgm_Cjg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“At The Door” by The Strokes</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After four years of complete silence and seven years since their last album release, The Strokes have finally returned with new music in anticipation of their upcoming album, “The New Abnormal,” which will be released on April 10. Their first single, “At The Door,” is an invigorating change from their classic hazy ‘70s rock sound; but don’t fret — even with the change to more modern pop in this song, Julian Casablancas’s dreamy voice keeps the music intact and similar to their classics. The lyrics themselves aren’t cries for help, but instead, in a distressed tone, they convey messages of hopelessness. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most captivating melodies of the song is around the 3:40 mark, giving off both church choir and “Midsommar” vibes. The verse ends with a melancholy yet optimistic persistence to exist: “I’ll be waiting from the other side/Waiting for the tide to rise.”</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CAz_vvsK9M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Dragon Ball Durag” by Thundercat</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In anticipation of the release of his new album “It Is What It Is” in April, Thundercat recently dropped a new single, “Dragon Ball Durag,” on Feb. 17. The track features groovy melodies, soulful vocals and jazz music set to lyrics like, “I may be covered in cat hair/But I still smell good.” Building off of the signature funkadelic sound of his previous album, “Drunk,” Thundercat proves once again that he can make you move and groove to just about anything. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ormQQG2UhtQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Let’s Be Friends” by Carly Rae Jepsen</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Singer and dance-pop powerhouse Carly Rae Jepsen excels when creating music that reflects the blooming and subsequent withering of her relationships; her latest release, “Let’s Be Friends,” marks another high in her flowering discography. The track is a sassy, antithetical response to the overplayed sentiment of Valentine’s Day, in which Jepsen cuts straight to the chase after a breakup, confidently responding, “Let’s be friends, then never speak again.” Backed by flamenco-inspired guitar progressions, an instrument uncommon in her catalog, the singer unabashedly celebrates the end of a relationship, expressing an annoyed exhaustion at the fizzling-out phase following heartbreak. The best part about this song is that it doesn’t take itself too seriously and successfully fulfills its one and only purpose: to be an unapologetic Anti-Valentine’s Day pop banger. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_OYT396cYw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Blueberry Faygo” by Lil Mosey</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although not officially released until earlier this month, Seattle-based rapper Lil Mosey’s latest release has already been widely circulated among fans thanks to both SoundCloud leaks and TikTok. Commonly alluded to in hip-hop records, “Blueberry Faygo” references a soft drink company based in Michigan. The breezy, melodic track samples “My, My, My” by Johnny Gill and has an extra verse not featured in the leaked recording. This viral track has definitely built momentum for Lil Mosey ahead of the release of his next album.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xreinp0-Yj4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Tập thể dục nè (Do Exercise)” by Kiên</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people view exercise as a dreadful process — and let’s face it, staying home and watching Netflix sounds much more appealing than sweating your butt off on the treadmill. However, Kiên, an underground Vietnamese rapper, has recently reminded us that exercise doesn’t have to be stressful if you keep an open mind. The song has a soft, dreamy and cheerful melody, combined with Kiên’s energetic rap and inspirational lyrics encouraging young people to wake up, go outside and enjoy the world. Besides promoting physical exercise, Kiên also challenges us to exercise our minds and to acknowledge that good things take time and effort and that if you really commit to change, “Heaven and Earth couldn’t even stop you.” Overall, the song is a great reminder to celebrate your youth to the fullest with great physical and mental health by standing up and venturing out into the exciting world. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QfKOOFvxHVM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Texas Sun” by </b><b>Khruangbin</b><b> and Leon Bridges</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The collaboration between soul singer Leon Bridges and instrumental rock group </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Khruangbin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is entirely unexpected and yet whole-heartedly fulfilling. With “Texas Sun,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Khruangbin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers a beautiful landscape of dreamy guitars and smooth percussion for Bridges to coast through and lend his powerfully nostalgic voice. The track is a must-hear for alternative rock fans this month, as well as the four-track EP it opens of the same name.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Whe7MURlKLw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristina Valencia, Liliana Linan, Aubrey Valerio, Justin Carrasco, Sunidhi Sridhar, Phoenix Pham and Karl-Erik Mills contributed to this article.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93207\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-01/tracks-of-the-month-february-2020/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93207\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-01/tracks-of-the-month-february-2020/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-01/tracks-of-the-month-february-2020/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-01/tracks-of-the-month-february-2020/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-01/tracks-of-the-month-february-2020/","id":6554,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6553,6552,6551],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Need Some Songs To Spice Up Your Valentine’s Day Plans?

Though the track’s lyrics are somewhat simplistic, with lines like, “I really like you/And if you </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">liked me too/I could be your girlfriend/You could be my dude,” Litany’s voice cr</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eates a soothing aura that flows seamlessly with the funky, synth music that’s guaranteed to stick in your head for days on end.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uc84gSTkTvs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Sweet Thing” by Twin Peaks</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sweet Thing” is one of those tracks that leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth (mostly sweet, of course) as it accurately captures tender, misguided, beautiful, youthful love. For instance, as Clay Frankel of Twin Peaks is serenading his lover in this song, he sings, “There’s women every single way I look/But you’re the only one that’s got me hooked.” It’s clear he really loves his partner yet is still asserting his egoism by explaining he has plenty of options for romantic endeavors. Twin Peaks does a great job of balancing these immature lyrics with more kind ones like, “Baby, I’ve been thinkin’ all about you lately,” which, when combined with the former, perfectly represents the imperfect and chaotic experience that is true love.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cA78HSQcyWA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Everywhere” by Fleetwood Mac</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This list would not be complete nor reasonable without mentioning “Everywhere” by ‘70s rock band Fleetwood Mac. The musicianship in the song is tremendous and inspiring, but the love message is lettered in the lyric, “I want to be with you everywhere.” This ballad embodies the infatuation that comes with love and the enamored mindset of wanting to be with your lover at all times, in all places. It’s hard to bring to mind a sweeter way to commemorate your loved one than to wish they’re with you everywhere you go. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YF1R0hc5Q2I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Warm” by Dre’es (ft. Mia) </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you have a Valentine this year or not, this song makes you feel like you’re in love. Dre’es’s and Mia’s voices perfectly complement each other over the beautiful chords, making “Warm” very pleasing to listen to. This track is what you daydream about when you finally meet your person and want nothing more than to be on a “faraway island in a blissful silence” with them. In essence, “Warm” highlights the most perfect moments in a relationship: the parts we can’t stop thinking about. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSfHYxDiuCc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Baby, I Love You” by the Ramones</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While, yes, the Ramones are known for kickstarting the fast-paced and loud genre of punk rock music, their rendition of The Ronettes’s “Baby, I Love You” sounds as classic a love song as any. The tenderness in Joey Ramone’s voice as he sings, “I can’t live without you/I love everything about you/I can’t help it if I feel this way,” is enough to serenade any person you’re hoping to court on Valentine’s Day. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGlZwwtp92A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“</b><b>Oh Honey” by Delegation</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O-o-o-o-h honey! All you need to hear is the opening instrumental to catch the vibes with this one. A pure gem and nostalgic oldie like “Oh Honey” by Delegation will leave you and your lover (or maybe just you) feeling some type of way and slow dancing wherever you may be. Delegation’s soulful vocals, mesmerizing synth, groovy bass and smooth keys are a must for any love-song playlist. The track’s immersive romantic funk will set the perfect mood for Valentine’s Day; you also may have heard it sampled in “Lottery” by Kali Uchis — another great addition to your special V-Day playlist.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BbMzoSVKp1Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“When I’m Sixty-Four” by The Beatles</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I’m Sixty-Four” was written by Sir Paul McCartney at the adorable age of 16, a suitable age for exploring romance along with all the tenderness and magic it has to offer. The track has a cheerful melody, and the lyrics paint a vivid daydream of a boy who fantasizes about the love of his life growing old beside him. It seems like as long as they stay together, even doing the most ordinary things such as going for a drive or gardening together will fill him with happiness and peace. The soft and heart-throbbing experience of falling in love is usually accompanied by the hope of your significant other being by your side forever, and in the spirit of Valentine’s Day, this song beautifully captures this heartwarming feeling.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HCTunqv1Xt4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“All About U” by 2Pac </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2Pac’s “All About U” is a gangsta ode to the idea of infatuation that has come to withstand the decades since its initial release. By chronicling his fast times in Los Angeles, 2Pac is able to spin a captivating tale that is relatable to anyone who has been played by an unfaithful lover. It keeps your elbows high, swaying side to side, and yet somehow, “All About U” still makes it difficult to keep your eyes dry.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jn9tMkqhWd0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“New Light” by John Mayer</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time you hear John Mayer’s “New Light,” you may feel an unquenchable urge to move, groove and, most of all, love. In the span of just four minutes, Mayer composes a painterly vision of a possible romance, defined by a beat like a yearning heart and a fluid synth that flows from ear to ear; you can practically see Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” materializing in your head as you listen. Ultimately, it does what all beautiful love songs should: it makes memories.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQ055hHdxbE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Electric” by Alina Baraz ft. Khalid</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone with limited experience when it comes to matters of the heart, I am not entirely sure what it would feel like to be head over heels in love with someone. But I would imagine it would feel a lot like this song. This track, romantic and very sensual at the same time, is the perfect addition to a Valentine’s Day playlist, a Netflix &amp; Chill playlist or an “In My Feelings at 2 a.m.” playlist. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwWrSR8SFEc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This cute classic, consisting of a duet between Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, will take you to new heights — and not just on V-Day. We’ve all heard the cheesy pop songs of the 21st century that sing about surface-level love, but nothing is deeper than this two-minute ballad comparing affection to geographical landforms. So don’t take any excuses from your significant other this Valentine’s Day because there “ain’t no mountain high enough” to keep them from getting to you, babe.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ABfQuZqq8wg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“I Touch Myself” by the Divinyls </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you and your partner are connoisseurs of comedy, you might get a kick out of the romantic yet insanely hilarious “I Touch Myself” by the Divinyls, which originally gained fame when it was featured in the film “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.” It’s all in the title — with this track, you can let your partner know just how attracted to them you really are. Wink wink.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wv-34w8kGPM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Kristina Valencia, Sunidhi Sridhar, Phoenix Pham, Omar Reyes, Aubrey Valerio, Neha Makkapati, Melody Pezeshkian, Hannah George, and Karl-Erik Mills contributed to this article.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/need-some-songs-to-spice-up-your-valentines-day-plans-weve-got-you-covered/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/need-some-songs-to-spice-up-your-valentines-day-plans-weve-got-you-covered/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/need-some-songs-to-spice-up-your-valentines-day-plans-weve-got-you-covered/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/need-some-songs-to-spice-up-your-valentines-day-plans-weve-got-you-covered/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/need-some-songs-to-spice-up-your-valentines-day-plans-weve-got-you-covered/","id":6548,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6547,6546,6545],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Playboi Carti Set to Headline Extravaganza 2019","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Previews: What's Going On","publish_date":"2019-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Playboi Carti and Aminé are among an eclectic mix of artists slated to perform at Extravaganza 2019 this Sunday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S.

The band has broken past the realm of YouTube with the release of their 2018 album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being So Normal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Known for their soft and slow hits “Peach Pit” and “Alrighty Aphrodite,” the band features euphonious guitar solos and metaphorical lyrics that create a unique sound differentiating the group from their indie contemporaries. From quitting minimum-wage jobs to joining the lineup for Tennessee’s Bonnaroo festival, the gentlemen of Peach Pit will surely ignite the music scene in the near future. Peach Pit is the perfect ending to a spring day at UCSB, gracing the stage with a qwarkly, hipster aesthetic and stealing the hearts of alternative enthusiasts everywhere.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><b>Deorro</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Widely known for his single “Five More Hours,” deejay Deorro is set to perform at Harder Stadium this year. Deorro was born in Los Angeles and started his music career at the age of 14. His rising popularity over the past two years has been in part due to deserved support from collaboration with heavy-hitting artists such as Steve Aoki, Diplo and Carnage. Deorro has attracted an unwaveringly loyal fanbase, known as “PandaFam” — a strong testament to his musical craftsmanship. His newest single, “Keep It Goin,’” features Danny Avila and is distinctly fast-paced, involving dramatic buildups and drops. His Latin-themed songs like “Bailar” are festive and exciting as well. Whether or not you are a long-standing Deorro fan, his music is sure to get you moving. Offering a blend of both quick, hard drops alongside more melodic and danceable rhythms, his deejay set is sure to complement the rap headliners of this year’s Extravaganza. </span></p>\n<p><b>Empress Of</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lorely Rodriguez, better known as Empress Of, is making an appearance at this year’s Extravaganza. As an American singer/songwriter who has made a name in the indie music industry since 2012, her electric pop style incorporates notes of contemporary R&amp;B. Along with her popular feature with Khalid on DJDS’s song “Why Don’t You Come On,” Empress Of also appeared in Lana Del Rey’s album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and reached the top 10 on Billboard charts in September of 2015. With her recently released album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I’m With Him</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Empress Of has garnered a loyal fanbase on platforms such as YouTube and Spotify. </span></p>\n<p><b>Aminé</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portland rapper Aminé, born Adam Aminé Daniel, made waves within the hip-hop community with the release of his debut single, “Caroline,” in 2016. This record, which peaked at No. 11 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, was commended by critics and fans alike for its witty lyricism and uniquely eccentric production, and it went on to become one of the defining tracks of the year. Aminé’s second viral hit, “REDMERCEDES,” is remembered for its controversial music video, in which the rapper uses whiteface as he satirizes racial stereotypes prevalent within the hip-hop community and across the nation. His debut album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good For You</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, garnered a largely positive response and introduced him to a much more diverse fanbase, as his music was compared to that of the likes of Missy Elliott and Lil Yachty. Aminé’s sophomore project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ONEPOINTFIVE</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was released last August. The rapper recently wrapped the European leg of his tour in support of the album and is scheduled to play several festivals in the U.S. and Europe this summer. </span></p>\n<p><b>Playboi Carti</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of the pioneers of the next generation of hip-hop, Atlanta-based rapper Playboi Carti continues to forge his own path and defy the conventions set by those before him. His musical style relies less on elaborate lyricism and more on catchy flows and production. After generating much hype and anticipation amongst his fanbase, Carti’s eponymous debut mixtape was released in April 2017 and spawned hit tracks such as “wokeuplikethis*” and “Magnolia.” \\That same year, Carti was named in</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> XXL Magazine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s prestigious Freshman Class list, which is credited with catapulting the careers of many up-and-coming rappers. Last May, Carti released his first studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Die Lit</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which debuted at No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. The project garnered largely positive reviews from critics, with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pitchfork Magazine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> labeling it as an “album that works almost completely from its own lunatic script.” Carti is set to perform at the Governors Ball Music Festival next month and will join fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa as a special guest on tour this summer. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/","id":6943,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6942,6941,6940],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Songs to Cry to During Midterms: An Artsweek Playlist","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/15199760-beauty-girl-cry.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/15199760-beauty-girl-cry.jpg?resize=450%2C450&ssl=1","description":"In honor of midterms season, Artsweek has compiled a playlist of songs that are the perfect catalyst for emotional release. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>We’re finally at the halfway mark of the quarter, which means you’re working hard and deserve a good cry between weeks five and six.

It was only 30 seconds into the song and we were both already blinking back tears.

The last three minutes of pure instrumental leaves space to to pick yourself up after shedding some tears. Even though I want to “runaway as fast as [I] can” from midterms, if Kanye can push through his struggle, so can I. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lizzy Mau</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Vienna” – Billy Joel</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Slow down, you crazy child,” the Piano Man cautions us in these times of chaos. Beginning with a soft piano intro, Billy Joel mimics the feeling of drinking a glass of Chardonnay in the vineyards of Vienna, Austria. In an environment of complete confusion, where it seems like we are one midterm away from pursuing a career as a fitness model that advertises protein shakes on Instagram, the song reminds us to enjoy the here and now. Considering the fact that we are never guaranteed success, the only constant we can really rely on is that place, person or activity that inspires the energy we need to get through the many stressful days. So why not partake in a little bit of self-care and just enjoy life rather than speeding through its daily motions? “Vienna” waits for you. </span></p>\n<table style=\"height: 3662px;\" width=\"675\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medlyn Grasheyella</span></i>\n<p><strong>“Ex-Factor” – Lauryn Hill</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With breakup season on the way, this classic bop is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">certified</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cry. There’s something especially poignant about Lauryn Hill’s voice that makes her words carry enormous weight. Her croonings of lost love on this track are just as powerful 20 years later as they were then, and the soulful backdrop remains a timeless classic. “Ex-Factor” expresses feelings that we have all felt to some degree, whether it’s minor rejection or a world-crushing heartbreak. It’s also a bit ironic that Drake sampled this song shortly before getting exposed for hiding his child and abandoning the mother.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Pasion-Gonzales</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Eleanor Rigby” – The Beatles</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby” still haunts me and has ever since I was five, when my dad first played it for me. Even then, before I could understand the beautiful lyrics and the heartbreaking story they tell, I could feel the sorrow in this iconic Beatles song. After hours of self-imposed isolation, studying alone in the library for your first midterms of the year, you’ll be sobbing along when Paul McCartney asks where all the lonely people come from. A lament to the hardships of the elderly and dying alone, “Eleanor Rigby” will help you let out all those stress tears when you just need to simp during stressful midterm season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucy Holley</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars” – Mitski</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanna see the whole world / I don’t know how I’m gonna pay rent / I wanna to see the whole world.” Was wide-eyed mortal panic was ever felt, or said, so simply? In a panic bender of less than two minutes, Mitski pins everything from interview anxiety to ideal locations for death (Jerusalem, please). Her voice is frantic, carried by an instrumental that sounds less like guitar shredding and more like a guitar literally being shredded. It’s an experience accessible only after five shots of espresso.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if my body really is made of crushed little stars (which it is, according to popular consensus), remind me why I’m stuck memorizing solubility charts at 3 a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vidhisha Mahesh</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Three Little Birds” – Bob Marley</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because this song is filled with encouraging lyrics, it’s perfect for that moment during midterm studying when you’re about to tap out from exhaustion and frustration, but keep telling yourself to pull through because it’ll all be over soon. In that moment, you feel like every little thing is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gonna be alright, as Bob Marley says, since your test is tomorrow and you’re still up at 2 a.m. studying (and crying). However, once “Three Little Birds” engulfs your ears through the speakers in your headphones and Marley advises you to not worry about a thing, the tears once shed out of pure misery now emerge from a place of hope. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristina Valencia</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Doomed” – Moses Sumney</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somber and haunting, “Doomed” by Moses Sumney is the perfect track for your pre-midterm breakdown (or your post-midterm GPA funeral). Questioning the possibility of being doomed to live a life without love, Sumney’s existential crisis can easily translate to a college student’s eternal pondering of whether or not one can live without good grades, a degree or a job. Lean into Sumney’s mournful lyrics and breathtaking falsetto and supplement its lack of percussion with the steady sound of slamming your head into the library table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Jackson</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Needle In the Hay” – Elliott Smith</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you press play and the grim chords of “Needle In the Hay” lead into Elliott Smith’s somber tone of voice, you can predict where the song is about to transport you. The track is quick in being applicable to the plethora of feelings a college student will likely experience during midterm season, meaning that it’s perfect to sob into the night before your dreaded exam. As Smith sings, we experience feeling “strung out and thin” as we attempt to cram in material before exam day, somehow not remembering anything from the past few weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony Singh</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Tears Dry On Their Own” (Original Version)  – Amy Winehouse</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winehouse sings of her despair and feelings of regret as she begins to walk away from a lover. The pain she feels from trying to move on is especially felt in her vocals in this original version. The songstress’s vivid lyrics bring listeners back to a time when they, too, had to close a sentimental affair. The backup vocalists singing “tears dry on their own” at the end of each chorus resemble a heartbreak song from the Motown era.This song is guaranteed to leave you crying as you cope with the end of your social life during midterms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erica Delamare</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Rock Bottom Riser” – Smog </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes you get a lead feeling in your bones, or you feel empty after the stress of exams. As I inch toward my first college midterms, I am reminded, once again, of the feeling of home — the warmth of my mother, or even my cat — and I am whole again. This song encapsulates this as I realize that this isn’t the end, that midterms won’t be the death of me and that I, too, am a rock-bottom riser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sai Sondh </span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Come Back to Earth” – Mac Miller</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mac Miller’s “Come Back to Earth” from his final album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swimming</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great song to cry to when stressing out over midterms. “Come Back to Earth” has poignant lyrics that focus on mental health. Miller maintains, “My regrets look just like texts I shouldn’t send … I just need a way out of my head.” I think we can all relate to sending a risky text to a friend or significant other and overthinking it, or having an endless cycle of negative thoughts. UCSB students can also relate to the lyric, “And don’t you know that sunshine don’t feel right, when you inside all day.” Who wants to be inside studying all day at the library when you could be out soaking in the sunshine or surfing at the beach?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan Wiitala</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“SUMMER”- BROCKHAMPTON</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the heat of the summer I had no papers to write, midterms to take or TAs who won’t email me back. At this point in fall quarter, I know the one thing we all want more than a 4.0 GPA is to go back to irresponsibly basking in the Isla Vista summer sun with all of our friends on an oceanside deck. Go ahead and give “SUMMER” by BROCKHAMPTON a listen and let that summer nostalgia sink in to the sound of wistful piano chords and guitar runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin Fauni</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“The Middle” – Jimmy Eat World</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s that time of the quarter again. Your brain feels like that microwaved mashed potato you forgot about after all your doze-offs snowballed into two-hour naps. But if you’re anything like me, you’ll find that the best remedy for midterm melancholia is some nice, wholesome 2001 pop-punk. Still don’t understand the confusing way your calculus professor teaches u-substitution? “Just do your best, try everything you can!” Hand cramping from all the bubbling and writing? “It just takes some time!” Feeling like this class is dragging on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> longer than you’d like? “You’re in the middle of the ride, everything will be just fine, everything will be alright!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vince Feliciano</span></i></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit;\">“No Hard Feelings” – The Avett Brothers</span></strong><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s midterm season and you feel like you’re dying, so why not listen to a song that perfectly embodies that emotion? “No Hard Feelings” by the Avett Brothers is that song. Its calming melody paired with its depressing lyrics about death is the perfect combination to induce a stream of tears. The Avett Brothers have a profound way of making music that touches the innermost core of our emotions, and this is especially true of “No Hard Feelings.” So sit back, let your existential crisis consume you and cry it out to the Avett Brothers (and their ever-present banjo).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elissa

seven, I realized something was wrong with me. The unfaithful ending to my parents’ marriage as a result of my cheating father disintegrated my perception of my favorite human and what semblance I had of a nuclear family. At the time I couldn’t process all of this, and I didn’t know how to feel or what I was feeling. I was sad, I felt empty, I felt alone, I felt misguided, I felt angry. My mother had to take up two jobs to keep us afloat, and with no guidance on what to do with my emotions, I ate. I gained more weight, and I grew sadder as my confidence plummeted and my perception of myself was low. By age eight, I had come to terms that whatever fate lay ahead wasn’t going to be better than what I was living through. But my sister stopped me from committing suicide. I don’t know at what point things started to get better, but I do remember at the same time there was Bob.</p>\n<p>The sweet drums that began every song woke me up each morning, and the next thing I heard was the sweet voice and redeeming lyrics of reggae legend Bob Marley. After discovering his discography in the rom-com “50 First Dates,” I was hooked. His lyrics about the struggle of love, freedom, redemption, peace and life filled the emptiness I felt. Simultaneously, life was improving. I began to do soccer and lose the weight that had crippled my happiness, and I got to see my mom more.</p>\n<p>However, the feelings of emptiness and sadness still haunted the back of my head. That’s when I discovered System of a Down in the fifth grade. I can remember the first time I heard “Lonely Day.” It struck me to my roots; a counter to Bob’s positive rhythms, it helped soothe the anger and sadness that I did not understand. After this, I began to look more into the lyrics of other System of a Down songs and learned about things like the Prison Industrial Complex, Armenian Genocide, drug addiction, Tiananmen Square and American global militarization. I began to question the significance of my issues and began to focus on the struggles that communities across the world face.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As I grow older, I have begun to unpack the emotions I’ve suppressed and grown with, and how it has made me who I am. I continue to deal with my depression, but music continues to put melodies and words to emotions that I cannot. It continuously shows me that I’m not alone and helps me put a skip to my step on the mornings when I don’t want get up.</p>\n<p>–– Ivan Gonzalez</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most common form of music celebrated in America today is recorded music played from a phone or laptop. Recorded music is a valuable tool that can guide you out of one mindset and into another. Some songs are so intimate that they have the ability to validate your emotions with their lyricism. Songs that echo your emotions can be an incredible source of comfort in times of distress. Both a good friend and I each have our own Spotify playlists following the theme “comfort music.” These playlists are filled with songs from artists like Keaton Henson, The Smiths, Daughter, Chad VanGaalen and Sufjan Stevens. For an old friend of mine, listening to Sufjan Stevens was the only way to guide him out of a panic attack.</p>\n<p>An incredibly unifying form of music is live music. Live music not only has the power to bring groups of otherwise incompatible people together, but it also possesses the ability make people dance. Dancing is a way to find peace of mind; when moving my body in synchronicity to music I find it hard to have a stream of thoughts. To dance is to be expressionistic and aerobic at once, blending athleticism and artistry. I once attended a House Music concert and danced for nearly eight hours straight, completely absorbed in the beat, sound and the moment. I believe it’s really important for people to find time to silence their mind and be present with their bodies and live music provides an excellent opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p>Creating music, though, has to be my favorite way to find either calmness or expression. I feel in this way you can really feel the energy of the music flowing through you. Writing a song allows me to transpose my own emotions into a set of chords or a melody. If I am feeling especially expressive, I might add lyrics to fit the song. I find that I am able to express myself more completely in song than I would be able to on paper or in conversation. Articulating how I’m feeling in such an engaging way is incredibly healing.</p>\n<p>Creating music with other people is also so important when it comes to mental wellness. Entering an intimate space with a group of other people, even strangers, is unifying. Harmonizing with other people, especially in singing, has always been an absolutely connecting dynamic for me. In times of loneliness and despondency, a person or group of people that can harmonize together can be incredibly uplifting. Music in its many forms provides a gateway to mental wellness. A reason why music can make you feel good is partially because of the way it resonates with you — both physically in the form of sound waves and mentally in terms of melody, chord progression and lyricism. Sound waves themselves are incredibly healing agents which, when used with the right skill, can bring people out of moments of incredible emotional trauma.</p>\n<p>–– Melody Pezeshkian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One notable part of my childhood was the fact that it was literally accompanied by constant background music. My parents’ massive CD collection, which took up an entire wall of shelves in my house, was taken advantage of to the fullest –– our house was never silent except during the depths of the late night and early morning. Hours of subconscious listening to great musical geniuses from Miles Davis to Beethoven to Brian Eno created the template that shaped my childhood and cemented music into my very existence.</p>\n<p>This subconscious appreciation and gravitation toward music as a necessity rather than an embellishment offered itself as a revitalizing force when my personal struggles with anxiety peaked and pummeled me to the ground. Whether by offering analog nostalgia –– or rather the grounding sense of relatability –– music was, above all, a consistency. A consistency in times where I was drowning in sea of inconsistency. Regardless of where I was, what I was doing or how I was feeling, I could always turn to the euphoria and consolation that music provided me.</p>\n<p>Having a very broad taste in music, it is interesting to look back on playlists and albums that I wore out during times of significant personal mental-health struggles. Songs varied from sappy Frank Sinatra love songs to the most aggressive tunes that Death Grips has to offer. In these difficult periods of my life, my subconscious gravitated toward music that I could (even if entirely unknowingly) relate to. As the styles and artists that I indulged in changed, one thing stayed the same: I never stopped listening to music.</p>\n<p>Music is the most reliable, most adaptable and possibly most entertaining companion to have when dealing with mental health problems. Although others may not have the same childhood experience as me, music is a universal force that shapes many people’s lives. In times where stress, anxiety or depression are controlling you in every sense, music can be the light at the end of the tunnel, an element of consistency and the companion that always appeals to what you truly need the most.</p>\n<p>–– Sonya Sherman</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I am a person who hides things. All my life, especially throughout high school and the beginning of college, I have always hidden things from my friends, parents and, to some extent, also from myself. It took me about three years to admit to myself that I was not okay in the normal sense, and when my C.A.P.S. counselor told me I had depression, I wasn’t shocked in the slightest.</p>\n<p>The same day I had my first C.A.P.S. appointment, I bought Spotify premium. I didn’t plan this; it was just something that happened. I had been using regular Spotify for a while, and the ad interruptions just weren’t cutting it for me anymore. I started making playlists and, like almost everyone else, I created one playlist full of sad songs. I called this playlist “Happy Music” because sharing emotions still wasn’t my forte. As I added more music to this playlist, it slowly became a soundtrack to my feelings. This soundtrack was the only way I felt comfortable externalizing the inner goings of my mind.</p>\n<p>In denying my depression from myself, I had never let myself be sad. I couldn’t allow myself to feel down on the weekends because those were the days I volunteered. Forget Mondays and Thursdays from 9-12; that was when I had dance practice. In this fashion, I gave myself very limited time periods during which I let myself stop hiding my emotions. It was at these times that I listened to my “Happy Music” playlist. The music let me just sit with myself and take a deep breath. Yeah, it’s cliché, but it was when I was listening to music that I wasn’t forcing myself to put up a façade to the outside world.</p>\n<p>Music didn’t help me by making me happier all of a sudden; music helped me take the first step in letting myself accept that I was depressed. I still have depression. The numb feeling that I’ve associated with almost everything hasn’t disappeared. However, I’ve taught myself that it’s okay to listen to my “Happy Music” playlist between classes, when I’m doing homework or just working out. Music brought my out of hiding and taught me that my depression isn’t who I am, but it is currently a part of me, and that’s okay.</p>\n<p>–– Anushna Patel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anxiety. It’s the toughest feeling to pinpoint and gives the most bizarre sensations throughout my body, whether that be pains in my head or shortness of my breath. For years, I have set out to discover personal temporary cures to my anxiety, and one of the most crucial, consistently useful tools is music. Music possesses a power like no other, brandishing the ability to influence our heart and breathing rates. As the perfect tool to combat anxiety, it’s unbelievably reassuring that putting my earphones on and listening to music can soothe unwanted anxious feelings.</p>\n<p>Years ago, I experienced a panic attack so severe that I was positive I was going to die. Despite the shortness of breath and heart palpitations, I decided to sit on the couch, take deep breaths and turn on the TV to distract myself. Thankfully, I somehow came across a channel playing bits of Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac and James Taylor concerts. Enveloping my attention in the tranquil, simplistic beauty of these songs immediately soothed my anxious thoughts, compelling me to understand life’s underlying simplicity and the sense that everyone else possesses uncertainties in their lives, just as I do.</p>\n<p>Certain artists such as The National, Billy Joel, The Smiths and Van Morrison hold immense power in helping me pinpoint the core of my anxious feelings considering that at times, I feel as if they’re writing songs about my life instead of theirs. I personally believe that it’s insanely important for people (especially those suffering from anxiety) to identify the artists that move them and influence their emotions in a way that makes them feel less alone. My anxiety always fades away when I realize that I’m not alone in feeling the way I do, and what better way is there to feel this way than to simply listen to music?</p>\n<p>–– Sam Sakamoto</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Music has helped me live for at least the past ten years. It’s a medium that’s unique in its promise of total privacy; when you’re walking alone with headphones in, there is no one in the world who knows what’s in your mind. This escape saved my life as a kid, as a teenager and as a young adult  more times than I can count.</p>\n<p>When I was little, five or six, I would bury my face in the pillow upon waking and mash my closed eyes into the fabric, seeing which shapes I could make. I don’t do this anymore, but I listen to music. It is very much a pillow. It has a way of making the pit inside you seem scalable, realer and therefore less scary. It helps the <em>you</em> part feel real, too. Stronger. More there<em>.</em></p>\n<p>I’ve struggled with depression on and off since I was 12. Depression — it’s part of a conversation now and more accepted than ever before. But it wasn’t back then. Depression had nothing to do with neglect and serotonin and cycles and medicine, but it did have everything to do with Thom Yorke moaning, “I’m not here / This isn’t happening.” When you have nothing to hold onto, the voice in your ear becomes your world. Everything after that was colored by the strange richness I felt knowing that someone else shared that feeling of dissociation. I felt the words and sounds inside my brain: they were mine. I carried them into the day.</p>\n<p>A couple months ago, during spring break, I went to a U.S. Girls concert in San Francisco. It was at a tiny club — Rickshaw Stop. By the time Meg Remy took the stage, it was packed. For over an hour, she wove a stratosphere of feeling. The place was purple with love. I don’t know how she did it, and I don’t remember every song. What I do remember is the final 10-minute jam, when she kneeled at the edge of the stage and put her hand out into the void, looking at everyone at once, saying, “I love you. I care about you. I love you.”</p>\n<p>–– Andre Bouyssounouse</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83302\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/music-and-me/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83302\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/music-and-me/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/music-and-me/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/music-and-me/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/music-and-me/","id":6643,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6642,6641,6640],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tracks of the Month: April 2018","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/TOTM-Cotton-Candy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/TOTM-Cotton-Candy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"From Aminé and Injury Reserve to A$AP Rocky, April brought an assortment of energetic, eccentric and thoughtful hip hop tracks.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aminé feat.

Aminé’s catchy expression is found within the repeated chorus lines, “That’s my lil’ bitch, that’s-that’s my lil’ bitch.” Despite the track only lasting a little more than two minutes, the song ascends into a smooth fervor that garnered attention from subreddits claiming the single hinted at a slight Brockhampton diss. Although Injury Reserve denied this, the unlikely collaboration between the rap trio that experiments with tight instrumentals and  a rapper who is known for his earworm hooks proved that two vastly different artists from the rap spectrum can come together and create a brilliant, sparkling track.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NO3k6kqbKGs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kali Uchis, “Body Language – Intro”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kali Uchis’ debut album was quite impressive, by measure of both cohesiveness and quality of sound.

While Rich Brian is known for his humble and amicable personality, his lyricism would make you think otherwise, constantly raising his status with appealing flow.

Boastful verses and synthy beats accompanied by a delicate string section and piano create a sound which comes off as both ancient and incredibly modern. A sample from Moby’s “Porcelain” and soothing vocals from Khloe Anna close out the dynamic composition which juggles each distinct element with ease. Released with an equally stimulating and trippy music video, “A$AP Forever” is A$AP’s first big step into the realm of musical legends.</span></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNzc6hG3yN4</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82936\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/tracks-of-the-month-april-2018/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82936\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/tracks-of-the-month-april-2018/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/tracks-of-the-month-april-2018/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/tracks-of-the-month-april-2018/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/tracks-of-the-month-april-2018/","id":6642,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6641,6640,6639],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Artsweek’s Favorite Albums of 2016","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-01-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BlondeCover_grande.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BlondeCover_grande.jpg?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1","description":"All in all, 2016 was one hell of a year.

And, as with any particularly tumultuous time, it left us with some amazing music. In this special end-of-year list, the Artsweek staff reflects on some of our favorites. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Emotion: Side B</i></b><b> by Carly Rae Jepsen</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion Side B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the “Call Me Maybe” singer shifted from guilty pleasure pop anthems to complex stories disguised in ’80s pop arrangements. Jepsen channels the complexities of a love-struck mind into song, creating a colorful haven that is welcoming to all. Although these are unused songs from Jepsen’s 2015 project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, these B-sides highlight a sincerity in modern pop music that is often diluted, or even completely lost. With the guidance of indie-heavy hitters Dev Hynes and Greg Kurstin, Jepsen made a project full of melancholic songs that could instantly become the soundtrack to the next independent coming-of-age film. The track “Cry” accentuates the downfalls of unrequited love with inviting synths, no doubt an influence from Hynes. The disco pulse radiating from the ’80s in “Body Language” had people singing the chorus in the shower in a matter of time. There is no need to put your Spotify on a private session when listening to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion: Side B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; this is an album that no one should feel guilty about listening to. Jepsen deserves more recognition for her ability to transform from one-hit wonder status to the same realm as imaginative indie-pop artists like Sky Ferreira. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Rodriguez</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service </i></b><b>by A Tribe Called Quest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legendary jazz-rap maestros A Tribe Called Quest reunite for their swan song with their first album in 18 years, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The group’s sound has aged like a fine wine, and their influence is all over the modern rap game, which is full of jazzy beats and lyrics that celebrate blackness. The group even acknowledges this on the song “Dis Generation” which passes the torch from the old guard to the new vanguard of hip-hop music shouting out “Joey, Earl, Kendrick and Cole.” Another example of the group’s sound being perfect for 2016 is the politically charged lead single, “We The People….” With divisions between people being a huge part of the rhetoric of the last election season, this track fights back emphatically. The chorus, for example, rails against the rhetoric of people like Donald Trump who believe that black, Mexican, Muslim and gay people are “bad folks” who “must go.” A Tribe Called Quest instead sells a message of unity with the track from the opening lyric, “We don’t believe you ’cause we the people,” by drawing on the language of our constitution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the standout tracks, it’s impossible to talk about the album without mentioning the recent passing of founding member Phife Dawg in March. The group does an amazing job celebrating the life of The Five-Footer throughout the album by incorporating Phife’s raps recorded before his death and the emotionally charged tribute, “Lost Somebody.” As Tribe calls it quits with their final album, don’t feel that you’ve lost a great rap group; instead, celebrate that they went out with a banger. As for Phife Dawg, “he’s in sunshine.”</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Splendor &amp; Misery </i></b><b>by clipping</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The experimental, noise-rap trio led by 2016 Tony Award winner and frontman Daveed Diggs is back with one of the strangest releases of the year. According to their label, Sub Pop, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Splendor &amp; Misery</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an Afrofuturist, dystopian concept album that follows the sole survivor of a slave uprising on an interstellar cargo ship and the onboard computer that falls in love with him. If that doesn’t sound like a unique album, then I don’t know what does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thematically, clipping analyzes blackness in the modern age by catapulting it into the future and the past at the same time. The protagonist, the slave from the future Cargo 2311, comforts himself by rapping over the clangs and buzzes of the spaceship itself, and this is reflected beautifully by William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes’s instrumentation that transport the listener to the noisy ship perfectly. The album makes many allusions to the past through choral renditions of African-American slave spirituals and tackles universal themes of loneliness and existentialism as the main character suffers anxiety and depression as a result of constantly feeling on-the-run. These futuristic ideas have a basis in our modern age, but the Cargo 2331 passenger comforts himself by reasserting his roots through rap music and slave spirituals. This is reflected in today’s America, where black artists are reasserting their identity through their music in an environment that can feel hopeless with systemic injustices. </span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Blackstar</i></b><b> by David Bowie</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Bowie did something amazing with his final album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Of course, it is his last album because he sadly passed away in January. However, what is truly remarkable about Bowie as an artist is that he used the pain of the cancer he eventually succumbed to and awareness of his own mortality to make his art. With </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he solidifies his nearly 50-year legacy as one of the most unique artists of the last century. Not only is the subject matter innovative and unique as Bowie explores his own death, but it’s a testament to Bowie’s constant evolution as an artist that this album sounds very distinct from his previous work. He fully embraces jazz experimentalism with this album, despite being a rock legend. Additionally, with Bowie being older, he has adapted his music to highlight his weathered voice by focusing on the timbre of his vocals and the haunting mood that they create throughout the album. Overall, this album was a legendary send-off for a legendary man and artist. As Bowie tells his fans and loved ones on the song, “Dollar Days,” “Don’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you.” And we won’t forget you either. Rest in peace, Starman.</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Blonde </i></b><b>by Frank Ocean</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most anticipated album of the year, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the follow-up to Ocean’s acclaimed 2012 debut into alternative R&amp;B stardom, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">channel ORANGE</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. On this album, Ocean continues doing what we love him for: being himself. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">features Ocean bearing his heart and soul on his sleeve as he sings about unrequited love, depression and other events from his life. The project features some of the most emotionally charged vocals and lyrics of the year as Ocean’s raw humanity shines through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the intensity of emotion and imagery throughout the album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is rather minimal. So minimal, you might not notice that Beyoncé, perhaps the most well-known modern pop artist, sings background vocals on “Pink + White” or any of the other understated features including sad Swedish rapper Yung Lean on “Self Control.” And that’s without mentioning the myriad of other artists on the album including James Blake and Pharrell Williams. This style allows Ocean’s voice to take center stage without wasting any energy on superfluous instrumentation. However, there is one feature that stands out above the rest: André 3000 on “Solo (Reprise).” André 3000 brought so much energy in his one-minute-long feature that people are begging him for a new album. This is for good reason, as “Solo (Reprise)” was, in this writer’s opinion, the best guest feature of 2016. This moment of intensity does well to inject energy into the album while keeping the focus on Ocean’s minimal style that pervades the other tracks. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have taken a while to finally come out, but any Frank Ocean fan will tell you that the wait was worth it, as he released one of the best records of the year.</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>ROCKISDEAD</i></b><b> by Dorothy</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They may have named their album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROCKISDEAD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but in 35 minutes the members of Dorothy prove that rock remains alive and thriving. Old school without feeling overdone, the quartet’s debut record comes packed with infectious clapping beats, blues-inspired guitar riffs and even hints of country all centered around lead singer Dorothy Martin’s powerhouse vocals. Even if you can’t quite belt with the same ferocity as Martin, it’s hard to resist singing along with her hooks. So go ahead and put on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROCKISDEAD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> next time you’re on a drive; wail your heart out about what a wild and reckless rock star you are. </span></p>\n<p>— Melanie Voskanian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Teens Of Denial</i></b><b> by Car Seat Headrest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirteen albums in, Will Toledo and the rest of Car Seat Headrest show no signs of winding down. In fact, with their latest release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they’ve only picked up speed, so buckle up and take a listen. Appearing on multiple music publications’ best-of-2016 lists, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succeeds in its ability to make you feel okay with not being okay. The record offers an honest take on often-heavy topics including clinical depression, but the music never strays into cynicism, maintaining positive and hopeful sounds throughout. If you’re looking for a feel-good take on the low points in life or even just some catchy lo-fi rock tunes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is waiting for you.</span></p>\n<p>— Melanie Voskanian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>City Club </i></b><b>by The Growlers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of the twisted beach carnival vibe created in The Growlers’ </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot Tropics, City Club</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels more like watching a five-piece downtown Vegas casino house band while peaking on acid, Raoul Duke style. In lieu of Sinatra covers, they’re playing “I’ll Be Around,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and it’s a little confusing, but there’s nothing wrong with being disoriented sometimes. That is what is so special about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">City Club </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to me. While 2016 has been a time of questionable changes and uncertainty, The Growlers keep it fresh while staying true to their roots. It’s fun, romantic, weird and different from anything else out there. The Growlers are a comforting reminder that all hope isn’t lost. In a genre that has become increasingly derivative, no one else can even do a quality job at ripping them off. With the aptly titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">City Club,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Growlers move away from the surf rock stylings that made up the bulk of their work. Tunes like “Beach Rats” and “Burden of the Captain,” which previously defined their style now morph into “Night Ride” and “Rubber and Bone.” This transition hasn’t happened all at once and doesn’t isolate die-hard Beach Goth festival fans. It’s a diversification of The Growlers, and it’s rad.</span></p>\n<p>— Sean Edwards</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>A Moon Shaped Pool </i></b><b>by Radiohead</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English alternative lords Radiohead released their ninth studio album in 2016, and it was a gentle reminder that they are still relevant and ever-powerful influencers of music culture. Entitled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the album is an ethereal blend of soft droning melodies and piercing lyrics that evoke such profound emotion from mundane words. Thom Yorke has always had a unique ability to speak simply but wholly capture exactly what you’re feeling. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does this just as well as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK Computer </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bends, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and worms its way into your mind. It relates itself to everything that’s been swirling around your brain, getting deeper with every play. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels like classic Radiohead: a little inaccessible, but that’s the point. There isn’t a Radiohead album that is immediately easily digestible; they all require active thought to really enjoy. Just like jogging through a museum, a half-assed listen may leave you confused and a little sweaty. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reveals something new or makes you feel something different with every listen. It becomes a distorted reflection of internal processes, and Yorke’s blunt lyrics still leave room for creation of your own context. Radiohead once again slipped under our skin and delivered 11 tracks to make us think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Sean Edwards</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Malibu</i></b><b> by Anderson .Paak</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hip hop fans have been waiting for Anderson .Paak for a long time. For years, we have been left struggling to prove the true musicality and talent required to excel in our beloved art form. We could point to Kendrick Lamar for his lyrical wizardry, or Dr. Dre and his command of modern technology in production, but there was no one with undeniable musical greatness. With the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the live shows that followed, Anderson .Paak has changed all of that. A Grammy nominated album recorded on an old laptop and dented microphone, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> features a mix of soulful singing and rapping over instrument-based beats with samples from the likes Hiatus Kaiyote or fully original tunes curated by .Paak and his longtime band, The Free Nationals. Additionally, .Paak is completely redefining the standard of hip-hop live shows. While many rappers only feature a hypeman and a DJ, .Paak’s live show is music being played almost entirely live. Paak himself brings an unmatched energy with his bold personality, quirky outfits and astounding drumming capabilities (these aren’t Bieber drum fills, they’re jazz fills!). At the end of 2016, .Paak, The Free Nationals and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have brought some much-needed funk and soul pizazz to hip hop all the while raising the bar for what it means to be a performer.</span></p>\n<p>— Daniel Carroll</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Cardinal</i></b><b> by Pinegrove</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The natural inclination of people in their late teens and early twenties is to be apathetic. Whether it’s a dead-end job, rough times in school or even a hangover, there will always be a mild feeling of dislike within close reach. Pinegrove, folk-punk’s latest prodigy, captures this feeling with both wit and self-awareness on their debut, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardinal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “How come every outcome is such a comedown?” lead singer Evan Stephens Hall sings in a tone both sardonic and earnest on the lead track “New Friends.” The exact genre of Pinegrove’s music is hard to pinpoint, dipping into the sensibilities of modern pop-punk, toying with elements of folk and even hinting at a country twang. Music’s current state is one that has no boundaries, and this is a band that is aware of the greatness this can bring. </span></p>\n<p>— Zoe Jones</p>\n<p><b><i>Holy Ghost</i></b><b> by Modern Baseball</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Split between lead singers Brendan Lukens and Jake Ewald, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holy Ghost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an 11-track confrontation of depression, loss and past loves. If you listen to the album on shuffle, the two frontmen act as a foil to one another. Ewald’s side is bold, while Lukens’ side is dark. Ewald grew up in a religious household, so tinges of those memories appear in his lyrics at times, most apparent in his wry mention of a girl who is “sipping from that holy cup.” Lukens’ mental health battles are approached directly, “always looking back on my mistakes and others’,” he sings at one point. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holy Ghost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the band’s third album, and their growth is clear in the way they continuously dig deeper into themselves without over-exploiting their own struggles. </span></p>\n<p>— Zoe Jones</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74665\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74665\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/","id":6784,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6783,6782,6781],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/667"}},"__N_SSG":true}
