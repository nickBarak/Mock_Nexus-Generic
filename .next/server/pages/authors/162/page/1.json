Najera will focus her discussion on how undocumented students are engaging in activism in the public education system.</p>\n<p>Najera said students should be aware of minority groups on and around campus.</p>\n<p>“If we want to be informed and engaged in our society, we cannot ignore our neighbors and what they might be going through,” Najera said. “It is important for UCSB students to know who is in their community, what issues, politics these people are facing and the situation they are in to help us make better choices.”</p>\n<p>MCC publicist and marketing coordinator Carol Dinh said Najera’s talk aims to create a safe atmosphere for students to discuss undocumented students’ challenges.</p>\n<p>“This lecture in particular will help bring more attention to the status of undocumented students at our university, with the aim of creating a safe space where students can ask questions and learn how to be proactive to defend the right to education for all young people,” Dinh said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we want to be informed and engaged in our society, we cannot ignore our neighbors and what they might be going through. – UC Riverside Professor Jennifer Najera</p></blockquote>\n<p>Only five to 10 percent of undocumented students graduating high school have the opportunity to attend a university, and even fewer receive financial aid, according to Dinh.</p>\n<p>“[These students] are an integral part of our campus … and are a marginalized group that are ‘unseen,’ as their status is often times kept private,” Dinh said.</p>\n<p>Najera said undocumented students are diligent in educating themselves and others about their cause.</p>\n<p>“What I have seen in my research is that they are actively creating learning experiences outside their classrooms,” Najera said. “They are involved on an everyday level and on education projects, whether it be educating themselves about immigration policies or ways they could be participating in the community to educating other people.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major Isabel Czarnecki said undocumented students have the same right to education as their native-born peers.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great cause because even if you aren’t documented, everyone deserves a right to an education,” Czarnecki said. “I don’t think their citizenship should declare the education they can or cannot get.”</p>\n<p>Dinh said the MCC hopes students who attend the talk will leave with a different perspective on undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“We hope that by exposing students to the adversities faced by undocumented students that they can slowly begin to shift and shape their world view and language,” Dinh said.</p>\n<p>According to Dinh, the MCC created the Race Matters series to educate students on the challenges their classmates may be facing.</p>\n<p>“Race Matters is a series of interactive discussions that probe or explore issues related to race on a deeper level and examines its continued impact on marginalized communities within larger societal structures,” Dinh said. “The MCC hopes to broaden awareness and contribute to an ongoing dialogue and reflection on important issues.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

During the forum, attendees discussed ways to help students overcome dining obstacles and more easily obtain groceries.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students Food Bank Chair Katie Freeze, one of the main goals of the Food Bank is not just to feed the struggling students, but to focus on providing healthy, nutritious food, and finding solutions to problems such as grocery store accessibility.</p>\n<p>“The Food Bank exists as a service because students are struggling to make ends meet. The purpose of this forum is to help students become self-sufficient and be able to feed themselves,” Freeze said. “The Food Bank is a holistic service. We’re trying to make sure students have healthy food and know where it comes from.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>A lot of people aren’t aware of student hunger; it’s always kept on the down low. – Food Bank Chair Katie Freeze</p></blockquote>\n<p>Freeze said many students on campus suffer from hunger and the forum hopes to educate students on how to combat it and allow attendees to share their thoughts in establishing short and long-term goals.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people aren’t aware of student hunger; it’s always kept on the down low,” Freeze said. “The Forum empowers students who are personally facing hunger or encourages those who want to make a difference … Our long term goals are improving access to farmers markets and transportation to grocery stores.”</p>\n<p>According to sustainability coordinator of UCSB’s Department of Geography Katie Maynard, UCSB Sustainability wants to unite all the different groups and departments on campus to discuss food programs that occur on campus. Maynard said the goal is for all sustainability, environment and food groups to serve as a coalition rather than individual organizations.</p>\n<p>“[We are] a sustainability coalition rather than individual organizations,” Maynard said. “UCSB Sustainability is trying to create a web that happens throughout the different programs that happen on campus. [We want to] develop collective goals across the different departments and with the feedback, incorporate into the new sustainability plan.”</p>\n<p>Vice Chair of the A.S. Food Bank Committee Erick Lankey said the food bank is just one of many resources for students on campus. Lankey said instead of working to expand the organization, the food bank wants to combine with other departments to provide a wider variety of services to students in need.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to be the highlight, there are other resources that are needed in our space, not just pure distribution of food,” Lankey said. “The idea of a food bank is a good idea, but in an ideal world, we don’t want to exist. We want to have this but also combine with other departments [to focus] for total well-being. We want to become deeper rather than expand bigger.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>They should have a broader range of choices. Students are used to eating crappy food, but what they have chance to grow and prep their food, their diets change. Just asking what people want is not a valid measure of the potential. – Environmental Studies Professor David Cleveland</p></blockquote>\n<p>During the forum, attendees broke off into groups to discuss various short and long-term goals for the campus. Environmental Studies Professor David Cleveland said the UCen should focus more on providing healthy options rather than profit.</p>\n<p>“UCen dining is restricting what they can sell [and] got rid of some healthy alternative on campus because they are competing with the dining services,” Cleveland said. “The University isn’t providing them the support first generation college students need. Resources aren’t following student demographics and there is a shortage of support for those students, which relates to their inability to get healthy food.”</p>\n<p>Cleveland said asking students about their food preferences does not always lead to healthier dining support plans.</p>\n<p>“They should have a broader range of choices. Students are used to eating crappy food, but what they have chance to grow and prep their food, their diets change,” Cleveland said. “Just asking what people want is not a valid measure of the potential.”</p>\n<p>According to Cleveland, “pressure can change policy,” meaning the only way to incite change is by fighting for it as he did years ago when the University wanted to eliminate the campus gardens in favor of new housing for graduate students.</p>\n<p>“In 2000, [the school] wanted to eliminate [the campus] gardens and there was no alternative,” Cleveland said. “They would do all sorts of stuff to manipulate us so that we don’t oppose it, but all of a sudden, at the planning meeting, the Vice Chancellor of Facilities said they would put the graduate housing somewhere else instead.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62559\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62559\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/","id":2795,"author":{"id":162,"name":"Kelly Lin"},"related":[2794,2793,2792],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"County Officials To Meet Students at Selective Event","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students will have the chance to meet with all five County Supervisors and the County Executive Officer at an event called “Day at the County,” which is hosted by Associated Students and will run ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Students will have the chance to meet with all five County Supervisors and the County Executive Officer at an event called “Day at the County,” which is hosted by Associated Students and will run tomorrow from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at the Santa Barbara County Administration Building downtown.</p>\n<p>Organized by the A.S. Office of the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA), the event will simultaneously educate students about local affairs while providing them with the opportunity to build relationships with elected officials. Students will not only learn about current issues in Santa Barbara but can also pose questions to local government leaders concerning matters particularly relevant to UCSB students, such as infrastructure in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>UCSB Associated Students EVPLA Alex Moore said the event gives students an important opportunity to voice their concerns about local issues, as students represent a large portion of the population in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“We contribute a lot as UCSB students, and it’s important for county leaders to hear what students have to say about local issues and the community here,” Moore said. “Things that happen on local levels can really affect the lives of the students. County leadership is the main government body that affects Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Moore said the event will hopefully demonstrate to students the impact of local affairs work and subsequently encourage students to become more involved with the affairs of the community.</p>\n<p>“More engaged students and more engaged civic members is a better community,” Moore said. “It gives students the tools to give their stance, come up with ideas and be able to represent themselves.”</p>\n<p>According to the EVPLA office County Liaison Maile Hartsook, the planning process for this event goes back to October, when she and Moore began organizing for it.</p>\n<p>The organizers completed a campus-wide call for applications and Hartsook said attendees, who were chosen through the application process, make up a diverse group of individuals such as transfer students, minority students and members of the Greek system.</p>\n<p>In addition, all of the students will have attended trainings in preparation for the event. The preparatory training, Hartsook said, will hopefully enable students and county leaders to recognize and become aware of each other’s needs.</p>\n<p>“I am very excited for ‘Day at the County,’ especially because it is the first of its kind,” Hartsook said. “It is meant to be a learning opportunity for both … The officials will learn what local issues are important to the UCSB community, and students will gain an insight into local politics.”</p>\n<p>First District Supervisor and UCSB alumnus Salud Carbajal said he is looking forward to communicating with students and viewing issues from their respective perspectives, so he can potentially foster longer-lasting relationships with the student body.</p>\n<p>“I hope the students will get an opportunity to communicate with the county government the most important issues at the campus,” Carbajal said. “We are county decision makers so we want to best form a partnership.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal also said he encourages students to openly voice their opinions, saying he hopes they will introduce ideas and points of discussion that will potentially improve “the quality of life in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>“You can never go wrong with working on a relationship and having good communication between local government issues and students who are responsible for shaping the campus policies,” Carbajal said. “I’m really looking forward to the exchange. I was a UCSB student once upon a time, so I understand the campus life.”</p>\n<p>Fourth District Supervisor Peter Adam said he will be answering student questions regarding finances and added that he looks forward to the exchange and the ideas that will come from it.</p>\n<p>“I want to fill in some gaps from [the students], especially if we can have a good discussion on economics, government spending and maintenance priorities,” Adam said. “Hopefully, students will understand that they should expect a lot from their politicians.”<br>\nA version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/","id":3048,"author":{"id":162,"name":"Kelly Lin"},"related":[3047,3046,3045],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/162"}},"__N_SSG":true}
