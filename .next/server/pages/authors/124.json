The fraternity seeks to establish a chapter on campus to appeal to pre-med students, despite the presence of Mu Delta, a pre-existing pre-med fraternity that has been on campus since 2011, as well as Rho Psi Eta, UCSB’s pre-health sorority, established 2007.</p>\n<p>According to Amy Tsang, Vice President of PhiDE Recruitment and second-year biopsychology major, the fraternity is unique because it is the only co-ed pre-medical organization on campus, differentiating it from all-male Mu Delta and all-female Rho Psi Eta, and includes pre-medical and medical school students.</p>\n<p>“We’re unique to UCSB in the way that we have medical school fraternities, as well as pre-medical school fraternities,” Tsang said in an email. “This means we have a strong alumni network, as well as tied to medical schools across the nation!”</p>\n<p>PhiDE president and third-year cell and developmental biology major Mimi Xu said the fraternity provides members benefits after graduation from college, including assistance in choosing a specialty and finding residency training.</p>\n<p>“We hope this fraternity prepares premeds for medical school by offering many resources such as volunteering and internship opportunities, guest speakers, academic help, etc.,” Xu said in an email.  “We also hope members will create lifelong friendships with people who have the same goals and aspirations, and have a supportive network of people when things get tough.”</p>\n<p>According to PhiDE Vice President of Programming and second-year biology major Kevin Le, the new chapter will require 25 students to join to form the founding class, and there are tentative plans to hold the first rush in the fall quarter of 2015.</p>\n<p>“Students looking to join this fraternity should be ready for a challenge, but a worthwhile challenge,” Le said in an email.  “Joining a new fraternity on campus and building it up from the ground is definitely something that is not easy. However, the potential growth and lifetime bonds you could develop from doing so is what makes it worth it and so exciting.”</p>\n<p>Carl Provenzano, Inter-Fraternity Council president and fourth-year biopsychology major, said PhiDE will offer pre-med students a great way for students to get involved.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great to bring out groups that tend to different demographics,” Provenzano said. “And it’s coed and it targets the medical students.

Barnes has written various books on the economy, including <em>Who Owns the Sky, Capitalism 3.0</em> and <em>With Liberty and Dividends for All: How to Save Our Middle Class When Jobs Don’t Pay Enough.</em></p>\n<p>Barnes said he believes in fixing capitalism rather than destroying it and that solutions to reforming capitalism boil involve addressing capitalism’s two “tragic” flaws.  </p>\n<p>“The relentless destruction of nature and the equally relentless widening of inequality,” Barnes said. “These flaws are coded into the system. If we want to change them we have to change the system itself, and it’s not enough to fiddle at the edges.”</p>\n<p>According to Barnes, reforming capitalism is an urgent affair that must be addressed on a systematic level.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really have any time left to fiddle at the edges,” Barnes said. “We have to get to the fundamental systematic roots of these flaws and fix them.”</p>\n<p>Barnes also said capitalism’s flaws can be addressed by arguing against the idea that “the commons,” or community owned resources, are inherently self-destructive. This idea was originally proposed by late UCSB human ecology professor Garrett Hardin, according to Barnes. </p>\n<p>“The commons is not the perpetrator of tragedy but rather the victim and capitalism’s tragic flaws are the actual perpetrators, and that the commons, or what I now prefer to call common wealth, is actually a key part of the solution to the flaws of capitalism,” Barnes said.  </p>\n<p>According to Barnes, in order to fix the “deepest flaws of capitalism,” individuals need to “reclaim the commons,” or common wealth, by organizing and managing the commons on the basis of common ownership, common trustee ship and common benefit. Barnes also said he encouraged audience members to prepare for “the next crisis” by sharing his ideas regarding the commonwealth in writing and online. </p>\n<p>“Start saying things like, ‘The air belongs to all of us,’ or ‘Our money belongs to all of us. Our monetary system belongs to all of us. And they are taking it from us and we have a right to take it back.’” Barnes said. “Start naming common wealth and claiming it. If we do that I do believe that after the next crisis, we can fix the tragic flaws of capitalism.”<br>\n <br>\nEvent organizer and philosophy professor Gregory Jarrett said Barnes’ talk relates to one of his classes on environmental ethics. </p>\n<p>“This is relevant to my class on environmental ethics, but also as you will hear it is part of our mission to bring in other classes,” Jarrett said.  “They are also very excited, they are also talking about the same kind of things in different compartments, and this is our opportunity to get things together.”</p>\n<p>Students in Jarrett’s Environmental Ethics class, professor Robert Wilkinson’s Sustainable Communities, professor Philip McCarty’s Global Economic Development and his Global Studies 1 class were attendance at the lecture.    </p>\n<p>Jarrett said the event aims to bring together students with different majors to listen and talk with Barnes. </p>\n<p>“The goal is to get the students from different disciplines together in the same room not only hear him talk,” Jarrett said.  “But there will be a 30 minute Q and A so they get an opportunity to interact with a speaker like this.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year religious studies and physical geography double major Harlowe Wang said she enjoyed listening to Barnes’ ideas, but also does not see how they could be applied to the real world.</p>\n<p> “I think he was extending human stakeholders that are alive now too far to future generations and to non-human stakeholders,” Wang said.  “I thought his idea was amazing and I think it was very interesting and thought provoking [but] I wished he had spoken more to the actual feasibility and politics of it, because what I’ve taken away from is that its a really great idea … but I still don’t see how it would been implemented.”</p>\n<p>Following the lecture and question and answer segment, there was a book signing of Barnes’ With Liberty and Dividends for All: How to Save Our Middle Class When Jobs Don’t Pay Enough, which was available for purchase at the talk. </p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/","id":2959,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[2958,2957,2956],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet and KCSB News Director Monica Lopez will co-edit an anthology with a working title of <em>I.V. Strong Collaboration: Looking Beyond</em> <em>May 23rd, 2014</em>.</p>\n<p>The anthology may be in the form of an e-book or a hardcopy, and the coeditors are in the process of finding a publisher. Submissions can be in the form of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, articles, essays, visual art, photography, videography, monologues, images or screenshots of text conversations. Submissions can be anonymous or include a credit or title and must be submitted with a completed signed contribution release form to be reviewed for publication in the anthology.</p>\n<p>Scarlet said the anthology would cover the positive reactions by the Isla Vista community that occurred in the wake of the killings.</p>\n<p>“There were so many amazing things that happened in such a tragic moment, like the paddle-out and the chalk on the sidewalks, and we didn’t let [the tragedy] keep us down,” Scarlet said. “We love how beautiful that was in how we all came together and we wanted to show the world how we reacted.”</p>\n<p>According to Scarlet, the anthology will give a platform for the uplifting memories and actions not conveyed through mainstream media coverage of May 23.</p>\n<p>“You know watching the media and news, none of that was portrayed,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>Marquez said she wants the anthology to provide support to others who are still coping with the tragedy.</p>\n<p>“As a researcher, I tried to find some guidance from other folks, and there really wasn’t anything like this,” Márquez said. “In a way I want to offer it for anyone in the future, whoever finds themselves in this type of situation.”</p>\n<p>According to Lopez, the anthology would function as a collaborative creation to memorialize the victims and serve as an avenue for “people choose to heal and grieve through a creative process.”</p>\n<p>“There have been lots of photos created, there was the memorial wall created by A.S. and all of those smaller collective expressions that were really beautiful and powerful and healing for a lot of people,” Lopez said. “I think the thinking is to have a place to put it all together and share it with everybody and sort have a place to go to.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said she is primarily expecting local participation for the anthology but is open to outside submissions.</p>\n<p>“I think because we are focusing on our local networks in the Santa Barbara and Isla Vista area, that is who we are hoping will contribute,” Lopez said. “They have most of the source materials, photos, spoken word pieces, poetry and what they have already created or what they will create to express themselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Márquez, the anthology is for people who want to creatively express themselves or who already have a piece they would like to share.</p>\n<p>“This is a callout to some people who want to write something down, to the other people who will already have something that they want to share,” Márquez said.</p>\n<p>Márquez said she hopes that when people see the anthology it will engender a positive emotional reaction by demonstrating the diversity of the community’s healing process.</p>\n<p>“When someone just randomly picks [the anthology] up, I think it will give anyone who reads it the feeling of hope, the feeling that there are all these multi-faceted ways, that everyone feels differently doing different things and creating community in different ways,” Márquez said.</p>\n<p><em>According to the </em>I.V.

The opening ceremony will be held in Girvetz Hall, large committees will be in the Theater &amp; Dance Building, small committees will be in the Student Resource Building and the closing ceremony will be in Isla Vista Theater.</p>\n<p>According to SBIMUN Security Council Chair and fourth-year political science and Italian double major Jane Huson, their event is relatively new compared to those held at other universities and will provide students with good preparation for future MUN conferences.</p>\n<p>“Our conference is pretty new and more of an educational one since it is hosted in the fall and a lot of colleges send newer delegates so they can experience it in a less intimidating environment,” Huson said. “A lot of students will go to the New York MUN in the spring and the Berkeley MUN in the winter so this is a jumping off point for the students.”</p>\n<p>The number of travel conferences MUN will be able to attend depends on how much funding they collect from hosting home conferences. The team is planning to attend conferences in New York, Davis, Berkeley and Los Angeles this school year.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN Human Rights Council and third-year global studies Benjamin Pu said the conference will be a great learning opportunity for many students.</p>\n<p>“This is a great training conference, and for many schools it will be the first conference of the year,” Pu said. “We provide a thorough and rigorous environment for rules and procedures and also emphasize educational aspects as well.”</p>\n<p>Huson said around 400 to 450 delegates from 18 universities throughout California are expected to be at the conference, including UC San Diego, UC Davis, University of Southern California and Stanford University.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN World Food Program and first-year pre-economics Jason Tsao said he looks forward to the event.</p>\n<p>“This is my first time chairing for a MUN conference and even though it’s going to be a long three days, I’m excited,” Tsao said. “There are training sessions held weekly and that’s where delegates will learn what to do at the conferences.”</p>\n<p>According to Huson, there will be four committee sessions spread out over three days with the opening ceremony introducing chairs, committees and a guest speaker. Each committee will have two topics for discussion and will be chaired by MUN students.</p>\n<p>Huson said MUN members can learn how to be better delegates through hosting a conference.</p>\n<p>“Conferences are super helpful because students are chairing and facilitating the debates,” Huson said. “Chairs who are members will see what makes people good delegates so when they go to travel conferences they can know how to better behave and win prizes and learn what goes into writing a good resolution.”</p>\n<p>MUN will host two more annual conferences, the Gaucho Model United Nations High School Conference and the Central Coast Scrimmage, on Feb. 14-15 and May 2 respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58011\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58011\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/","id":2306,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[2305,2304,2303],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/124"}},"__N_SSG":true}
