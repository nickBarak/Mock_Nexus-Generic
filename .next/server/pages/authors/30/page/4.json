Gov Gavin Newsom proposed a 14-point plan to aid student-athletes academically.</p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara attained a student-athlete graduation success rate of 82 percent in the 2014-2015 school year, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) website. The graduation success rate takes into account student-athletes who leave UCSB in good standing or graduate elsewhere.</p>\n<p>UCSB already has many of the policies called for in Newsom’s proposal, which would require that athletes who sustain career-ending injuries be able to retain their scholarships until graduation.</p>\n<p>The plan would also prevent coaches from having the authority to deny or admit student-athletes and limit practice time to no more than 20 hours a week.</p>\n<p>Additionally, administrations on UC campuses would have increased involvement in athletic departments and student-athletes would be required to meet with academic counselors regularly if the plan passes.</p>\n<p>Bill Mahoney, UCSB associate athletics director of communications, said each team decides if student-athletes keep their scholarships after sustaining career-ending injuries. He said the UCSB athletics department does not currently mandate this decision for all teams.</p>\n<p>Mahoney also said UCSB coaches have no say in admissions decisions for student-athletes. Freshman student-athletes are required to meet with academic counselors and each team requires its student-athletes to attend study halls on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The athletics department abides by the NCAA rule limiting team practices to a maximum of 20 hours per week, according to Mahoney. Practices can exceed this limit, he said, only when school is not in session.</p>\n<p>While he recognized that many UC campuses are currently implementing many of the proposed policies, Newsom said the UC system should “lead the nation in reform” with his 14-point plan.</p>\n<p>“A lot of this is already being done, so it’s nice to codify it,” Newsom said.<br>\nGabe Vincent, a guard on UCSB’s basketball team and second-year religious studies major, said he and other student-athletes struggle to balance school and sports despite many of these policies aimed at upholding athletes’ academic performance.</p>\n<p>Vincent said he often worries that he will not graduate in four years, especially since he feels forced by his schedule to take only 12 or 13 units each quarter.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s definitely a worry,” Vincent said. “You’re expected to put the same amount of work and same amount of time [into school], but there’s a big block of your day that’s just taken out.”</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-70557\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Del Playa” seems to some a mistranslation of “to the beach,” which is “de la playa” in Spanish. <em>McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Fernanda Cerrato, a second-year political science major, moved into her apartment on Cordoba Road in September 2015, she could not help but notice the seemingly incorrect</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Spanish in many of the surrounding street names—“Del Playa” appeared to her an incorrect version of “de la playa,” which means “to the beach” in Spanish.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cerrato was born in Sonora, Mexico, and moved to a Mexican-American neighborhood of Oxnard, Calif. at 14. She now notices when people pronounce “El Colegio” with a hard “g” instead of the “h” sound used by native Spanish-speakers.</span></p>\n<p>“Everyone knew how to pronounce things in Spanish” in Oxnard, Cerrato said. “People here don’t try whatsoever to pronounce the names correctly.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bad Spanish seems to be abundant in Isla Vista’s street names, and historians say that these mistranslated titles are the work of I.V.’s earliest developers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landowners Pauline and John Ilharreguy built and named the four major streets that run parallel to the bluffs — Del Playa Drive, Sabado Tarde Road, Trigo Road and Pasado Road — in 1925.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spanish street names and “Isla Vista” were intended to keep with the Spanish colonial theme then in use by much of Santa Barbara as it rebuilt itself following the 1925 earthquake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several I.V. historians agree that the Ilharreguys were probably not good at Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista” is Spanish for Island View, but is not grammatically correct, and “Sabado Tarde” was supposed to mean “Saturday afternoon,” but Spanish-speakers typically say “Sabado por la tarde.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historians also find “Pasado” to be an odd choice. Had the Ilharreguys chosen “Pasada,” the name would have meant “passage,” but the “o” at the end changed the meaning to “overripe” or “spoiled.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether Santa Barbara County officials noticed the Spanish mistranslations, the Board of Supervisors approved and accepted the names of Isla Vista’s streets in November 1925.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three months later, attorneys Alfred W. Robertson and James R. Thompson built three long roads adjacent to the bluffs, two of which joined in a loop on the east side of Isla Vista. They named these streets “Embarcadero Del Mar” and “Embarcadero Del Norte,” meaning “Ocean Wharf” and “North Wharf.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attorneys set aside the inside of the loop for an athletic park, and they extended the four parallel roads built by the Ilharreguys. Most of the streets on the east end of I.V. kept their original names, except Pasado Road, which was renamed “Sevilla” and later became Seville Road.</span></p>\n<p>Robertson and Thompson also named the streets that crossed Embarcadero Del Mar and Embarcadero Del Norte: Cervantes Road, El Greco Road, Picasso Road, Segovia Road, Cordoba Road, Madrid Road and Seville Road. The developers named these streets after prominent Spanish artists and cities, but the streets only existed on paper at the time.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harriet and Brenda Moody, the daughters of building contractor Elmer Moody, developed a tract of land from the Ilharreguy property to Coal Oil Point, submitting a map to the county in April 1926.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite much of the planning that took place in the 1920s between these various landowners, much of Isla Vista looked as though it had never been developed by the early 1940s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historian Jennifer Hildreth Strand noted in her 1987</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">master’s thesis at UC Santa Barbara that Isla Vista was covered with bean fields, a place where “goats wandered” and “roosters crowed.”</span></p>\n<p>The streets that are now Abrego Road and Sueno Road appeared unnamed in a 1944 map of Isla Vista, when a U.S. Marine Corps base was located in place of UCSB.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the establishment of the university, developers began consulting many of the plans laid out by the Ilharreguys, Robertson and Thompson and the Moody sisters in the 1920s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county formed an Assessment District in 1960 to pave and construct much of these roads. By 1968, a map of Isla Vista indicated the newly added Camino Majorca, Fortuna Road, Fortuna Lane and Estero Road. Abrego Road and Sueno Road appeared as named streets on this map.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sueno Road seems to have referred to “dream” in Spanish, but the current spelling omits the “ñ” used in Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cerrato said it does not surprise her at all that historic developers named many of Isla Vista’s streets with little knowledge of the Spanish language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a white community, so this is expected,” Cerrato said.</span></p>\n<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, May 5, 2016 print edition of the</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> Daily Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70692\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/street-names-lack-proper-spanish/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70692\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/street-names-lack-proper-spanish/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/street-names-lack-proper-spanish/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/street-names-lack-proper-spanish/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/street-names-lack-proper-spanish/","id":4589,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4588,4587,4586],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Siavash Zohoori Recognized as Student Advocate of the Year","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Attachment-1.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Attachment-1.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The University of California Student Association recognized a UCSB student and May 23 shooting survivor as Student Advocate of the Year on Sunday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The University of California Student Association (UCSA) recognized a UCSB student and May 23, 2014, shooting survivor as Student Advocate of the Year on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Siavash Zohoori, a fourth-year economics and sociology double major, received the award for working toward improvements in sexual assault prevention and mental health services.</p>\n<p>Zohoori led the beginning stages of UCSA’s #HowAreYou campaign in early summer 2015, pushing forward a system-wide effort to reform student mental health services on UC campuses.

His research directed him to create the “Boys ‘n’ Guns” initiative, which aims to address the relationship between mental health, gun violence and societal pressures of masculinity.</p>\n<p>Zohoori also hosted several workshops on sexual assault and mental health at UCSA conferences throughout 2014 and 2015. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/frats-address-sexual-assault-masculinity-issues/\">In October 2015</a>, he spoke to UCSB’s Inter-Fraternity Council about a culture of sexual assault within universities.</p>\n<p>“I started to really learn to use my story to do something that I really love doing, and that’s to help people feel more connected,” Zohoori said.</p>\n<p>“He’s done exceptional things, both with his own program and with helping with a lot of statewide initiatives,” said Mohsin Mirza, Associated Students External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major.</p>\n<p>Prior to the creation of the #HowAreYou campaign, Mirza’s office asked Zohoori to participate in forming a statewide student mental health campaign, first known as <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-08-20/ucsa-to-focus-on-letstalk-mental-health-awareness-campaign/\">#LetsTalk</a>.</p>\n<p>“We were anticipating that it would be a big topic in the year to come, but even then we didn’t expect it to be what it became,” Mirza said. “He played a big part in that.”</p>\n<p>Zohoori released his video “Why Do Mass Shootings Happen?” in February, in which he speaks about his personal experiences during the events of May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe

tough times in our life — we’re all going through shit,” Zohoori says in the video. “We need to show each other more support and compassion, just like we did back in May, because with communities like these we’d never feel the need to prove ourselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

UCSB, which has not been updated since 1995. Graduate students hope it will protect them from “abusing power.” <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) is proposing a revised graduate student Bill of Rights for the first time since 1995 to protect graduate students from abuse and exploitation.</p>\n<p>The GSA passed the newly drafted Bill of Rights in its General Assembly meeting on April 5. Representatives submitted the draft to the Academic Senate on Monday and hope to present before the Senate’s Graduate Council soon.</p>\n<p>The Bill of Rights currently in action at UCSB was drafted and ratified in 1995. The University of California Student Association (UCSA) drafted a system-wide graduate student Bill of Rights in 2011 and UCSB’s GSA informally approved it soon after.</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of Student Affairs Kathy Swift initiated the revised Bill of Rights in December and said she expanded upon UCSA’s 2011 Bill to make the new Bill. The 2011 Bill is about 20 pages long, and the recently passed draft is about 21 pages long.</p>\n<p>“I just basically beefed it up and expanded a couple parts that I thought were needing more support, more explanation,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>Swift said the new bill adds language allowing for the creation of a graduate student advocate position and a shared governance board. Her vision is that the graduate student advocate would be someone students could rely on to “negotiate through the bureaucracy” and resolve disputes.</p>\n<p>The shared governance board, Swift said, would be a group of student representatives, including the graduate student advocate, with voting power in the Academic Senate. Swift said members of the Academic Senate might be skeptical of allowing a shared governance board.</p>\n<p>“That’s a real touchy one,” Swift said. “That’s where we’re going to get into some negotiation.”</p>\n<p>According to Swift, the need for a revised Bill of Rights comes from the “touchy and more sensitive relationship” between graduate students and the university. She said academic departments typically consider graduate students as low‐level associates rather than colleagues.</p>\n<p>“We encounter situations where we’re exploited or we’re taken advantage of or we’re not respected,” Swift said. “That can really be destructive for our academic careers.”</p>\n<p>Timothy Irvine, GSA vice president of committees, helped Swift draft the bill and said advisers have strong influence over a graduate student’s professional life through letters of recommendation, networking and aid in publishing.</p>\n<p>Graduate students are “basically working under a group of like three to six people who have control over all of those things,” Irvine said. “So, if they decide to abuse their power, your ability to respond to that is extremely limited.”</p>\n<p>Irvine said the university currently has a process in place by which graduate students can respond to abuse, but he said these efforts are “akin to Band‐Aids on bullet holes.”</p>\n<p>“There is a method for adjudication, but it doesn’t necessarily work that well, and it doesn’t necessarily give people justice,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Yanira Rivas Pineda, the GSA external vice president, said having a graduate student Bill of Rights is necessary to help graduate students who are in dysfunctional relationships with their advisors.</p>\n<p>“As graduate students, we sacrifice our financial stability and basically put our life on hold for a few years,” Pineda said in an email. “The last thing we need is to have to navigate conflicts on our own with little to no support or guidance.”</p>\n<p>Swift said the 1995 Bill of Rights in action across the university, drafted in 1995, offers basic protections to graduate students, but is incomplete.</p>\n<p>“It is not comprehensive,” Swift said. “It doesn’t cover a lot of areas that graduate students need.”</p>\n<p>Swift said she needs to consult with the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division, otherwise the newly revised graduate student Bill of Rights will not be enforced.</p>\n<p>“[Graduate students] don’t have that much in the way of enforcement power at all, which is why it’s necessary for us to try to negotiate this with the Graduate Division and the Academic Senate,” Swift said. “They’re the ones that will make the enforcement.”</p>\n<p>Swift said representatives of the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division have already begun to express skepticism toward the new draft in her meetings with them.</p>\n<p>“This is going to cause problems,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 14, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Womyn’s Commission</p></div>\n<p>According to the conference mission statement, the event recognizes that womxn of color are members of marginalized communities whose shared experiences come to shape their identity in society. The purpose of the conference, then, is to create a means of supporting ethnic minority womxn — to “exist unapologetically.”</p>\n<p>“We work towards empowerment for ourselves in a world that tries to shame or erase our existence,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>Organizers have laid out several questions they hope to discuss throughout the weekend, such as “How do we navigate and come to comprehend our trauma in relation to our very existence?” and “Why is it important to center our movements on love and re-incorporate joy into every aspect of our lives in order to counteract this dominant narrative of struggle?”</p>\n<p>“We hope to generate answers to these questions through a combination of individual reflection and the sharing of collective knowledge,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>Karen Hanna, graduate student in feminist studies and event volunteer, said she and Lola Mondragon, graduate student in Chican@ studies, will be hosting a workshop titled “Sacred Bodies, Safe Spaces: Healing in Community Through Drumming, Meditation, and Coloring.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a place that we can build and say it’s for us, and we don’t have to feel guilty about that,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>As an Asian American womxn, Hanna said she often feels devalued by stereotypes that define Asian womxn as quiet and submissive. Hanna said the conference offers a place of healing for womxn of color who are often subject to stereotypes.</p>\n<p>Michaela Austin, first-year environmental studies major and feminist studies minor, said WOCC acts as an opportunity for ethnic minority womxn to discuss issues that society does not otherwise address.</p>\n<p>“Living in a racialized patriarchal society, womxn, and especially womxn of color — our needs aren’t met. We’re not talked about in issues,” Austin said. “Having a space where we can talk will build solidarity and space.”</p>\n<p>According to Mondragon, the conference is a “sacred” space for womxn of color to support one another.</p>\n<p>“It’s not only sacred but it’s a safe space where we have a shared experience in multiple ways as we can come together to help lift each other up, lean on each other and see each other,” Mondragon said. “We aren’t usually seen by others in a world where we’re often invisible.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>*<em>This article has been updated from its original form to reflect an omitted quote that was not necessary to the story.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/wocc-to-discuss-gender-issues-empowerment/","id":2624,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2623,2622,2621],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"District Supervisor Candidates Share Platforms","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Bruce-Porter-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Bruce-Porter-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor candidates spoke with the Nexus this week to share their platforms for Isla Vista and the county.

He currently works as president of the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District School Board, chairman of the Santa Ynez Valley Youth Coalition and Edward Jones financial advisor.</p>\n<p>Porter announced in late January his plan to initiate an Economic Prosperity Corridor should he be elected as supervisor. According to Porter, most of the tech firms in Santa Barbara County are located in Goleta, which he said forces workers to commute on the 101 from their homes in the rest of the county.</p>\n<p>“As I’ve met with officials at UCSB, I’ve learned of a wave of new companies and new technologies that will be spinning out of research at UCSB, and in the past a lot of those just went into Goleta,” Porter said. “Goleta is pretty well built-out now.”</p>\n<p>His plan with the Economic Prosperity Corridor is to encourage businesses to “set up shop” in areas like Buellton, Lompoc and Santa Maria to reduce the number of freeway commuters. According to Porter, this initiative will help to reduce pollution, preserve infrastructure and allow UCSB grads to stay in the Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Let’s move those new businesses out into other parts of the county where they’ll be closer to the people who actually work there,” Porter said. “That would be keeping all these great businesses in the county.”</p>\n<p>As for the county’s involvement in I.V., Porter said he hopes to be a leader and a “champion” for getting the Community Services District (CSD) proposal passed in November. He said the ultimate goal for I.V. is cityhood.</p>\n<p>“In the long range, the goal is cityhood for Isla Vista, if that’s what the residents want. The CSD is sort of a tiny little step to that eventual goal,” Porter said. “[I want to help] shape the whole process over time so that we continue the path to full cityhood.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68106\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68106\" data-attachment-id=\"68106\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/supervisor-joan-hartmann-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=1375%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1375,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Supervisor Joan Hartmann\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?fit=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68106 \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1-704x1024.jpg?resize=296%2C431\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Joanhartmannforsupervisor.org\" width=\"296\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Joan-Hartmann-1.jpg?w=1375&amp;ssl=1 1375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Joanhartmannforsupervisor.org</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Planning Commissioner Joan Hartmann declared candidacy in early January in hopes to “continue and build on” the role of her soon-to-retire employer, Farr.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s career began in academia when she earned a Ph.D. in Government from Claremont Graduate School, where she was appointed as the first female faculty member and director of the Public Policy Program. She also served on the faculty at Oberlin College and later served as adjunct professor at USC. She currently serves on the Santa Barbara Foundation’s LEAF Advisory Committee and the Wilding Museum’s Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>According to Hartmann, the platform of her bid for supervisor is “enhancing the quality of life that we cherish in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p>“I think Doreen Farr has done a really good job connecting people to county resources, and her staff has worked hard to provide good, strong constituency services,” Hartmann said. “I would like to build on that.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said one of the issues she hopes to address is economic vitality in the county. She said she hopes to increase cooperation between the private and public sectors, following the models laid out by Ventura County, San Luis Obispo County and Sonoma County.</p>\n<p>“The question is, ‘What do we want in Santa Barbara County?’” Hartmann said. “I would like the county to help bring the various entities together and hear that out in a more deliberate way.”</p>\n<p>As for the county’s involvement in I.V. and the University, Hartmann said she wants to take on a similar role as Farr in regularly meeting with residents and university officials.</p>\n<p>“I think Doreen and her staff have worked very hard to participate in the various working groups and committees in Isla Vista, and I would certainly continue that,” Hartmann said. “I know she also meets regularly with UCSB representatives and tries to find ways that they can work together on issues. I would want to continue that and build on it.”</p>\n<p>Should I.V. residents approve a CSD in November, Hartmann said she would be supportive but yielding to the needs of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“If there is a CSD, I think that is something I would support,” Hartmann said. “As a supervisor, I think it’s really something that is controlled largely by the community. I think that’s the whole point.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68105\" style=\"width: 323px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68105\" data-attachment-id=\"68105\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/district-supervisor-candidates-share-platforms/supervisor-jay-freeman-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=1375%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1375,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Supervisor Jay Freeman-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?fit=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68105 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1-704x1024.jpg?resize=313%2C456\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Cult of Mac\" width=\"313\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=704%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Supervisor-Jay-Freeman-1.jpg?w=1375&amp;ssl=1 1375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Cult of Mac</p></div>\n<p>Sixteen-year I.V. resident Jay Freeman declared candidacy late January in order to fill a role where he said he seems to be needed.</p>\n<p>Freeman grew up in Chicago and came to UCSB in 1999 to study computer science. He is the founder of the multimillion-dollar software company Cydia, an app that allows users to customize jailbroken Apple devices. Freeman currently serves as vice president of the Isla Vista Downtown Business Association and is an active member of the Isla Vista Self-Governance Initiative.</p>\n<p>As for Freeman’s involvement in the supervisor race, Freeman said he has “kind of fallen into this” — he believes the county’s board of supervisors is a place that has shown a need for him.</p>\n<p>“I’m not a career politician in the sense that I want to rise through the ranks,” Freeman said. “I want essentially to be the man in the field who’s actually trying to figure out how to make practical solutions to real world problems, as opposed to sitting back and doing legislation.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, the county needs to be more proactive in serving its residents.<br>\n“The county just allows problems to occur, then waits for people to complain about them and then tries to quell the uprising,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said one of the issues he hopes to address as supervisor is the lack of interaction between I.V. residents and county officials. According to Freeman, it is inadequate that state assemblymember Das Williams has had to host meetings to foster communication between I.V. and the county.</p>\n<p>“It’s slightly awkward that we’ve had to have our state assemblymember run meetings that are almost mediating between the people of Isla Vista and the county,” Freeman said. “That’s the kind of meeting that I would have expected that the county would have been setting up.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he wants to be a county supervisor that is actively involved in local meetings in the county’s unincorporated areas.</p>\n<p>“I actually want to try to sit down in various local meetings and try to come up with compromises between bringing people together,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, I.V. cannot attain the full benefits of a CSD unless the county “steps up” and institutes a Municipal Advisory Council or an Area Planning Commission.</p>\n<p>“With a Community Services District, one of the powers that it can have is to fund a Municipal Advisory Council, but it doesn’t have the power to make a Municipal Advisory Council,” Freeman said. “The county has to support that.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Businesses are worried that they will be negatively impacted by power outages due to their forced closures. <em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista business owners and managers shared their experiences with the Nexus this week regarding the recent power outages amidst stormy weather in the Goleta area.</p>\n<p>Many local businesses have reported losing all electricity with the onset of El Niño storms. On Jan. 5, for example, strong winds damaged infrastructure and caused a power outage throughout I.V.’s downtown business district that lasted several hours, and smaller power outages have followed. In such circumstances, many businesses report having to close stores until power is restored.</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Co-op general manager Melissa Cohen said the co-op lost at least half of its sales on Jan. 5 as the result of a power outage that rendered the store closed for five hours. According to Cohen, the store averages about $10,000 a day in sales, but it only made about $5,000 on Jan. 5.</p>\n<p>“It’s very hard to have to sit at the entrance of your business and say, ‘Sorry there’s no power,’” Cohen said. “That was stressful and our sales that day really suffered.”</p>\n<p>Otaco manager and third-year sociology student Richard Kim said the restaurant loses money during power outages, especially when the blackouts occur at night.</p>\n<p>“It does affect our numbers because we sell beer and beer sells better at night,” Kim said. “It hurts financially.”</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Drip owner Tom Leu, however, the power outage saved his restaurant money because business was already slow during recent storms and the loss of power allowed him to send employees home.</p>\n<p>“That was a perfect time for a power outage,” Leu said.</p>\n<p>Aladdin Café employee Steven Abdulhai, whose family owns the restaurant, said his family will usually check in with their neighboring restaurant Woodstock’s Pizza to determine whether or not to close during power outages.</p>\n<p>“We like to keep ourselves updated with Woodstock’s — we’re cool with the employees there,” Abdulhai said. “If it’s not too serious for them to be closing, then we’ll probably stay open.”</p>\n<p>Buddha Bowls owner Daniel Dunietz said the “real issue” with power outages is maintaining food temperatures. According to Dunietz, the loss of power shuts down refrigeration, which can cause food to spoil over a certain period of time.</p>\n<p>“There is a fair amount of built-in insulation, but we still watch those temperatures slowly rise,” Dunietz said. “Once it gets past a certain point, [the food] becomes dangerous, and if it stays at that point for some time, you have to throw out everything.”</p>\n<p>Dunietz said he instructs his employees to keep the coolers closed to preserve the cool air inside in case of outages.</p>\n<p>“We have a protocol where you just don’t open the cooler, because it is insulated so it can keep that temperature cool for almost six to eight hours,” Dunietz said.</p>\n<p>Dunietz said Southern California Edison has usually had a quick response time to damaged infrastructure during storms.</p>\n<p>“The guys at Edison have been really awesome, so I’ve been giving them coupons and stuff,” Dunietz said. “They bust their ass.”</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, power outages have some positive results.</p>\n<p>“The beauty of those power outage days is that celebration when the power goes back on,” Cohen said. “We can invite our people back into our store.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Santa Barbara this quarter.</p>\n<p>The graduate seminar meets in a small classroom in the Humanities and Social Sciences Building and is intended for a maximum of 25 students. Yet, even as the university heads into its third week of the Winter Quarter, there are not enough chairs in the room for all of the fascinated students.</p>\n<p>While Analytic Number Theory may not be what attracts these students, the professor, Dr. Yitang Zhang, does.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably, at this point, one of the most famous mathematicians in the world,” Jeffrey Stopple, UCSB mathematics professor, told the Nexus when Zhang was hired in September. “I think there might be only maybe two or three others alive that have his level of celebrity.”</p>\n<p>Zhang gained fame amongst mathematicians in 2013 after submitting a proof to the Annals of Mathematics, establishing the first finite bound on gaps between twin prime numbers and thus solving the Twin Prime Conjecture, a 150-year-old math problem. At the time, he was working as a part-time calculus teacher at the University of New Hampshire and gained instant recognition, winning a MacArthur Award in 2014, and was promoted to full professorship.</p>\n<p>Zhang’s accomplishment also made its way to the silver screen. The New York Times reported Zhang’s breakthrough a month after his submission, and filmmaker George Csicsery made Zhang the subject of 2015 documentary “Counting from Infinity.”</p>\n<p>Garo Sarajian, a mathematics graduate student at UCSB, said he noticed that people outside of the math world were beginning to recognize Zhang’s name.</p>\n<p>Sarajian said he struck up a conversation with a “random economics student” next to him on the bus, and was surprised that he had already heard of Zhang.</p>\n<p>“Of course I know [Zhang] is a big deal, but I had no idea how big of a deal he was outside the department,” Sarajian said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s math department announced Zhang’s hiring in September. Zhang currently spends much of his time teaching one very popular, overcrowded graduate seminar and conducting further research into number theory.</p>\n<p>“The department did not ask me to teach so much, but I will at times,” Zhang said. “It’s more research time.”</p>\n<p>Zhang said he decided to accept an offer from Chancellor Henry T. Yang in the summer after he was recommended by Harvard University mathematics professor Shing-Tung Yau.</p>\n<p>“I got an email from Professor Yau and, very quickly, I said, ‘Yes I would like to do that,’” Zhang said.</p>\n<p>Zhang remarks that the “feeling” and environment in Santa Barbara is “very different” from New Hampshire. He said he especially enjoys the view of the Santa Ynez Mountains from his office on the sixth floor of South Hall.</p>\n<p>“On a sunny day, you can see the mountain very clearly,” Zhang said. “I really love it here. I will use the good environment to try to do something more.”</p>\n<p>When he is not teaching or researching, Zhang walks around campus and on the beach. Sarajian said Zhang will strike up small conversations with many of the people he passes.</p>\n<p>“He’s very friendly and very approachable,” Sarajian said. “If you didn’t know who he is, you’d think he’s just another very friendly professor.”</p>\n<p>Sarajian, who attends Zhang’s Analytic Number Theory seminar, said Zhang possesses a remarkable ability to engage with his students, whether it be frequently joking with the class or providing insight.</p>\n<p>“He’s not only good at teaching but also at getting [students] excited about what he’s teaching as well,” Sarajian said. “When someone in his position is able to do that, it’s a big deal.”</p>\n<p>Mathematics graduate student Nicolas Brody said Zhang is energetic but modest.</p>\n<p>“However great his achievements, he is a remarkably humble man, and in his Analytic Number Theory course this quarter, he is a very expressive and energetic professor,” Brody said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang said having an “exceptionally dedicated” teacher and mathematician like Zhang on campus boosts the university’s status.</p>\n<p>“His renowned research and scholarship elevate the proud reputation of our university, and now that he is here in the classroom, our students and their education will directly benefit from his brilliance,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Sarajian said he thinks Zhang’s presence will add prestige to the university and attract more students to the program.</p>\n<p>“The school has a celebrity professor we can brag about,” Sarajian said. “It’s amazing how one person does make a difference.”</p>\n<p>Zhang said he hopes to stay at UCSB until his eventual retirement.</p>\n<p>Despite all of his achievements, Zhang said he does not believe he has yet reached the pinnacle of his career.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to keep going up,” Zhang said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

Wells Fargo this week to divest from private prisons.</p>\n<p>Students from the Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC), an alliance of black student groups on nine UC campuses, released a statement Monday demanding Wells Fargo sell its shares in private prisons and end all business relations with the companies by Feb. 20. According to the statement, if Wells Fargo fails to do so by the deadline, ABC will continue to pressure the UC to divest its $425 million invested with Wells Fargo. ABC pressured UC to divest from private prisons in December, prompting UC to sell approximately $25 million in private prison shares.</p>\n<p>Nia Mitchell, UCSB Black Student Union Political Chair and fourth-year environmental studies major, said black students remain upset that the UC invests in Wells Fargo despite selling its shares in private prison corporations. Mitchell said she believes Wells Fargo contributes to private prison funding.</p>\n<p>“We cannot be complacent with the fact that our tuition is being invested, either indirectly or directly, to the incarceration of our people,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>ABC spokesperson Anthony Williams, citing research conducted by Enlace’s Private Prison Divestment Campaign, said Wells Fargo is financially invested in private prison corporations such as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and The GEO Group (GEO) in several ways.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, Wells Fargo owns 1.5 million shares in GEO and CCA, acts as an issuing lender on CCA’s $900 million line of credit and serves as bond trustee to GEO’s $300 million corporate debt.</p>\n<p>“They are funding private prisons,” Williams said. “Wells Fargo is completely complicit in private prisons and what they do and how they treat people, which is horrid.”</p>\n<p>According to Wells Fargo spokesperson Ruben Pulido, the bank bears no financial investment in either GEO or CCA. Pulido said Wells Fargo Funds, owned by the funds’ investors and not Wells Fargo, currently holds a small position in the companies through a passive index fund.</p>\n<p>“Wells Fargo holds no investment in either The GEO Group or the Corrections Corporation of America,” Pulido said in an email. “We have no seat on either company’s board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Henning Bohn said Wells Fargo provides passive index funds for customers to invest in other companies, which is a product that “any random financial firm” would offer to its customers. Bohn said Wells Fargo customers own the shares in private prison corporations, not Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p>“From an economic perspective, I would say [Wells Fargo] doesn’t really hold an economic interest because the interest is held by their customers — those are the beneficiaries,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Bohn said if Wells Fargo were to end all investments in private prison corporations through index funds, the bank would first have to withdraw all index fund products, and would only offer funds investing in companies in which the bank wants clients to invest.</p>\n<p>“That’s something that Wells Fargo is probably not going to do,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said she does not believe the distinction between Well Fargo and Wells Fargo Funds makes a difference.</p>\n<p>“It’s still Wells Fargo,” Mitchell said. “You can separate it however you want bureaucratically, but it is the arm of the same system.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitchell, black student leaders want UC and other “financiers” to divest from for-profit prisons because of how incarceration oppresses black people.</p>\n<p>“Private prisons literally make a profit off of the incarceration of people, who, within a system that’s rooted in white supremacy and capitalism, are for the most part black and brown bodies,” Mitchell said. “Their system of mass incarceration has not helped the black community.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the business model of private prisons requires they lobby for criminal justice and immigration policies to incarcerate as many people as possible. Williams also said these policies generally lead to the disproportionate number of racial minorities in the prison facilities of corporations like GEO and CCA.</p>\n<p>“Their business model is getting as many people incarcerated as possible and having contracts, and if they can’t do that, then how are they going to make money?” Williams said.</p>\n<p>According to CCA Director of Public Affairs Jonathan Burns, CCA does not take an active stance on public policies affecting incarceration.</p>\n<p>“To be clear, CCA does not draft, lobby for or in any way promote policies that determine the basis for or duration of an individual’s incarceration or detention,” Burns said in an email.</p>\n<p>GEO Vice President of Corporate Relations Pablo Paez also said he “vehemently refutes” these charges.</p>\n<p>“The allegation that our company has engaged in lobbying and advocacy for public policies that are detrimental to communities is simply not accurate,” Paez said. “Our company has never taken a position on criminal justice or immigration policies.”</p>\n<p>Paez said GEO helps those who are incarcerated by investing millions of dollars into rehabilitation and re-entry programs for prisoners to transition more smoothly back into society.</p>\n<p>“Groups like this one advance the notion that groups in our industry are somehow unaccountable to the government and to the public,” Paez said. “What we’ve done over the years is counter the rhetoric that is being advanced by groups like that of the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Williams said there is nothing a private prison corporation like GEO can do to be accountable to the public except to close its doors.</p>\n<p>“For private prison organizations to be accountable to the public, they would have to shut down,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The RAND report indicates the percentage of students accessing mental health treatment increased by about 13 percent from 2013 to 2014. UCSB’s Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) confirms an increase in the number of students it has been treating since receiving CalMHSA funding in 2011.</p>\n<p>RAND Corporation associate policy researcher and lead author of the study J. Scott Ashwood said the increase indicates more students are going to counseling services to receive necessary help.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students at UCs and other systems experience mental health disorders, and it’s also the case that most of those students don’t receive services or treatment for those mental health disorders,” Ashwood said. “We think an increase of 13 percent is a really positive increase because it means that more students are getting treatment for these conditions that they weren’t getting treatment for before.”</p>\n<p>Ashwood said there could be more than one reason campuses treated more students between 2013 and 2014 than in previous years, such as an increase in the amount of insured students due to the Affordable Care Act, but he believes CalMHSA funding for campus mental health services is the primary reason for the increase.</p>\n<p>“We’re pretty confident that some of this increase, at least — and possibly all of it — is due to CalMHSA’s investment,” Ashwood said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. director Jeanne Stanford said UCSB’s mental health services center has seen a 20 percent increase in the amount of students it serves every year since it first received CalMHSA grant funding in 2011.</p>\n<p>“I never knew what money would do for mental health services until we got the grant,” Stanford said. “It made us visible and it made mental health visible. None of that, or maybe a quarter of that, would have been done without the CalMHSA funds.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. mental health specialist Gladys Koscak, who helped decide how to spend CalMHSA grant funding, said C.A.P.S. used the state money mostly for outreach, such as the center’s #SaySomething campaign, which launched in 2012.</p>\n<p>“[The grant] gave us the opportunity to have money for outreach and marketing materials that we typically don’t have money to be able to purchase,” Koscak said. “That really helped spread the word both about our services and also about mental health in general.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. psychologist Janet Osimo, who also helped allocate CalMHSA grant funds, said the additional money allowed C.A.P.S. to develop a mobile phone app and an online interactive screening program alongside its #SaySomething campaign, which she said encouraged students to access C.A.P.S. over the past few years.</p>\n<p>“I think what the extra funding does for us is it really helps address the unspoken need out there that we’re not aware of so we can start opening our doors more,” Osimo said. “Fortunately, we’ve been able to continue that.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said she hopes the increase in the number of students that C.A.P.S. has treated since 2011 leads university policy makers to give even more funding for campus mental health services.</p>\n<p>“I hope it increases the allotment and that it increases what the universities are willing to give to student mental health,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Stanford also said she hopes to see administration designate more campus space to C.A.P.S. to meet the university’s increasing demand for mental health treatment.</p>\n<p>“You can’t just increase the numbers in the schools or build more residence halls without thinking about mental health,” Stanford said. “It’s about finding the space for mental health and wellness services on a campus and making it a policy that every campus has to increase their ability to provide services.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and sociology double major Siavash Zohoori said the RAND Corporation findings will demonstrate to the UC Board of Regents that increased funding toward campus mental health services allows universities to treat more students.</p>\n<p>“I think that the study was a necessary step that a lot of activists were waiting for so that we could prove to the Regents and the policy makers that the funding is really necessary and will be effective,” Zohoori said. “Increased funding will actually benefit students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In the meeting, students, long-term residents and representatives from the Santa Barbara County considered the possibility of creating an I.V. Code Enforcement Program allowing the CSD to enforce building and zoning codes in I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Deputy Director of Planning and Development Glenn Russell, the cost to expand the County’s current Code Enforcement Program would be approximately $235,000 a year, and it would cost an I.V. CSD about $20,000 to $25,000 to get the program started.</p>\n<p>“$235,000 is a reasonable estimate,” Russell said. “It could be a little bit more. It could be a little bit less.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee Jonathan Abboud said Russell’s estimate for the Code Enforcement Program is significantly larger than the $120,000 estimated in the Financial Analysis Study The Fund for Santa Barbara released in September 2015.</p>\n<p>“That sounds like a lot of money,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Russell, the current Code Enforcement Program only investigates building and zoning code violations if residents report them to the county.</p>\n<p>“What we have today is a reactive code enforcement program, both for building and zoning violations,” Russell said. “Anybody in Isla Vista who reports a building or zoning violation can have it investigated.”</p>\n<p>Russell said a “proactive” Code Enforcement Program — one where Program officials can exercise their police powers to bring residences up to code — would raise the possibility of evicting residents for zoning violations, which is the protocol for enforcing such codes.</p>\n<p>“Be careful what you wish for,” Russell said. “You have to be very judicious in how you apply these limited police powers. A proactive Code Enforcement Program would put people out of their lodging.”</p>\n<p>According to Field Representative for Assemblymember Das Williams’ office Cameron Schunk, the structure of an I.V. CSD’s Code Enforcement Program will largely depend upon the funding it receives from UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be largely contingent on what we hear from UCSB as far as what they want to contribute towards what type of program they want to see,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Schunk also said University administrators discussed the possibility of opening University housing to students the CSD’s Code Enforcement Program temporarily evicts as incentive to bring their residencies up to code.</p>\n<p>“There were talks amongst administrative officials about offering some of the University’s housing as kind of temporary assistance housing if we decided to pursue some sort of code enforcement to bring the housing stock of I.V. back up to an acceptable level,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>With this option, however, Schunk said there is a “hidden catch” that the evicted students’ landlord might decrease the number of bedrooms in the residence.</p>\n<p>“There’s no guarantee that you’re going to have a place to go back to,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>As a solution for assisting evicted residents, Abboud said he suggests the I.V. CSD create a temporary housing fund.</p>\n<p>“If the I.V. CSD did implement this, we could have a small fund to help people who got kicked out to find temporary relocation for a month until they could move back into their place once it’s up to code,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said she is concerned about the possibility of evicting I.V. residents for violating zoning codes, such as by living in a closet or a garage.</p>\n<p>“These sort of people are not living in those conditions because they want to. It is because they have no other resources,” Dela Cruz said. “I think it’s important for us to keep that in mind that there are larger reasons for why these issues are occurring in our community, and we need to think about that as well while we’re thinking about this program.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66897\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"128780311\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66919\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66897\" data-attachment-id=\"66897\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/stakeholders-discuss-code-enforcement-program/iv-stakeholders-121-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"IV Stakeholders discussing the current county coe enforcement, and what would happen if we were switched to proactive enforcement.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1448996545\",\"copyright\":\"John Clow\\/DN\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"IV Stakeholders 12\\/1\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Stakeholders 12/1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66897\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"John Clow/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66897\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to Russell, however, a Code Enforcement Program cannot ignore violations for the sake of avoiding the eviction of residents, as it must be consistent in enforcing violations.</p>\n<p>“You can’t ignore something someplace because you just feel bad,” Russell said. “You have to be absolutely consistent and even-handed.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said she hopes the CSD’s Code Enforcement Program will provide opportunities for students to get involved.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested in hearing about the students and the involvement we may have in this Code Enforcement Program,” Dela Cruz said. “This is something that I think the university is very interested in.

Veterans can apply for a new driver’s license or ID card by bringing their DD-214 to a County Veterans Service Office and making an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The DMV requires veterans to pay a $5 application fee.</p>\n<p>According to California State Assemblymember Jim Frazier, who authored AB 935, the bill allows Californians to fulfill their “responsibility” of ensuring veterans are “well-equipped” for civilian life.</p>\n<p>“Assembly Bill 935 helps us fulfill that pledge to our veterans,” Frazier said in a statement. “Proof of military service is now literally at the individual’s fingertips, which will help ensure that California veterans are receiving all the benefits they’re rightfully entitled to.”</p>\n<p>U.S. Army veteran and engineering graduate student Paul Malone said this legislation frees veterans from needing to have DD-214 certificates on hand in order to enjoy benefits, which he said is a “dumb thing,” because the discharge certificate is a sensitive document, comparable to a birth certificate or Social Security card.</p>\n<p>“Most people carry their licenses with them, which makes this a common sense fix to a problem within our community, assuming it is honored as valid proof,” Malone said in an email.</p>\n<p>Malone said he worries that California lawmakers will “hang their hat” on veterans’ laws now that AB 935’s has passed.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot more to be done just to catch up to other states in terms of what they’re doing for veterans,” Malone said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB Veteran Resource Center counselor and religious studies graduate student Sam Reid said the new veteran license and ID is ultimately “not that big of a deal” for veterans like himself who already carry a United States Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) identification card.</p>\n<p>“If I already have the card, I don’t really need the indicator,” Reid said. “It’s a cool thing, but it’s not some revolutionary game-changer.”</p>\n<p>Reid said he will add the designation to his driver’s license the next time he renews his license at the DMV.</p>\n<p>“I will do that when I renew my license, but I won’t go out of my way,” Reid said.</p>\n<p>U.S. Navy veteran and Chican@ studies Ph.D. candidate Delores Mondragón said AB 935 will especially help female veterans.</p>\n<p>According to Mondragón, she and her husband once tried to get a free coffee at Starbucks on Veterans Day as part of a promotion, and an employee asked Mondragón for pictures of her in uniform, but did not ask her husband for the same.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s an important thing to have, especially for female veterans,” Mondragón said. “I think we have a much harder time being legitimized as veterans.”</p>\n<p>Mondragón also said female veterans are less likely carry alternate forms of identification offered by veteran organizations such as the V.A., the Veterans of Foreign Wars or the American Legion, as they often avoid these organizations because they are “saturated with men.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of women veterans don’t like to be around that many men anymore, especially if we’re the only ones amidst a thousand men,” Mondragón said.</p>\n<p>Mondragón said her biggest concern is that the DMV is charging veterans to apply to add the designation, which she said seems like a “profiteering” scheme.</p>\n<p>“They’re going to make a profit off of what we thought was inherently a necessity in our community,” Mondragón said. “You’re going to have all these veterans pay to let people know that they’re veterans. That’s the part that I just am in complete disagreement with — I think it should be free.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66515\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66515\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/","id":3864,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3863,3862,3861],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bruce Porter to Run to  Succeed Supervisor Farr","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3487.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3487.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Fifteen-year Santa Ynez resident Bruce Porter announced Monday he will run to succeed Doreen Farr as Third District County Supervisor.

Porter declared his candidacy Monday due to encouragement from neighbors and community leaders according to a press release from his office. Porter is president of the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District School Board, Chairman of the Santa Ynez Valley Youth Coalition, a U.S. Army veteran and an Edward Jones financial advisor.</p>\n<p>According to Porter, 25 years in the Army and 15 years living in Santa Barbara County equip him with the necessary “tools” to improve the county.<br>\n“Why am I doing this? I think the biggest reason is I think I can make a difference,” Porter said.</p>\n<p>Porter said his role as an engineer for the Army required him to make judgments grounded in facts and reason rather than alignment with a belief system. According to Porter, this is the type of decision making that needs to take place in the Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p>“In the Army I was apolitical, which taught me how to think not based on ideology, but how to think on what are the facts and figures and how do you make reasoned common sense decisions about how to move forward,” Porter said. “I think that’s exactly the kind of approach we need to take in our county as opposed to just making a decision based on ideology.”<br>\nPorter said his campaign will consist of two parts: hearing potential constituents’ concerns and proposing solutions.</p>\n<p>“Listening to people is going to be the first step. Number two is analyzing what I hear from people and really laying out a new direction for the different communities of the county and laying out how the county can help,” Porter said. “I’m making that a big, big, big part of my campaign.”</p>\n<p>Porter said he walked around Isla Vista on Halloween with Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown and talked with residents about their concerns. According to Porter, the County has been neglecting I.V.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that Isla Vista hasn’t received the appropriate amount of attention from the county,” Porter said. “I think a lot of the unfortunate events over the past year have been a culmination of that benign neglect, if you will. At least that was the sense I was getting, especially from the students, when talking to them on Halloween night.”</p>\n<p>Porter said he plans on meeting with I.V. residents, business owners, students and campus groups to become more familiar with issues concerning I.V. and UC Santa Barbara during his campaign.</p>\n<p>“Clearly, a challenge for me is going to be UCSB and Isla Vista and understanding their issues, because they are so different from where I live in Santa Ynez,” Porter said. “I want to come down and be able to talk to the community leaders there.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the Third District has many types of constituent concerns and has more miles of California coastline than any other supervisorial district in the state. The District includes UCSB, the Los Padres National Forest, the Vandenberg Air Force Base and the Santa Ynez Valley Chumash population, with about 50 percent of its population residing outside city limits.</p>\n<p>Farr said these factors make Third District County Supervisor “more than a full-time job.”</p>\n<p>“We have a very large load of constituent issues that we’re working on throughout the district at any given point in time,” Farr said. “That probably makes the job of the Third District County Supervisor much more palpable and busy than probably any other district in our county.”</p>\n<p>Farr said the role of the Third District County Supervisor is especially important to I.V. residents because I.V. is an unincorporated area that cannot go to a city council and must rely strongly on its county representatives.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot going on and there’s a lot to learn and lot of decisions that the Board of Supervisors will impact on Isla Vista on a day-to-day and year-to-year basis,” Farr said. “The people in the community are going to require, or even demand, that their representative on the Board represent the interest there and advocate for them, as I have done.”</p>\n<p>Farr said Porter’s qualification for the office will become more apparent during the race.</p>\n<p>“It’s just the very beginning of the campaign, and as we move forward we’ll see how he responds to issues in the district and … where he is on various issues that are important to the Isla Vista community in particular,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, I.V. residents are going to want a candidate who supports Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the framework for the creation of a unique Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. funded by a Utilities User Tax (UUT).</p>\n<p>“I think that Isla Vista is going to be looking for a strong advocate of what the community wants, including AB 3,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said she hopes to learn candidates’ stances on issues such as AB 3, parking in I.V., the environment and I.V.’s Latino population.</p>\n<p>“I’d also like to learn more about their views on other social justice issues — things that I have taken very seriously in my role as EVPLA,” Dela Cruz said. “They are going to have a huge role in this because they are the voice of our community and they’re defending us at the county level.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she wants the future County Supervisor to have the same involvement with I.V. residents and UCSB students that Farr has had throughout her seven years in the office.</p>\n<p>“I would personally like to see this individual have the personal connection that Doreen Farr has had with us thus far in issues like AB 3 and other ongoing projects,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Downtown Business Association vice president Jay Freeman, Porter might struggle to win votes from I.V. residents due to his military background despite being a strong candidate.</p>\n<p>“Bruce Porter is clearly a very strong and experienced candidate, but I think he will have an uphill battle here in Isla Vista,” Freeman said. “His ex-military background is impressive, but may turn off student voters.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he advises students to follow the race closely because the support of the Board of Supervisors is crucial for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The large number of highly motivated student voters in Isla Vista should pay close attention to this election, particularly as we will likely see new entrants soon in this race,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This Halloween weekend, there will be approximately 200 officers from both the UC Police Department and Santa Barbara Sherriff’s Department stationed in I.V. Student organizations such as Take Back the Night (TBTM), the Associated Students (A.S.) Commission on Public Safety and the A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) office have planned multiple events this weekend to give students options to safely celebrate Halloween.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said A.S. will host Pardall Center Chill Space from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday on the first floor of the Pardall Center, open to anyone in I.V. over Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“My main goal is only to provide local, safe and educational events during Halloween,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>TBTN Co-Chair and third-year political science major Gema Hernández Nava said TBTN will host an additional student event from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday on the second floor of the Pardall Center, called Pardall Center Safe Space. Hernández Nava said advocates from Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.) and the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center will be on site to assist students who experience harassment during the Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“We know it can get a little hectic when people get more drunk and when it gets later,” Hernández Nava said. “It’s called a safe space so that people can come and chill if they need a place. They can talk to an advocate if they’ve experienced something dramatic or because they didn’t know what to do in a situation.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said her office will also be hosting Haunt the Loop from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday in the I.V. business area, a trick-or-treat event for Isla Vista residents to go visit I.V. businesses and receive gifts and candy.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to shift culture and get families to come and actually trick-or-treat here,” Dela Cruz said. “They can actually enjoy Halloween. It’s not just drunk students partying.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Commission on Public Safety Chair and second-year political science and global studies double-major Dwayne Mosbey said student organizations are working alongside police officers to implement the University of California Isla Vista Volunteering Program (UCIV) — a public volunteer program that mediates between police officers and I.V. partygoers. According to Mosbey, UCIV volunteers will be distributing water, escorting residents to their homes and warning residents of the noise ordinance, which restricts residents from playing loud music past 6 p.m., to prevent citations.</p>\n<p>“[UCIV] is something very simple that we at UCSB can do just to ensure that people in our community, as well as the people coming in, are safe,” Mosbey said. “Even though, in a way, it is a little bit of a reactive measure, it drastically reduces the incidents that are going to be happening that night.”</p>\n<p>According to Mosbey, volunteers and partygoers alike have praised UCIV in the past, and it will likely be a permanent facet for future Halloween and Deltopia weekends.</p>\n<p>“So far, students have loved it. [Volunteers] have a chance to interact with the community and they get volunteer hours for doing something they would have loved to do anyways,” Mosbey said. “It’s looking like it will be a permanent thing for UCSB to have.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said the Isla Vista party scene is largely “uni-dimensional” and does not provide enough options for the university’s diverse and “sophisticated” student population. Fleming said student organizations are hosting alternative events to accommodate the wide interests of UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“Every student doesn’t just want to walk up and down the street or party. Some of our students would really like to have music, entertainment and other things to do,” Fleming said. “I think this is really about giving students options so that there isn’t just this one-size-fits-all attitude or campus environment.”<br>\nFleming said she hopes student organizations will begin hosting alternative events to I.V.’s party scene every weekend, rather than just during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see us have a vibrant weekend music scene that would be happening on campus that would give students an alternative to underage drinking in I.V. or the kind of party scene that can be riskier,” Fleming said. “I actually think that what I’m seeing is that students want that, and I’m hoping we can have a partnership around that.”</p>\n<p>A version of

following Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 in the interest of pursuing a model for self-governance similar to Isla Vista’s.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 proposes the formation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. While unincorporated areas such as I.V. and Castro Valley receive municipal services from their county, a CSD is governed by a board of local representatives that decide what services to provide to residents using local tax revenue.</p>\n<p>Traditionally CSD’s are formed through Local Agency Formation Commissions (LAFCO), but both unincorporated areas have found that LAFCO’s model for a CSD does not fit each area’s respective needs. AB 3 bypasses LAFCO by establishing a CSD though state-level legislation. Castro Valley Matters, a group advocating for self-governance in the northern California community, have been closely following the bill, which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law last week.</p>\n<p>According to Castro Valley Matters President Michael Kusiak, the group has followed AB 3 since Williams first introduced the bill to the Assembly in December 2014.</p>\n<p>“We’re kind of crazy people up in northern California who have been following what’s been happening down in Santa Barbara and Isla Vista,” Kusiak said.</p>\n<p>An I.V. CSD as outlined in AB 3 would be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills. Kusiak said a UUT is an “innovative means” of funding self-governance in unincorporated areas, because LAFCO often rejects CSD proposals on the basis that they are not financially feasible.</p>\n<p>“Our contention is that any unincorporated community that tries to go to LAFCO at this point will be told, ‘Actually, no, you’re not fiscally viable,’” Kusiak said. “Isla Vista is really special. It’s really interesting. That’s why we at Castro Valley Matters are following it.”</p>\n<p>Castro Valley Matters Vice President Michael Baldwin said the group is interested in a “virtual town” model, which combines a CSD, a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and an Area Planning Commission (APC). According to Baldwin, no area has attempted this model, but I.V. is “as close as it comes.”</p>\n<p>“I was advocating to have a ‘virtual town’ model, which is basically what you guys did — to have a CSD that covers the whole town,” Baldwin said. “Nobody has ever done all three together — no ‘virtual town’ model.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said the self-governance process in Castro Valley has been “a lot slower” than in I.V., and their few group meetings have led to participants “talking in circles.”</p>\n<p>“It’s the opposite of what’s going on down there,” Baldwin said. “You guys got together and figured something out and pushed it through.”</p>\n<p>Kusiak said AB 3 can serve as an example of local governance for unincorporated areas that are unable to attain cityhood.</p>\n<p>“I think it sets a precedent not just for Castro Valley but for all unincorporated communities,” Kusiak said. “I know it only applies to Isla Vista, but it tells our state legislature that unincorporated communities can be given alternatives.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said when he called William’s office after AB 3 was introduced, staffers told him not to market the bill as a model for other unincorporated areas seeking self-governance for fear it would invite opposition.</p>\n<p>“They kind of said, ‘Oh no. Don’t publish that actually. We don’t want people to think its precedent even though it kind of is,’” Baldwin said. “They were worried that if the legislature saw it as a precedent they might not pass it.”</p>\n<p>Williams said some are “scared to death” AB 3 will pave the way for other areas to circumvent LAFCO when working toward self-governance.</p>\n<p>“I will tell you that, with the opposition to AB 3, much of it was based on that it could be precedent setting,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill was specially made for I.V. and he does not intend to replace the LAFCO process throughout California.</p>\n<p>“At no time in this effort have we taken on or criticized the LAFCO process for the entire state,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said Castro Valley Matters’ support demonstrates I.V.’s role as a progressive and innovative unincorporated area.</p>\n<p>“As far as governance for an unincorporated community, it shows that our community is a very forward-thinking one,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said I.V. should support other unincorporated areas such as Castro Valley.</p>\n<p>“I think it would be important for Isla Vista to share its experience now to other communities who need that help,” Abboud said</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 only seeks approval of I.V. residents, not in the recognition of those outside the area.</p>\n<p>“The real legitimacy of the government doesn’t rest with people outside the community,” Williams said. “It rests with the people in the community making the decisions themselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65300\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65300\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/castro-valley-ca-shows-similar-interest-in-following-i-v-s-self-governance-model/","id":4632,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4631,4630,4629],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":6,"route":"/authors/30"}},"__N_SSG":true}
