The distinction joins his other honors of being elected to the National Academy of Inventors in 2013 and as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012.</p>\n<p>Mitragotri said he won academy membership because of the advancements he and his research group made in treating patients through medicinal patches on the skin instead of injection with needles.</p>\n<p>“[NAE membership is] really a sort of validation and a culmination of the value of the work that we have been doing,” Mitragotri said. “It’s an encouragement to continue on the same path.”</p>\n<p>According to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Mitragotri is well-deserving of the prestigious election.</p>\n<p>“Election to the Academy by one’s peers is one of the highest recognitions for an engineer, an acknowledgment of outstanding and pioneering research,” Yang said. “This distinction joins a long list of Samir’s other well-deserved honors and accomplishments.”</p>\n<p>Mitragotri said he believes a large part of his recognition is due to the students and research group members who work with him.</p>\n<p>“I really want to thank my students and my research group,” Mitragotri said. “They are the ones who do the hard work on a day-to-day basis, and the work that is recognized is really their doing.”</p>\n<p>With his membership, Mitragotri said he looks forward to conferring with other engineers on making decisions for the future of the engineering field.</p>\n<p>“It’s really an opportunity to participate in the future discussions of engineering at the national level,” Mitragotri said, “That could really be the key benefit and the key outcome of this election.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemical engineering major Zach Sawaya said Mitragotri’s election is unsurprising, given the reputation of the university’s engineering programs.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t surprise me in the slightest, but it makes me very excited,” Sawaya said. “This appointment is simply an indication of the excellent faculty and students … and a reason we have one of the top chemical engineering departments in the country.”</p>\n<p>“Really, it’s representative of UCSB science as a whole,” Sawaya said. “We are a top science university.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

for assaulting a UCSB Police Department (UCPD) police officer on the evening of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-14/video-footage-of-deltopia-riot-in-isla-vista/\">the Deltopia riots</a>, has been scheduled for trial on March 24 and faces charges of assault, resisting arrest and causing great bodily injury.</p>\n<p>Edwards, who was 17 years old at the time of his arrest in April and is now being tried as an adult, allegedly struck UCPD police officer Tony Magaña in the face with a backpack containing glass bottles of liquor after being pursued by authorities down the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive on April 5. The incident sparked onlookers to begin throwing rocks and bottles at deputies who came to provide reinforcement and ultimately degenerated into a full scale riot between revelers and police, ending with police shutting down DP and firing on crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year financial math and statistics and French double major Sophie Talbot said she had just woken up from a nap when the Deltopia riots broke out and stayed inside her house on the 6500 block of DP while she watched the violence unfold.</p>\n<p>“[Edwards] should be treated as a criminal that assaulted a police officer and also as someone who ruined a community as a whole,” Talbot said in an email. “Not only did people get hurt, but it also completely screwed up a place we call home.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair and second-year art major Roberto Pérez said Edwards acted ignorantly when he assaulted Magaña.</p>\n<p>“[With] scarring an officer over something as stupid as getting away with his alcohol, he better expect repercussions for his actions,” Pérez said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds. – Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair Roberto Pérez</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Talbot, law enforcement had difficulty controlling the riots because no one could have foreseen the violence that occurred that night.</p>\n<p>“The police and I.V. could have been as prepared as they could have been,” Talbot said in an email. “Never would they have expected someone smashing a bottle on a police officer’s head.”</p>\n<p>Pérez said it is difficult to determine if the riots could have been prevented if Edwards had not assaulted Magaña because of the ambiguity that occurs with large crowds and alcohol.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s hard to say,” Pérez said in an email. “There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he hopes the events that unfolded in April are not repeated in the future.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like to see students be punished, but at the same time I don’t like to see officers be assaulted,” Schunk said. “What I really hope for is in the future we don’t see events like this occurring as often.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he thinks Isla Vista’s adaptive nature will help prevent Deltopia from being as violent as it was last spring.</p>\n<p>“I don’t foresee anything like this occurring again,” Schunk said. “I think that this year there is a collective feeling that we have to kind of change the culture of Deltopia and make it something that won’t bubble over to what it has become.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB also ranked second highest in the UC system for most African-American student applications.</p>\n<p>According to Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services Mary Jacob, the university’s 85,208 applications reflect a larger amount of non-California applicants than ever before, with 18,420 of the applications coming from out-of-state and international students.</p>\n<p>“We continue to attract students from outside California, from other states in the United States,  and even from other countries abroad,” Jacob said. “There’s interest outside of California from people who would like to study here and study specifically at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Jacob said 10,930 of the non-California applications were from international students, exceeding the 7,490 out-of-state applications. She said this is due to the U.S.’s greater availability of higher education in comparison to universities and colleges abroad which tend to be more competitive.</p>\n<p>“American students, no matter where they are, have a range of choices of good quality universities to apply to in the same country, and that may not always be the case for other countries,” Jacob said. “It’s too competitive for them to go to the really good universities in their home country, so they look to study abroad in the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia or Canada if they’re looking to go to an English-speaking country.”</p>\n<p>UCOP spokesperson Shelly Meron said despite California residents’ criticism of UCOP for increasing acceptance of non-Californians, these acceptances are financially necessary as higher out-of-state tuition will allow the UC to provide funding for resident students amidst recent state budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“Admitting non-resident students helps UC subsidize California students and make up for some of the significant cuts in state funding the university has experienced in the last few years,” Meron said. “It’s also important to note that non-resident students are not taking the place of California students at UC; these are separate enrollment targets.”</p>\n<p>Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships Michael M. Miller said the amount of financial aid students receive will not be affected significantly by the larger pool of applicants, as the university will continue to enroll a consistent number of students to allow the university to properly fund them.</p>\n<p>“The campus is really good about hitting all our enrollment targets,” Miller said. “So while enrollment may fluctuate by a couple hundred students here or there, for the most part we know how many students we’re going to have and we can effectively fund them with financial aid. It’s not that big of a deal for financial aid.”</p>\n<p>According to Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop, the increasing number of applicants allows the university to select more academically adept students, leading to an increase in the value of a UCSB degree in the job and graduate school market.</p>\n<p>“The academic prestige of the campus will continue to rise high and you’ll see more high-achieving students in our classrooms,” Przekop said. “It means the value of your UCSB degree will continue to rise as you begin your career and/or apply to graduate programs.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said the only downside accompanying the increase in applicants is that the university will have to deny more students.</p>\n<p>“Competition for admission to UCSB will increase,” Przekop said. “Unfortunately, excellent applicants will be denied admission. It never feels good to deny access to wonderful applicants.”</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, the increase in applications can be attributed to the university’s growing public relations efforts, including an increased social media presence, a recently added virtual campus tour to the admissions website and the presence of more visits from California high schools and community colleges than in the previous year.</p>\n<p>“We have been more visible and active in our California outreach efforts,” Przekop said. “This fall we visited approximately 100 more schools in California than last year.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said the greater number of applicants can also be accredited to the university’s recognition worldwide, helped in part by recent Nobel Prize for Physics recipient Shuji Nakamura.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is recognized by top student scholars as a world-class university,” Przekop said. “We have a new Nobel Prize winner, which certainly drew global attention.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he attributes the record amount of applications to the university’s highly ranked education, prominent diversity, effective research and faculty.</p>\n<p>“This year’s record number of applications is a testament to UC Santa Barbara’s stature as a world leader in academic excellence and diversity, cutting-edge research and innovative teaching,” Yang said. “We are proud to be a campus of choice for talented and high-achieving students with diverse backgrounds who enrich our community.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, January 15, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Villanueva said the president’s executive order and DACA have provided her with opportunities that might have not otherwise been available to an undocumented student.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of people who advocated tirelessly for [Obama’s executive order] including myself and a lot of people I know,” Villanueva said. “DACA has been great for me because I can get a job now and it makes it a lot easier for me to get involved in advocating for the immigrant community.”</p>\n<p>But Villanueva said the new immigration policy still leaves her fearing for her parents, worrying whether or not they will be deported.</p>\n<p>“It won’t really change much for me because my parents won’t be safe from deportations,” Villanueva said. “They will still be vulnerable because local enforcement will still be collaborating with [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement], and the detention and deportation quotas have not changed under this new executive order.”</p>\n<p>According to Villanueva, the executive order’s inability to provide protection to the remainder of Isla Vista’s undocumented population is a reflection of the continuing inadequacy of immigration policy.</p>\n<p>“I know a lot of folks who don’t qualify for [DACA] for a lot of different reasons,” Villanueva said. “For me, that highlights how much our community is still in danger of unjust detention and deportation.”</p>\n<p>Adriana, a third-year English major and undocumented student whose name has been changed on condition of anonymity, said she would stress constantly over the possibility of being deported before she applied for DACA. Adriana said she remembers the fear she felt in one situation when she had a run-in with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) while traveling from Arizona to Los Angeles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59047\" style=\"width: 343px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59047\" data-attachment-id=\"59047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12-04-2014-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=2832%2C4256&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2832,4256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1417639606\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"19\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0769230769231\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"undocumented by kenneth song for 12.04.2014 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59047\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1-681x1024.jpg?resize=333%2C500\" alt=\"undocumented by kenneth song for 12.04.2014 1\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?resize=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 681w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Many undocumented students struggle with fear of deportation and finding work, but DACA may allow them to breathe easier — at least for the remainder of Obama’s term. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I was so scared when that happened,” Adriana said. “But luckily the immigration officer was nice. He let us go because I told him I was returning home.”<br>\nAccording to Adriana, since applying to DACA she no longer worries about being deported and is able to live her life more freely by going to school, working a job and traveling without fear.</p>\n<p>“I can come out of the shadows,” Adriana said. “I’m not afraid to travel and I’ve been traveling back and forth from Isla Vista to Los Angeles.”</p>\n<p>Oscar Zarate, a second-year economics and political science major and an undocumented student, said his status has made it difficult for him to afford college because of his limited eligibility to scholarships and financial aid. According to Zarate, he can now obtain the work permit necessary to find a job to help pay for a postsecondary education as a result of Obama’s executive order.</p>\n<p>“Due to Obama’s new immigration policies, I can work which is a big help,” Zarate said. “Now I can be a desk attendant, and that helps a lot with college expenses.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Martinez, a second-year sociology and math major and an undocumented student, said she sees the extension of DACA eligibility and work permit opportunities as positive, but still worries because the added protection for undocumented immigrants will only last for the remaining two years of Obama’s presidency.</p>\n<p>“Obama’s presidency is slowly coming to an end, so there is still that concern of what is going to happen when a new president comes into office,” Martinez said. “I don’t know what kind of legislation the new president will try to implement.”</p>\n<p>Zarate said he also shares the concern that Obama’s new immigration orders are only temporary.</p>\n<p>“These immigration policies that have been applied are not forever,” Zarate said. “I fear for the future of the undocumented student.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, December 4, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59045\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59045\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/","id":3440,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3439,3438,3437],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Food Truck Cinema To Provide Free Food, Movie","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB First will host Food Truck Cinema tomorrow at 7:30p.m. on the UCen Lawn to advocate student donation to the university after graduation.

Hamner said philanthropy is essential to helping raise UCSB’s national ranking.</p>\n<p>“We really encourage students to give back to the school once they graduate,” Hamner said. “Even if a student gives one dollar or five dollars, it ups our ranking because it shows alumni involvement.”</p>\n<p>According to Fenton, UCSB First will also use Food Truck Cinema as a platform to announce the senior class gift, which was voted upon by members of this year’s senior class. The winning result, Fenton said, will determine which of three options on the ballot will have a fund opened on its behalf at the end of the school year: Associated Students Food Bank, A.S. Academic Resource Fund or the Student Safety Enhancement Fund.</p>\n<p>“[A senior class gift] is an opportunity for seniors to create a legacy and stay connected with their alma mater,” Fenton said. “UC Santa Barbara is a strong community, and giving to this gift demonstrates our firm belief in Gauchos helping Gauchos.”</p>\n<p>UCSB First is also partnering with the Associate Students Food Bank by recommending that attendees bring canned food donations to the event, according to A.S. Food Bank coordinator and alumna Tuyen Nguyen.</p>\n<p>Nguyen also said 10 percent of the proceeds from the food trucks will also go to A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p>“If there is something in the back of your pantry that you are willing and able to part with, it could always be used to help other students who utilize our pantry,” Nguyen said. “We also encourage [buying food] in whatever capacity people can engage and be able to give back.”</p>\n<p>Food Truck Cinema, Fenton said, will also be hosting tabling from various student organizations like Dance Marathon, Active Minds, DJ Club and the Education Abroad Program.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to provide more fun things for students to do,” Fenton said. “This is an opportunity for students to learn more about their campus and where they can get involved in.”</p>\n<p>According to Hamner, deciding what movie to screen was a difficult decision due to factors like appropriateness and popularity.</p>\n<p>“It actually took such a long time to pick a movie because we wanted to do a film that everyone would like and be able to relate to,” Hamner said.</p>\n<p>In the end, “Anchorman” was the right choice, according to Fenton.</p>\n<p>“We thought it was a fun movie and kind of nostalgic to most people,” Fenton said. “Plus everyone loves Will Ferrell.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the event would provide free food to attendees.

EVPLA-elect Cameron Schunk will hold an Isla Vista self-governance forum today from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. at the I.V. Food Co-Op. <em>Kevin Chan/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee-elect Jonathan Abboud and Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs-elect Cameron Schunk will hold a forum presenting their vision for <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/comment-page-1/\">Isla Vista self-governance</a> today from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. at the I.V. Food Co-Op.</p>\n<p>I.V. is currently the largest unincorporated community under the direct governmental supervision of Santa Barbara County, and plans for its self-governance have been in the works throughout this past year, especially in light of past violent events such as Deltopia and the May 23 shootings. Among the different options on the table for potential forms of self-governance for I.V. — including the establishment of a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/self-governance-in-isla-vista-an-uncertain-future/\">Community Services District (CSD)</a>, the establishment of a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and cityhood — Abboud, Schunk and other self-governance advocates support establishing I.V. as a form of CSD.</p>\n<p>Initially presented to A.S. and county officials by recent graduate Josh Plotke, a CSD would absorb the I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVPRD) — currently the only governing body within I.V. — as well as County Service Area No. 31 and provide a number of services funded through a utility users tax.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Coalition member and comparative literature graduate student Shari Sanders, many residents believe they do not have a voice in decisions made for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The number one thing people are saying is that they don’t have access to the decisions that are made in Isla Vista that are affecting them directly,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>According to Sanders, this disconnect stems from a lack of adequate representation for I.V. at the county level.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have our own kind of officials that are enfolded inside the county,” Sanders said. “We have an enormously difficult time holding anybody accountable for things that they say they will do for us.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine if we had the ability to install our own improved bluff fencing … The discussions about the fence could also occur in Isla Vista, instead of miles away at 9 a.m. on a Wednesday in a sterile county office building. — Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said April’s Deltopia riots exemplify the difficulties faced by I.V. when there is little student-to-county communication on how to deal with large, potentially dangerous events.</p>\n<p>“Students were tear gassed and civil unrest broke out on Deltopia because there was no cohesive plan with how to deal with the event,” Schunk said. “There was no cooperation from the county, largely.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, having an autonomous governmental entity in I.V. based off of a CSD will allow I.V. residents to leverage more power in the community via tax dollars spent on local projects.</p>\n<p>“We wouldn’t be waiting in line, or trying to entice the county to play favorites and spend money on us,” Schunk said. “We’d be able to spend the tax dollars on ourselves, on projects that were agreed upon at the local level.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58247\" style=\"width: 413px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"135838197\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58241\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58247\" data-attachment-id=\"58247\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/town-hall-meeting-st-marks-parish_kenneth-song_10-09-1024x680/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,680\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412710004\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"90\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024×680\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58247\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?resize=403%2C268\" alt=\"Community members presented options such as a Municipal Advisory Council, Community Services District and cityhood.

It’s like a one-size-fits-all,” Abboud said. “That size doesn’t fit Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>That being said, I.V. self-governance advocates such as Abboud and Schunk are pushing for a CSD “custom made” for I.V.</p>\n<p>“We want take some of the ideas of the CSD law and then write a new law that’s specially catered to Isla Vista’s needs,” Abboud said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re writing a skeleton version of the bill, and then we’re going to give that to them for the staff in the capitol to actually write it.  — Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk and Abboud said they have been working on drafting the “new law” with the intent of having it introduced into the California state legislature this December by Assemblyman Das Williams and State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.</p>\n<p>“We’ve met with them a lot about introducing the legislation and they’re both supportive,” Abboud said. “We’re writing a skeleton version of the bill, and then we’re going to give that to them for the staff in the capitol to actually write it.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said that if the would-be bill is enacted into state law, the next step will be to apply through the county to have a measure passed that calls for the establishment of a special district on the ballot in the next county-wide election.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58245\" style=\"width: 424px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"588370579\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58241\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58245\" data-attachment-id=\"58245\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/iv_photos_johnclow_11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=3000%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1358266877\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"IV_Photos_JohnClow_11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58245\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11-1024x682.jpg?resize=414%2C276\" alt=\"Schunk and Abboud hope to eventually see a measure passed that calls for the establishment of a special district on the ballot in the next county-wide election.

Part of the drafting process for this law will involve I.V. community input. <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to him, part of the drafting process for the law involves holding public forums to receive public input on the intended form of government, with meetings to be held by Schunk and Abboud.</p>\n<p>“We hold public discussions to get more specific input so we can finish writing the bill,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>The Committee for a New Isla Vista (CNIV) is another entity working towards self-governance for Isla Vista. Chairman of CNIV Eric Hutchins said his group has been excluded from “these discussions.”</p>\n<p>“We have repeatedly suggested that we be invited to participate in panel discussions on ‘How to learn from past mistakes’ and ‘How to succeed in the present political and demographic environment of Isla Vista,’” Hutchins said.  “All to no avail.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The issues that I see with the Community Service District and the Municipal Advisory Council are that the Community Service District is not allowed to change the rules about how this area works. All these things require rule changes.  — Jay Freeman</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Hutchins, the CNIV proposes a local government that involves an “inclusive democracy,” governed by a body that would be called “Isla Vista New Community Alliance.” The governing representatives would be elected by residents and five major groups: property owners, business owners, special service districts, the County of Santa Barbara and UCSB and SBCC administrations, faculty and students. But according to Hutchins, his ideas for self-governance have been mostly ruled out by much of the I.V. population.</p>\n<p>“So far, it appears that [the CNIV] has been missed by student and community activists,” Hutchins said, “and our point-of-view dismissed without thoughtful engagement or consideration.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the disconnect between the CNIV and the rest of the community may stem from their preference for an advisory group to “provide perspective based on their efforts decades ago.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen CNIV move forward with ideas after receiving very little input from community members. They seek to dictate the terms of self-governance themselves,” Schunk said. “We need the involvement of every single group.”</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident, local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-07-23/i-v-community-discusses-self-governance/\">complete cityhood</a> for I.V. would be the best option for self-governance.

On Wednesday, the UMC’s Judicial Council — the church’s highest court — held a hearing in Memphis, Tennessee, to determine whether or not a lower appeals court acted properly in restoring Schaefer his reverendship status in June of this year. The prosecuting clergy member in Schaefer’s case, the Rev. Christopher Fisher of the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, brought an appeal to the Council in July, stating, among other reasons, that the lower appeals court “wrongly crafted” its own penalty rather than “remanding” it back to the trial court to determine the penalty.</p>\n<p>The Judicial Council’s final decision was announced on its website yesterday morning and states that the church’s Jurisdictional Committee on Appeals operated accordingly in its decision to reverse the lower court’s penalty on Schaefer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The Judicial Council … finds there are no errors in the application of the church law and judicial decisions,” the UMC press release stated. “The penalty as modified by the Committee on Appeals stands.”</p>\n<p>Schaefer said he is grateful to keep his status as a reverend.</p>\n<p>“I feel relieved.

We don’t see it having an impact on the separate issue of equal access to civil marriage in the United States.”</p>\n<p>University United Methodist Church musician Ethan Bertrand said he is ultimately optimistic.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important that we’re moving in this direction,” Bertrand said. “The church needs to be more open, and this is a great place to start.”</p>\n<p>Prosecutor Reverend Christopher Fisher declined to comment last night on the hearing.</p>\n<p>If Schaefer is defrocked, he said he would still serve at the United Methodist Church in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The day after I got defrocked, Bishop [Minerva] Carcano told me, ‘We believe you here in California,’” Schaefer said. “Even if I get defrocked again, she promised to keep me in the church.”</p>\n<p>This “promise” would be upheld in one of two ways, he said.</p>\n<p>“I will either change my status to church administrator or seek reordination through the California conference,” Schaefer said.</p>\n<p>According to the United Methodist Church Judicial Council’s website, a decision is not expected to be announced until several days after the full meeting concludes on Oct. 25.</p>\n<p>Most people, according to Coleman, are hoping for a ruling that is universally fair.</p>\n<p>“The most desirable outcome is a just resolution,” Coleman said. “We need a compromise that achieves justice for both sides.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Schaefer had appealed the ruling. This is not correct. Schaefer had his ruling appealed by another party.]</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57253\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57253\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/i-v-pastor-appeals-to-keep-title/","id":3458,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3457,3456,3455],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":6,"highestPage":6,"route":"/authors/30"}},"__N_SSG":true}
