Community Services District (CSD) board president who led the march, said he saw the parade as a glimpse into the future of what Deltopia could be.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that everyone appreciated, and it was all fun, all positive,” he said. “That got me thinking, ‘Hey, if there’s more planned programming, I think that’s really the first step toward a ‘sanctioned Deltopia.’”</p>\n<p>Bertrand and other I.V. stakeholders have, for the past few years, proposed the idea of making Deltopia a sanctioned event. Rather than having the informal Spring Break celebration, they hope that someday Deltopia could be a planned festival of sorts — one with alcohol vending, booked performances or perhaps more Mardi Gras marches.</p>\n<p>“I think that it will be really important for us moving forward instead of just trying to see Deltopia as a problem we can put a Band-Aid on from a law enforcement perspective,” said Spencer Brandt, who also serves as a director on the CSD board.</p>\n<p>UCPD sent in approximately 70 officers into I.V. this weekend, the lowest in recent years, considering that police have had as many as 300 officers in town during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“We need to be doing what we can to bring it out into the open and regulate it,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he envisions a Deltopia where organizers are “distributing wristbands, having music in the parks [and] selling alcohol out in an open place where it is regulated and we know who is able to purchase it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76839\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76839\" data-attachment-id=\"76839\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-11/in-photos-deltopia-weekend-2017/deltopia-by-mclane/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopia by McLane\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-76839 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76839\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some on the I.V.

Officers arrested over 100 residents, according to police estimates.</p>\n<p>The riots led to broad discussion of the possibility of instituting a sanctioned Deltopia. Abboud said it was a primary issue in the last quarter of his A.S. presidency.</p>\n<p>“This was actually a very, very widely popular, talked-about issue in the few weeks following the riots,” he said. “[We thought,] let’s sanction it and make it work, you know? For the benefit for the community.”</p>\n<p>The idea lost momentum in A.S., however, at the occurrence of the May 23, 2014, shooting, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>While no stakeholders have officially sanctioned a Deltopia festival, UCSB student groups have developed programming around the informal celebration in efforts to increase the safety of students during the weekend.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board has, for the past three years, hosted an on-campus concert called The Warm Up, and the A.S. Public Safety Commission started a volunteer program called UC Isla Vista (UCIV) in 2015 in which students act as mediators between residents and police.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76921\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76921\" data-attachment-id=\"76921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopiaextra – mclanebrown\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-76921\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sanctioned Deltopia could mean one with alcohol vendors, booked musical performances and Mardi Gras-like marches.

A sanctioned Deltopia is an idea he is open to, he said.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t sound like bad thing,” he said. “This is my first year here, so I can’t really compare to anything else — like if it’d be a step up from something — but it doesn’t seem like a bad idea.”</p>\n<p>Brenda Cruz, a third-year communication major, said she thinks having a Deltopia festival would be “a lot more fun” and “a little more safe.”</p>\n<p>“Having it like an actual festival would be really fun [and] it’d be more controlled alcohol-wise, too, like being able to buy different kinds of alcohol, besides having just cheap stuff,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/","id":4421,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4420,4419,4418],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Inspiring Student, Role Model Passes at Age 25","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-10-at-5.55.05-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-10-at-5.55.05-PM.png?resize=635%2C368&ssl=1","description":"Ismael Hernandez transferred from SBCC and was prepared to graduate from UCSB in June with a degree in biology.

It was a dream come true.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez had a “wakeup call” at the age of 17, she said, when his mother passed away around the same time he faced incarceration in juvenile hall. He attended his mother’s funeral in handcuffs, and he realized soon after that he needed to change his life for the sake of his three younger siblings.</p>\n<p>“He knew that if he continued on the path of delinquency or anything like that, it wouldn’t lead him to be a great role model for his siblings,” Rodriguez said. “At the end of the day, that’s what his mom wanted him to be; she wanted him to go to school and do great things.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez later graduated from a continuation high school and went on to enroll in Transitions, a program at SBCC which seeks to provide educational opportunities to individuals released from the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>Noel Gomez, a Transitions program counselor, remembers Hernandez telling the class on the first day that he was going to graduate from SBCC with a degree in biological sciences, go on to UCSB and become a doctor.</p>\n<p>“I can’t tell you how many times I hear that from a lot of students. Within a semester, students drop out or they don’t carry on with their goals. He actually went on and did it,” Gomez said.<br>\nFrom then on, everyone in the class started calling him “the doctor,” Gomez said. Hernandez valued hard work and would often study in the library for hours on end.</p>\n<p>“He couldn’t understand why people would come to SBCC and not focus on school,” Gomez said. “He took that as an opportunity that a lot of people don’t have, and he wanted to use it.”</p>\n<p>After five years at SBCC, Hernandez became the first in his family to graduate from college. He applied and got accepted into his dream school, UCSB, where he continued his studies in biology.</p>\n<p>His classmate and close friend Kathy Lopez said he kept to his diligent study habits, which he had maintained at SBCC. He volunteered in the emergency room at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, and he had plans to go to nursing school after graduation.</p>\n<p>Lopez said she and Hernandez would often hang out together after their biology classes. She said he would always want to stop by Root 217 in the UCen so that he could get “that fish sandwich he always wanted.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said one of the fondest memories she has with Hernandez is when they were reflecting on graduation by the UCSB Lagoon.</p>\n<p>“We were walking over past the lagoon — it was a really nice day, actually, and the lagoon didn’t smell so bad either — and he just looked over at the lagoon and was like, ‘Kathy, we actually did this; we’re actually here and we’re actually graduating. We made it,’” she said, adding that the two of them paid a visit to Root 217 soon after.</p>\n<p>Hernandez worked as a cashier at a liquor store to support his education and family. His sister, Karinna Hernandez, said he often told customers that he would take care of them when he became a doctor.</p>\n<p>His sister also said he greatly valued his family and that he especially loved his nieces.</p>\n<p>“He used to love being with my kids,” she said. “Every time he saw them, he would always give them kisses, and he’d always hold my oldest daughter and tell her he could bless her. He would always kiss her hand and tell her it was his blessing.”</p>\n<p>Karinna Hernandez said her brother became a role model for the family. She said he often encouraged her to prioritize her education, helping her pick her classes at SBCC and advising her to sit at the front of her classes.</p>\n<p>“He was a caring person with a big heart,” she said. “His smile was something that I think nobody can forget. He was such a loving person.”</p>\n<p>Friends and family held a funeral service for Hernandez on March 16 at Our Lady of Guadalupe in Santa Barbara. He was buried with his bachelor’s degree in biological sciences.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76689\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76689\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/","id":2422,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2421,2420,2419],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Presence Declines as Deltopia Dwindles","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/police2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/police2.jpg?resize=980%2C451&ssl=1","description":"Police presence during Deltopia will continue to decline this year following dropping attendance levels over the past three years.

Rob Romero said. He said they will be predominantly from southern California UC campuses such as UCLA, UC Irvine, UC San Diego and UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Romero said UCPD had approximately 100 police officers at Deltopia last year.</p>\n<p>This year will also be the first year that UCPD is not installing fencing along El Colegio Road and around residence halls, as the Nexus previously reported.</p>\n<p>Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, said she could not disclose how many officers the Sheriff’s Office will be sending into I.V. this weekend for “safety and security reasons.” She said, however, that there will be less law enforcement personnel than in years past.</p>\n<p>Hoover said the Sheriff’s Office will keep its crowd-control horses “on standby” this weekend, as it did last year.</p>\n<p>“There will still be a strong law enforcement presence. There hasn’t been a dramatic reduction in staff, but we are responding to what we’re seeing, which is a lower number each year, dramatically lower,” she said. “It would be a bit unreasonable to have an unnecessary number of law enforcement in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Police said Deltopia 2016 had a maximum attendance of 3,500 people, a significant decrease from 10,000 attendees in 2015 and 25,000 attendees in 2014.</p>\n<p>The Sheriff’s Office recorded 48 citations and 45 arrests during Deltopia last year, down from 140 citations and 102 arrests in 2015. There were 190 citations and 130 arrests during Deltopia 2014, police said.</p>\n<p>The county festival ordinance will be in place this weekend, prohibiting residents from playing amplified music between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. from Friday to Monday.</p>\n<p>Volunteers from UCIV, a group formed by the Associated Students Public Safety Commission, will ring doorbells and warn Isla Vistans against violating the festival ordinance to prevent police encounters.</p>\n<p>UCSB spent approximately $36,000 on advertisements urging partygoers to stay away from I.V. during Deltopia weekend, university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Estrada said $1,410 of that amount purchased two print ads in the Nexus and $347 purchased an online ad with Mustang News, the student newspaper at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. UCSB’s Office of Public Affairs projects said it has spent approximately $34,000 for digital ads on Facebook, Pandora and Instagram running in areas from San Diego to Paso Robles.</p>\n<p>The university will be enforcing parking restrictions during the weekend. Campus parking officials will be closing all parking lots except Lots 22, 18 and 16.</p>\n<p>Visitors will not be allowed to park in UCSB lots from 11 a.m. Friday to 7:30 a.m. Monday. Only drivers with valid permits are authorized to park on campus.</p>\n<p>The university will also be enforcing a no-guest policy in residence halls from 12 p.m. Friday to 12 p.m. Monday.</p>\n<p>Students will host several alternative programs in and around I.V. during the weekend, including roller skating at the Recreation Center and a concert featuring popular EDM artist RL Grime at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs, said there are talks of making Deltopia a sanctioned event. He said, however, that for now, residents want it to be a locals-only celebration with programming developed around it.</p>\n<p>“This Deltopia seems … to be the mark point where, if this goes well, then people are really going to start considering what’s next,” he said. “I think after this year, there’ll be a lot more changes, and I think [we] will have an ability to develop new ways of approaching it.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76694\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/police-decline-as-deltopia-dwindles/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76694\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/police-decline-as-deltopia-dwindles/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/police-decline-as-deltopia-dwindles/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/police-decline-as-deltopia-dwindles/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/police-decline-as-deltopia-dwindles/","id":4447,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4446,4445,4444],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Detained Skateboarder Faces Resisting Arrest Charges","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Skateboarder-detainment.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Skateboarder-detainment.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A UC Santa Barbara student whose forceful detainment in the Arbor went viral two weeks ago will be going to court during Spring Break to face charges of resisting arrest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UC Santa Barbara student whose forceful detainment in the Arbor went viral two weeks ago will be going to court during Spring Break to face charges of resisting arrest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County District Attorney filed the case of Erin Morgan, a fourth-year zoology major, with the Santa Barbara Superior Court on Monday, setting her court date for the morning of Mar. 27.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD officers arrested Morgan on Feb. 27 after she allegedly attempted to flee from receiving a citation for illegally skateboarding through the Arbor. The video of Morgan’s detainment, which went viral on Facebook in the days following the arrest, shows two UCPD officers in the Arbor taking Morgan down to her knees and then down to the ground on her stomach.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF591SOtago?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCPD spokesperson Sgt. Rob Romero, the two UCPD officers instructed Morgan to stop skateboarding and to wait as they handed her a citation. Romero said she waited “for maybe close to half a minute” before grabbing her skateboard and riding in the opposite direction from which she originally came.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the officers yelled at her to stop, but she continued to go. According to Romero, an officer then ran after her, grabbed the back of her backpack and took her to the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Romero, the officer tried to get her to place her hands behind her back, but instead she tried to stand up. He said when the second officer came to assist, they each grabbed one of her arms because she was trying to get up and then they “forcibly” took her to the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taking somebody to ground — if you ever played any type of sport or if you wrestled or anything like that — when you use force, it’s not pretty,” he said the day after the incident. “It’s not something we wish we have to use on people we arrest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Feb. 28, Morgan confirmed she tried to ride away from receiving her citation, but she said she did not expect the officers would use force to detain her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My biggest concern is just how quickly it came to that,” she said. “I didn’t think that just me skateboarding away would result in me getting thrown to the ground.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan also said she was booked in the county jail on the night of her arrest, and after paying a $2,500 bail, she returned home early the next day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Tuesday that she does not intend to challenge the charges of resisting arrest, but said she does intend to speak to a civil attorney about the forcible detainment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I walked away from him and that’s against the law. So I’m not going to try to fight that,” she said Tuesday. “He violated my civil rights. You can’t just throw someone to the ground for rolling away from a police officer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court records, authorities have charged Morgan for violating California Penal Code 148(a)(1). The law holds that a person who “willfully resists, delays or obstructs” a police officer shall receive a fine no greater than $1,000, a county jail sentence no longer than a year or both the fine and imprisonment.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Iranian immigrants, “it’s never going to be safe” to live in the United States <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Maryam Rasekh sat in front of a computer in Iran on Jan. 27, rapidly refreshing her computer screen to determine whether she could return to Santa Barbara and complete a graduate degree.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump had issued an executive order hours earlier banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. As news began spreading throughout the affected countries, Rasekh learned firsthand that she was one of three UCSB students barred from reentering the U.S.</p>\n<p>For one month following the executive order, Rasekh remained at her home in Iran, unable to return to her studies at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The worst thing about it was the rollercoaster,” she told the <em>Nexus</em> in an interview Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Her first instinct was to wait. She said she had heard “horror stories” of immigrants waiting in limbo at U.S. airports as Customs and Border Protection agents denied visas that many of them had waited months — or even years — to attain.</p>\n<p>All she did was write an email to the embassy asking what had happened.</p>\n<p>Over a week later, a federal appeals court lifted the travel ban. The U.S. embassy responded to her email saying she would receive a visa once again.</p>\n<p>When she obtained her first visa to the United States in 2013, Rasekh had traveled on plane to Ankara, Turkey, the nearest U.S. embassy to Iran. Because Rasekh did not want to make the trip again in early February, she paid a visit to an Iranian travel agency to request they go on her behalf.</p>\n<p>When she returned home from the agency, Rasekh looked on her computer and found another response from the U.S. embassy. The officials told her to “hold off, disregard the previous email and just wait.”</p>\n<p>“I was still scared, [thinking] ‘will they mark it as rejected? What will they do?’” she said.</p>\n<p>Almost another week passed by until the embassy had updated her visa status again. On Feb. 16, the U.S. embassy once again assured her the valid visa that Trump’s travel ban had denied.</p>\n<p>Rasekh returned to UCSB last Monday, Feb. 27, just days before Trump issued a modified executive order on March 6, lifting some restrictions and cementing others.</p>\n<p>The new travel ban allows entry for current U.S. visa holders and refugees who have already been granted asylum and removes travel restrictions from Iraq. Students with J visas, such as Rasekh, will be allowed entry. The ban will go into effect March 16.</p>\n<p>“I scraped past,” she said, adding that many of her family and friends may remain unable to enter the U.S. in the months to come.</p>\n<p>Rasekh’s return last Monday marks the third time she has made the trip to the U.S. She first came to UCSB in February 2013 to join as a researcher in the electrical engineering department.</p>\n<p>It was during her time as a researcher that she met her boyfriend Hassan Arbabi, a fellow Iranian and researcher in the mechanical engineering department. Arbabi acted as a correspondent to the <em>Nexus</em> on Rasekh’s behalf when she was barred in early February.</p>\n<p>“He was actually more stressed out than me. Even when the ban was lifted, he was like, ‘Don’t come on Monday; come on Sunday because you don’t know, maybe he’ll sign a new one,’” she said. “He was really trying to shield me from all his stress and anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Rasekh said her sister, who studies at Boston University, was also worried for Rasekh during Trump’s travel ban. She even tried to put Rasekh in touch with Joe Kennedy, the U.S. Congressman out of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>“Everybody here was more stressed out than I think myself,” Rasekh said.</p>\n<p>For the two weeks since her return, Rasekh has been continuing her research in the engineering labs. Because of her prolonged stay in Iran, Rasekh missed a conference on Feb. 21, where she was supposed to present her research, and she was unable to enroll for courses in the Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“I arrived too late,” she said.</p>\n<p>Rasekh still expects to receive her Ph.D. in April, although she is unsure whether she will stay in the U.S. after that point.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if U.S. still looks like a good prospect for living,” she said. “I think it’s in the back of all Iranians’ minds that maybe we should plan long-term on somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>She said Trump’s latest actions lead her to believe that, for Iranian immigrants, “it’s never going to be safe” to live in the United States.</p>\n<p>“And it’s not just laws. Just the general atmosphere; if it’s going to keep going toward all this tension, then it’s bad for everybody,” she said. “There’s a reason people choose the U.S. to work and live in, and this could be hurting that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Last year’s election season saw the emergence of four new parties: The Response, Peer Action Coalition (P.A.C.), Campus United (CU) and Queer and Trans Student Body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU became the dominant party in April, garnering 64 percent of the Senate and three out of five executive seats. The Response won seven seats on the Senate, and P.A.C. took the remaining two seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would not wish to see something like that happen again. In my opinion, you would have it so that no one has the majority,” said Nawar Nemeh, third-year political science major and Isla Vista Party executive member. “That doesn’t mean we’re not going to try to dominate. That would be stupid of us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nemeh, many of Isla Vista Party’s members were active in P.A.C. and The Response last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an obvious overlap. I don’t think that’s an unfair assessment,” Nemeh said. He added that the party includes students with no previous experience in A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are about 40 active members in the Isla Vista Party, according to Nemeh. He said many of them represent the Black Student Union, El Congreso, Queer Commission, Multicultural Greek Council, UCSB Panhellenic and Inter-Fraternity Council, among other groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how the Isla Vista Party differentiates itself from others, on-campus senator Lesly Silva said the party is “grassroots” and “diverse.” Party members have not yet formed their platform, she said, because they are in the process of gathering input from a range of “historically underrepresented communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We reach out to communities asking, what do you need? … What has been on your mind?” she said. “This is a community-based party.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a second-year global studies major, said party members contacted his group, the Queer Commission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the past, it’s been an afterthought where people have created their parties and then came to the queer communities,” he said. “We really get a say on what the party is doing, and so we get that foundational support instead of support that we would get as an afterthought.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aim of the Isla Vista Party, Nemeh said, is to change the structure of Senate so that students have increased “decision-making power” at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citing the UC shared governance policy, which splits campus responsibility evenly between students, faculty and administration, Nemeh said students have “gotten the short end of the deal recently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want is to make sure that students have an actual decision-making power that’s not just one seat on an advisory committee. We want them to actually be the decision-makers,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Lopez, off-campus senator and third-year sociology and economics double major, said the goal of this party is to elect student government officials who will use the power invested in them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to actually put people in positions where they will have a big influence and will use that influence, rather than putting people into a position because the title sounds nice,” Lopez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nemeh, the name of the party is intended to localize the interests of A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to remind people, what do we actually love? What is actually our home? It’s Isla Vista,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU will continue to run a full slate for this spring election. According to Niki Elyasi, a CU organizer and fourth-year biopsychology major, her party will maintain its same mission and values, even with the formation of a new party.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every year there’s more than one party. It’s definitely more competitive than when there’s only one party running,” she said. “I don’t see that changing Campus United style or Campus United mission. I don’t think you’ll see anything different from us. It’s up to the different parties what you’ll see from them.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/","id":2435,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2434,2433,2432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Alumnus Dies After Falling From Isla Vista Balcony","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/StorkeLogo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/StorkeLogo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The coroner’s office is conducting an investigation to determine the official cause and manner of Yun's death, police said. \r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UC Santa Barbara alumnus died Sunday after falling from an Isla Vista balcony, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office reported.  </span></p>\n<p>Kenneth Yun, 22, was attempting to sit on the railing of a second story balcony on the 800 block of Embarcadero Del Norte when he fell backward at approximately 1:30 a.m., friends who were present at the time told police.</p>\n<p>He then fatally struck his head on the asphalt parking lot below, police said.</p>\n<p>According to a police report, emergency personnel transported Yun to the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital for surgery related to head trauma and internal injuries.

One of these students is an undergraduate from Syria, two are undergraduates from Iran and the remaining 37 are graduate students from Iran.</p>\n<p>According to Janet Afary, a professor of Iranian studies, there is “a great deal of anxiety” among graduate students at UCSB who cannot return to Iran in fear that their visas may not be renewed.</p>\n<p>Leila Zonouzi, an Iranian student pursuing a Ph.D. in global studies, planned to wed her fiance this summer. She said her parents and in-laws are in Iran, but since the executive order halted immigration from that country, they are unable to fly to the U.S. for the wedding.</p>\n<p>“I won’t be able to get married because, well, let’s face it, without our parents, who are we celebrating with?” she said.</p>\n<p>Zonouzi said the travel ban also affects visas for her fiancé’s job and her academic career. Her fiancé, who is also Iranian with a visa expiring in a year, may not apply for an H-1 visa or a green card “if this continues.” Zonouzi has a two-year visa expiring in June 2018 while enrolled in a five- to seven-year program.</p>\n<p>“With this rate of madness, I’m not actually sure I can extend it and be a Ph.D. candidate,” Zonouzi said.</p>\n<p>Another UCSB student affected by the travel ban is Mahdi Golkaram, an Iranian mechanical engineering Ph.D. student who said he won’t be able to see his parents for years. His parents received their visas two weeks ago after applying at the U.S. embassy and undergoing a background check for nine months.</p>\n<p>“Because of the executive order, they can’t come to the United States because anyone from Iran is banned from entering the United States using any passport visa,” Golkaram said.</p>\n<p>The ban has also affected Golkaram’s job opportunities. He said he doesn’t know if he can apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) required for his internship placement this fall since the ban limits requests going through to the USCIS for Iranian people.</p>\n<p>“A lot of companies that I have job offers for right now are contacting me and asking if I know what my visa and resident situation is going to be,” he said. “Even if the companies are fine with me, they will be anxious about whether or not I can accept the job offer.”</p>\n<p>A Reddit user, posting as an Iranian-Canadian UCSB student on Saturday, said he or she was “sent back in Germany” while trying to reenter the U.S. after a trip to Tehran, Iran.</p>\n<p>The Nexus confirmed that Yousefian Jazi and Rasekh did not post on Reddit. The Nexus has sent the Reddit user a private message each day since Saturday, but the user has not yet replied.</p>\n<p>Kraig Rice, an immigration attorney with Juris Doctor California, said Iranian-Canadians would have been denied entry into the U.S on Friday and Saturday. The Trump administration announced Sunday that it would begin to allow entry to Canadian dual citizens.</p>\n<p>The order originally barred all permanent residents and all visas except foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations and G-1, G-2, G-3 and G-4 visas.</p>\n<p>United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began allowing entry to green card holders on Sunday. Those with student visas, however, are still prohibited from entering the country, according to Abbe Kingston, an immigration attorney based in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The craziness is there are already people who have been vetted, have already been interviewed, some on airplanes,” Kingston said. “That’s the hysteria it’s created. No one really thought this plan through.”</p>\n<p>In a press release Saturday, the UC Office of the President advised students from the seven countries listed in the executive order to not travel outside the United States. OISS recommends that all international students avoid travel outside the U.S.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75414\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/","id":2427,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2426,2425,2424],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Solar Origami Takes First at Startup Competition","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1","description":"When Robert Salazar, an origami artist of 16 years, first pitched the idea of marketing an origami solar cooker named Orisun, not too many students could get behind it.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When Robert Salazar, an origami artist of 16 years, first pitched the idea of marketing an origami solar cooker named Orisun, not too many students could get behind it.</p>\n<p>Aspiring entrepreneurs like Salazar were asked to vote on pitches to decide which would become finalists.

So I put all my stickers on.”</p>\n<p>So began the team that would go on to win first place at Startup Weekend, a two-day program on the weekend of Jan. 15-17 in which students launched entrepreneurial projects from scratch.</p>\n<p>Orisun was one of a handful of products to make it to the finals on Sunday, Jan. 17. One team proposed an app called Open, which allows users to keep track of drunk friends. Another group proposed Physique, an app in which users do workouts based on how they want to look.</p>\n<p>The fitness app won third place and Open won second, but the Orisun team placed above the rest because they built a functional prototype on the day of presentation.</p>\n<p>The team developed a simple product: Orisun is a foldable solar reflector able to melt snow on backpacking trips. Users can fold the device into a large cup, and when deployed, Orisun unravels to three-and-a-half feet in diameter. Light rays from the sun hit the shiny Mylar surface, which directs them into a central column for users to heat up water, snow or food.</p>\n<p>Salazar created the circular origami figure made of paper and Mylar on the morning of Sunday, Jan. 17 — the same day the team intended to present. When demonstrated, the Orisun prototype was able to heat up water by one degree every two seconds.</p>\n<p>Judges also commended the Orisun team for making presales and meeting with representatives from REI, Patagonia and National Geographic.</p>\n<p>“We validated our market research maybe a little bit better than others because we actually got money and funding,” Sato said. “That’s one of the best ways to gauge whether people are really going to buy this.”</p>\n<p>She said the team’s competitor sells its product for about $80 to $120, but Orisun can have a market price of $45 to $60. Now, the target market price is somewhere under $100.</p>\n<p>“We have a cheaper solution that has potentially more applications,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75229\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75229\" data-attachment-id=\"75229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/startup-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Startup 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75229\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=800%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Robert Salazar</em></p></div>\n<p>According to the Orisun team, the applications for their product are broad. It serves a recreational purpose, able to assist a lifestyle of backpacking and trekking. Sailors can use Orisun to heat up ocean water for desalination.</p>\n<p>Team member Srikanth Kalluri, a third-year physics major, said he joined the team because he saw the application of Orisun as an assistance to third-world countries. He sees the solar cooker as a means of separating pollutants from water.</p>\n<p>There is still much more work ahead for Orisun. The team wants to build a final model that is “hiking worthy,” according to Kalluri.</p>\n<p>“Just because we pitched something at a local event doesn’t mean it’s finalized,” he said.</p>\n<p>Sato said they need to secure manufacturing for the product and talk to potential partners, an opportunity that has been opened up from the networking done at Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>For teammate Evan Blasband, a second-year electrical engineering major, winning first place at Startup Weekend is “like a dream come true.”</p>\n<p>“You always hear stories about people starting a business when they’re in college,” he said. “I’ve been wanting to do this stuff for like 10 or 15 years now.”</p>\n<p>Salazar likens the art of origami to our relationship with our environment. The various parts of an origami bird — the beak and the wings — are interdependent and proportionate to one another, and any one small change to any of these features affects all others.</p>\n<p>“What I’d like my origami work to show is that, despite all of this interdependence, you can still create remarkable things, even with something as simple as a sheet of paper,” he said. “Imagine what we could create with our physical world if we follow these principles of interdependence.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Srikanth Kalluri is a third-year student, not a second-year. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/","id":2717,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2716,2715,2714],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tax Proposed To Fund I.V.

With approximately 8,377 bedrooms and 215,862 square feet of commercial space in Isla Vista, IVRPD officials estimate the special tax could add $256,348.43 in annual tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, IVRPD will levy the tax for the next 10 years after June 2017. Registered voters will receive mail-in ballots 29 days before May 9, and the measure must attain a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>Property owners currently pay an annual rate of approximately $93 in special taxes. IVRPD runs on a $1.5 million budget.</p>\n<p>Rodney Gould, IVRPD general manager, said the additional special taxes could help pay for more park services, especially since the measure directs at least 50 percent of the tax revenue for capital improvements. He said IVRPD will then be able to address the “backlog of deferred maintenance” in I.V.’s parks.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Board Chair Pegeen Soutar said she hopes the increase in funds could bring reclaimed water into I.V. through a contract with the Goleta West Sanitary District.</p>\n<p>Soutar first proposed the special tax measure in February 2016 in light of two key factors.</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District proposed in April 2015 to proportionally raise water rates by drought level. According to Soutar, this means a $30,000 water bill would increase to $60,000.</p>\n<p>IVRPD officials also foresaw a decrease in tax revenue after the university purchased Tropicana Gardens in July 2015, an Isla Vista residence hall previously owned by a Chicago investor. UCSB is exempt from paying taxes for the property that it owns in I.V. due to state law.</p>\n<p>Despite the decrease in tax revenue, however, the university reached an agreement in which it pays IVRPD the amount lost in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, Isla Vista property owners will be paying the same amount on property taxes as in the 2015-16 fiscal year.</p>\n<p>As of now, property owners pay less on property taxes for the 2016-17 fiscal year because of a land ownership bond that ended in June 2016, paid back like a loan. IVRPD initially levied a property tax to purchase land in I.V., but it effectively paid off the bond in June 2016, and the tax is no longer implemented.</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the special tax is the same amount that property owners were paying to fund the bond. Thus, if the tax measure passes, property owners will see no change in their taxes from the previous fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“They carefully crafted this,” said Joan Hartmann, the chair of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors who consented to the special election. She suggested that because the tax rates are so similar, “this new tax is just a continuation of what people were already paying.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said she originally wanted to put the special tax on the June 2016 ballot, but was unable to get it organized in time. She and other board members then intended to add the measure to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>This plan soon came to a halt last summer, however, after organizers from Yes on E&amp;F — the campaign which sought to establish a Community Services District (CSD) and a utility users tax in Isla Vista — asked the IVRPD board not to add the property tax to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, one of the Yes on E&amp;F organizers, said they didn’t want to have two tax measures on the same ballot. This would have increased the likelihood of both measures failing, he said.</p>\n<p>Paola Dela Cruz, IVRPD board vice chair, said, however, that organizers were being detrimental to the community engagement process in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I thought that our conversations were already hurting relationships and were hurting our future engagement,” Dela Cruz said. “I was seeing, I think, some level of disrespect. I was seeing lack of collaboration.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said Measure F (the utility users tax measure) and the IVRPD special tax could have both passed, but the board ultimately opted to postpone for a later date.</p>\n<p>“IVRPD needs to be able to work with everybody,” she said. “I didn’t want the Park District to be the blame if [Measure] F failed.”</p>\n<p>The IVRPD special tax did not appear on the November ballot. Measure F <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\" target=\"_blank\">did not pass</a> on Election Day.</p>\n<p>Soutar told the Nexus on Tuesday that she foresees no opposition to the special tax, since the tax is no “additional burden” on property owners and since people are “partial to their parks.”</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can tailor this election to what’s strictly positive,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74980\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74980\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/tax-proposed-to-fund-i-v-parks/","id":4661,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4660,4659,4658],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brown: More Funding, Less Aid in the UCs","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tuition-Hike-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tuition-Hike-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gov.

The state would provide a total of $8.4 billion to the UC system in the 2017-18 fiscal year, if the state legislature accepts Brown’s proposal.</p>\n<p>The funding increase reflects a negotiation reached between Brown and Napolitano in May 2015. In the midst of violent student protests, the two agreed to freeze tuition on the contention that the state provide a four percent increase in funding for the next four years. Brown and Napolitano also agreed in May 2015 that the UC would propose a tuition hike no greater than the rate of inflation for the 2017-18 academic year.</p>\n<p>Keeping her end of the bargain, Napolitano proposed last week to raise tuition by 2.5 percent for the 2017-18 academic year, which could be the first tuition hike since 2011. In-state tuition has remained at $11,220 since the 2011-12 academic year, and this proposed hike will increase tuition by $282.</p>\n<p>Anticipating the agreed-upon 2017-18 tuition hike, the UC Regents planned to lay the groundwork for a tuition hike proposal during their November meeting at San Francisco, but the discussion was tabled in the face of student protests.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano held a conference call last Friday with student journalists, during which she addressed the proposed tuition hikes, amongst other matters.</p>\n<p>“In any event, I’m with students that tuition needs to be as low as possible,” Napolitano said in the call. “It also needs to be predictable, and we need to have generous financial aid to help those students from lower-income households. That is what we are striving mightily to do.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74741\" style=\"width: 1017px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74741\" data-attachment-id=\"74741\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/uc-regents-meeting-at-ucsf-mission-bay-by-kenneth-song_for-11-20-2014-8183-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?fit=1007%2C734&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1007,734\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"uc-regents-meeting-at-ucsf-mission-bay-by-kenneth-song_for-11-20-2014-8183\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?fit=250%2C182&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?fit=888%2C647&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74741\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?resize=888%2C647\" alt=\"UCPD officers escort 21-year old UC Berkeley student Jeff Noven through the shattered glass entrance of the UCSF Mission Bay lobby.

An increase in tuition also means an increase in Cal Grants, she said, so low-income students will be able to receive more financial aid.</p>\n<p>Also during the conference call, UC Office of the President (UCOP) spokesperson Dianne Klein said financial aid covers more than just tuition; it covers other “educational expenses” such as housing, transportation and food. She echoed Napolitano in saying the proposed tuition hikes could “provide more resources” to low-income students.</p>\n<p>“It may sound counterintuitive, but the lowest-income students are really going to end up better off because they will receive more financial aid,” Klein said.</p>\n<p>Despite this potential increase in financial aid, Brown’s budget proposal also included a phase-out of the UC Middle Class Scholarship (MCS) program, which provides financial aid to students with family incomes of under $156,000. Students currently receiving such aid would get to keep it in the next academic year, but Brown proposes the UC no longer award the scholarship.</p>\n<p>In a press release Tuesday, Speaker of the Assembly Anthony Rendon dissented to both the proposed tuition hike and the proposal to eliminate the MCS program, which could increase the cost of attending a UC by up to $20,000, he said. Rendon did, however, support increase in UC funds, calling it “good” that higher education receive a “modest funding increase.”</p>\n<p>“We must work to keep college affordable for California students, and I will not support burdening them with higher fees and greater student debt — whether that’s done by raising tuition or phasing out the Middle Class Scholarship,” he said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Regents will discuss tuition hikes at their next meeting on Jan. 25 in San Francisco. Brown will submit a revised budget proposal for the state legislature to vote on in May.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of th</em>e Daily

The CSD has the power to improve infrastructure, institute community policing, mediate between tenants and landlords and run the community center, among other services.</p>\n<p>The failure of Measure F, however, took away the CSD’s ability to levy a utility user tax (UUT) — an 8 percent tax on the utilities of I.V. residents — meant to be the primary source of funding for the local body.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens now?</strong><br>\nYes on E&amp;F organizers have not written off Measure F just yet. There are still 1,349 provisional ballots to be counted Thursday, and proponents are hopeful that these ballots may swing the vote.</p>\n<p>Should Measure F still not pass, however, the future of the CSD could prove to be trivial.</p>\n<p>According to Darcél Elliott, Yes on E&amp;F campaign manager, monthly CSD board meetings could turn into a community space for residents to discuss issues at hand, but “they just wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>“This has been the problem in Isla Vista for a long time. We have the ability to talk about things but not the ability to do anything about it,” she said.</p>\n<p>As for ways to obtain funds, newly elected CSD board member Jay Freeman said it will be difficult to obtain enough money “to pay for anything important.”</p>\n<p>The CSD board of directors could start a crowdfunding campaign, he said, but this is an unlikely option for matching the $512,000 that the UUT could have provided.</p>\n<p>It is also possible that the CSD board could apply for federal grants. The ultimate fate of the CSD, however, hangs on the passage of the UUT.</p>\n<p>According to Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), if voters do not approve the UUT before Jan. 1, 2023, the CSD shall be dissolved as of that date.</p>\n<p>This leads to another issue: deciding when to put the UUT on the ballot again.</p>\n<p>Elliott said CSD board members could very well decide to propose the UUT in the next midterm election in two years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74096\" style=\"width: 6010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1521561605\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74127\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74096\" data-attachment-id=\"74096\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/flashback-election-2012/dsc03790/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=6000%2C4000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"6000,4000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dsc03790\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74096\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>However, running another campaign would prove costly, Freeman said, and organizers are unsure where to obtain funds for subsequent campaigns. He said it would also be difficult to have voters approve a tax that has already been denied.</p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong?</strong><br>\nAccording to Freeman, those active in the CSD movement for the past two years never talked much about the prospect of the CSD passing without the tax. Many proponents took it as given, he said, that the tax and the CSD would both pass.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the Yes on the E&amp;F campaign organizers limited their support by tying their campaign strictly to the campaigns of local Democrats like Congressional candidate Salud Carbajal and Third District County Supervisor candidate Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>“They lost a lot of opportunity to form a coalition of disparate politicians,” he said. He cited how the Yes on E&amp;F campaign rejected the donation of Third District County Supervisor candidate Bruce Porter in August.</p>\n<p>Elliott said Yes on E&amp;F organizers expected the two ballot measures to pass together this election cycle based on general feedback from residents.</p>\n<p>“From everyone we talked to, people were supportive of both of them,” Elliott said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74007\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CSD.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1432194438\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74127\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74007\" data-attachment-id=\"74007\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-09/historic-csd-measure-passes-but-lacks-paired-funding/csd/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CSD.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"csd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CSD.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CSD.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74007 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CSD.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"(Beginning second to left) Jonathan Abboud, Cameron Schunk, Spencer Brandt, Natalie Jordan and Ethan Bertrand pose at the Mill Santa Barbara on election night.

She said they misled voters to believe the tax would significantly increase rent, when, in actuality, the tax would have only been an additional $5 to $10 every month.</p>\n<p>Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes also gained an advantage over Yes on E&amp;F, she said, because they placed flyers on cars throughout Isla Vista. According to Elliott, this is what made Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes an “illegal” campaign.</p>\n<p>“If we left flyers on everyone’s cars, the results might have been different, but we would have been breaking county ordinance,” she said.</p>\n<p>Chuck Eckert, an Isla Vista property owner who led the opposition to Measure F, said the measure didn’t pass simply because it is a “horrible” measure. This is why voters were afraid, he said.</p>\n<p>“What [Elliott] says is probably true, but a lot of times the truth will make people fearful of what will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Fear is the reason Measure F failed, Elliott said, and it has been a driving force throughout this election cycle.</p>\n<p>“In general in this election, fear won over hope,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 10, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/","id":4480,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4479,4478,4477],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Weekly Goings-On in I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Upcoming events include the local State of the Union, an IVRPD board meeting and a Poets’ Club open mic.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>STATE OF THE UNION</strong><br>\nThe next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday at the I.V.

Clinic building. The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, and Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p><strong>PARK IT HERE</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Co-op. The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>OPEN MIC</strong><br>\nThe UCSB Poets’ Club hosts an open mic at 8 p.m. Thursday at Coffee Collaborative. Organizers welcome poets, musicians and comedians.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLAH BACK</strong><br>\nUCSB Challah for Hunger hosts a bread sale from 12-2 p.m. Friday on the I.V. Food Co-op patio. The purpose of the sale is to raise money and awareness for social justice causes.</p>\n<p><strong>MEMORIAL GARDEN</strong><br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting at 2 p.m. Friday for upkeep at the Isla Vista Love &amp; Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014, shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>BUILDING A COMMUNITY</strong><br>\nThere will be another meeting to discuss the future of the Isla Vista Community Center at 1 p.m. Saturday in the I.V. Clinic building. The Isla Vista Community Development Corporation (IVCDC) will be hosting the discussion and providing lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>SOW AND REAP</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Food Co-op is hosting a gardening workshop from 12-2 p.m. Sunday on the Co-op patio. The workshop will be led by Oscar Carmona of Healing Grounds Nursery in Goleta.</p>\n<p><strong>VEGAN</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>CHICKEN FOR KIDS</strong><br>\nEating dinner at Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch (149 N. Fairview Avenue) between 5-9 p.m. on Tuesday will partially benefit the Isla Vista Youth Projects. The organization is currently undergoing a campaign to raise $300,000 before the end of the year so that it may qualify for an additional $300,000 grant from the county. Isla Vista Youth Projects intends to use the $600,000 to buy their building and close phase one of their capital campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>FREE FOOD</strong><br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students. This food giveaway is regularly held every Wednesday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Nov. 10, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74124\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74124\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/","id":4484,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4483,4482,4481],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":6,"route":"/authors/30"}},"__N_SSG":true}
