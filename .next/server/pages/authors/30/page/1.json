The one-way trip took eight hours. <em>Courtesy of Byron Roos-Collins</em></p></div>\n<p>They had been training for months to trek the 13 miles across the channel, but nothing could prepare them for what lay ahead.</p>\n<p>The group launched at 8 a.m. from Channel Islands Beach in Oxnard and soon met several hiccups.</p>\n<p>To begin, the group had not weight-checked their kayaks prior to launching, and, as a result, some members capsized within the first few hours.</p>\n<p>They also discovered that the radios that they had brought were malfunctioning, which left the kayakers unable to call in for help in the event of an emergency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a thick marine layer of fog that April morning made for especially low visibility. Byron Roos-Collins, fourth-year political science major, said the group could hardly see further than a mile ahead of them. Much of their trek across the channel incidentally followed a zigzag course.</p>\n<p>After paddling for several hours, the group of six reached the middle of the channel, a site of high traffic for cargo ships.</p>\n<p>As the kayakers waited for a cargo ship to pass, they spotted a dorsal fin emerge from the water approximately 20 feet away. It was a distinctly triangular fin jutting nearly three feet above the ocean surface, one that the kayakers knew could only belong to a great white shark.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen thousands and thousands of dolphins and whales, and this was neither of those,” Roos-Collins said.</p>\n<p>With the large freighters still passing by around them, the group found themselves unable to paddle away from the shark; they were stuck. The six kayakers had no choice but to stay put and prepare for the worst.</p>\n<p>Anticipating that the shark might mistake the kayaks for seals, the group put their kayaks together to form a larger vessel. Each person had a spear gun or buck knife at the ready.</p>\n<p>Nik Frey, a UCSB alumnus who had recently returned from volunteering as a frontline medic in Mosul, Iraq, began giving the group instructions on how to apply a tourniquet, just in case anyone in the group lost an extremity in a bout with the shark. He also advised that, in the event of a shark attack, the kayakers stab the shark in its “sensitive face” rather than spearing it “willy-nilly.”</p>\n<p>When the freighters passed, the kayakers immediately took the opportunity to make a full charge toward the island. They only made it halfway across the shipping lanes when they spotted the dorsal fin of yet another great white shark.</p>\n<p>“That one was more disheartening I think,” Roos-Collins said.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the shark was uninterested and passed by the group.</p>\n<p>Spirits were low at this point, and the kayakers decided that they would wave down the next boat that passed them in hopes that it would rescue them.</p>\n<p>When a boat finally did pass by, the group waved their hands in the air and blew whistles to get the driver’s attention. Frey said the driver “must have seen” them, but the boat did not stop for them. The group was left “totally abandoned,” Frey said.</p>\n<p>“They gave us no love; they just kept on going,” Roos-Collins said. “It was pretty clear they had seen us.”</p>\n<p>Help was nowhere to be found, and the group knew they had no choice but to finish the trip. Establishing their compass angle again, the kayakers set off to reach Anacapa Island before the close of day.</p>\n<p>After a few hours more paddling through heavy fog, the kayakers were in close enough proximity to the island to see its ghostly shape. It was at this point, Frey said, that the group realized their incorrect compass angle nearly led them to miss the island entirely.</p>\n<p>The kayakers immediately corrected their bearings, pointing the tips of vessels toward the large land mass in the distance. With strong winds at their sides, however, the kayakers had to angle themselves in such a way that the wind would hit the tail of the kayak.</p>\n<p>“Coming to that island was glorious,” Frey said. “Being able to see the island was great. If we couldn’t see the island, then there’s a very likely chance we wouldn’t have made it.”</p>\n<p>The kayakers finally reached the shores of Anacapa Island at 4 p.m., approximately eight hours after first launching from Oxnard.</p>\n<p>Roos-Collins said their arrival greatly surprised the park ranger, who before that point was the only other person on the narrow archipelago composed mostly of jagged volcanic basalt. The primary occupants of the island were thousands of seagulls, highly aggressive during mating season.</p>\n<p>The group set up camp for the night in a site that they had reserved prior to embarking on the trip. They sat atop a high rock formation and enjoyed what Roos-Collins called “one of the most satisfying sunsets” he had ever seen.</p>\n<p>Daniel Connell, fourth-year financial math and statistics major, said the linguini that they ate that night was the highlight of the trip.</p>\n<p>The six kayakers spent the next morning freediving and exploring the island’s various caves until a pre-booked ferry picked them up in the afternoon and took them back to the mainland.</p>\n<p>On their ferry trip back, the six students and alumni shared a beer, reveling in a trip that had turned out to be a success despite many setbacks along the way.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78409\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78409\" data-attachment-id=\"78409\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/channel-surfers-battle-rough-seas-in-13-mile-voyage/kayakers-3-court-of-byron-roos-collins/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?fit=2048%2C1134&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1134\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"kayakers 3 court of Byron Roos-Collins\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?fit=888%2C492&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78409 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins-1024x567.jpg?resize=888%2C492\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?resize=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?resize=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">After spending the next morning freediving and exploring the island’s various caves, the six kayakers enjoyed a beer on their a pre-booked ferry back to the mainland. <em>Courtesy of Byron Roos-Collins</em></p></div>\n<p>Set to graduate in a little over a week, Roos-Collins said no other adventure he embarked on in the past year can top last month’s trek to Anacapa Island.</p>\n<p>For Connell, who will also be graduating soon, the kayak trip ranks “damn near the top” among his overall experiences as a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>“We’re fortunate enough to have ocean views from our homes currently, and waking up in the morning and going out on the deck and actually seeing those islands in the distance is kind of a constant reminder of the journey,” Connell said. “I can kind of look in the distance and see where we encountered some sharks and where we were eating salami.

Yang. The Storke Award is the highest accolade a student can receive at UCSB. <em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I am a real-life example of second opportunities and believing in the potential of kids despite what is happening around them,” she said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz tells people with pride that she is from Compton. She sees a great deal of similarity between Compton and Isla Vista, especially in the negative narratives that have come out of both communities.</p>\n<p>Compton’s reputation of crime and violence had, for a long time, kept her from sharing about her hometown. It was during her time at UCSB, however, that she learned to embrace Compton and to take pride in the “solidarity between black and brown people” there.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz was just a freshman during the Deltopia riots and the Isla Vista shooting of May 23, 2014, which both occurred within a month of each other. The news coverage portrayed I.V. with a lot of “negativity,” she said, and she began to see the same narrative come out of I.V. as with Compton.</p>\n<p>From then on, Dela Cruz set out to make known the positive aspects of Isla Vista: its “wonderful” parks and the children and families that live here alongside college students.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz was elected as an Associated Students (A.S.) senator in 2014 and sworn in days before the shooting. Later that year she won election as a board director with the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD), which was, at the time, the only government agency in I.V.</p>\n<p>Having served a year with IVRPD and A.S. Senate, Dela Cruz sought election as the A.S. external vice president of local affairs (EVPLA).</p>\n<p>As EVPLA, she created the Beloved Community Conference, an annual meeting for Isla Vista residents to voice their experiences and concerns.</p>\n<p>However, her term was characterized largely by her outreach to I.V.’s Latinx families, which she said exist behind a “barrier” beyond the community of college students in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about, ‘These poor families; they need our help.’ It’s not about that. It’s about, ‘How can we work together and help together?’” she said. “Let’s just talk. We’re friends, we’re just ‘gente,’ we’re ‘raza.’ Let’s just get together and talk.”</p>\n<p>The Storke Award recipient is selected by a committee appointed and chaired by Margaret Klawunn, the vice chancellor of student affairs.</p>\n<p>The committee looks for graduating seniors who have demonstrated outstanding scholarship and extraordinary service to the university and its students. Katya Armistead, dean of the Office of Student Life, said the recipient must demonstrate courage, persistence, achievement and a GPA of 3.5 or above.</p>\n<p>“[Dela Cruz] leads with her heart, but she’s also brilliant. That combination, when you see it in someone, it’s pretty rare,” Professor Rick Benjamin, one of several faculty and staff to nominate Dela Cruz for the Storke Award, said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“[Dela Cruz] leads with her heart, but she’s also brilliant. That combination, when you see it in someone, it’s pretty rare.” -Professor Rick Benjamin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pegeen Soutar, the chair of the IVRPD board, said that Dela Cruz demonstrates a wonderful understanding of Isla Vista and that long-term residents adore her.</p>\n<p>“I think she just has an outstanding commitment to this community,” Soutar said. “The woman is smart, she’s compassionate, she really listens.”</p>\n<p>Rachel Arriaga, an analyst in the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and another staff member to nominate Dela Cruz, said Dela Cruz blossomed at UCSB and became a leader in the community.</p>\n<p>“She’s leaving UCSB a better place,” Arriaga said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz is graduating with a 3.7 GPA, and she is completing her thesis on the history of the Ventura School for Girls, a California state institution established in 1913 for delinquent girls.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she heard that she won the Storke Award after receiving a call from Chancellor Henry T. Yang around midnight over a week ago.

that Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors, wrote “The Crystal Ship” one night in Isla Vista during the 1960s when he was dropping acid on the beach and looking out at the bright, glimmering Platform Holly just off the coast.</p>\n<p>Now it appears the crystal ship will soon be sailing away.</p>\n<p>Venoco, Inc., the Denver-based oil company which owned Platform Holly, relinquished the oil platform and the rest of its holdings in the South Ellwood Oil Field to the state just before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April.</p>\n<p>The oil platform has been inactive since the 2015 Refugio oil spill, when a Plains All American Pipeline ruptured and spilled 142,000 gallons of oil along the Gaviota Coast.</p>\n<p>The pipeline that burst, Line 901, fed oil to and from Platform Holly.</p>\n<p>The closure of Line 901 for the next two years decimated Venoco’s operations in the South Ellwood Oil Field and substantially curbed the company’s financial strength.</p>\n<p>The California State Lands Commission (SLC) now owns Platform Holly and announced in April that it will begin decommissioning the oil platform as soon as possible, a process that it said will be “expensive,” “complex” and “lengthy.”</p>\n<p>The SLC said it would soon begin the process of contracting a project manager to oversee the decommissioning process. The state agency estimates it will take approximately three years to fully decommission and remove Holly, but this estimate is “heavily dependent” on the availability of funding and equipment and the length of time it takes to identify the environmental impacts of removing the oil platform.</p>\n<p>Bob Evans, a local ocean photographer, spoke out to KEYT last week in opposition to a complete removal of Platform Holly, insisting that doing so would harm the marine life dwelling around the columns below.</p>\n<p>“I spent a lifetime taking underwater pictures in the California Channel Islands and I have never seen the amount of life that exists on these platforms, and it would be a travesty to remove these structures,” Evans told KEYT. “I am wondering who’s going to give the eviction notice to all the little creatures that live on Platform Holly?”</p>\n<p>Evans suggests the state remove only the top portion of the platform to keep the lower part as a marine sanctuary, KEYT reported.</p>\n<p>Still, decommissioning Holly comes as a major victory for local environmental efforts.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77893\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1524158438\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77960\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77893\" data-attachment-id=\"77893\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/farewell-holly/img_9920/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9920\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77893\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77893\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“We have waited for this day for a long time,” Fran Farina of the local Sierra Club chapter said in a statement released the same day Venoco filed for bankruptcy.<br>\nARCO first constructed Platform Holly in 1966, and the oil rig reached peak production in 1984.</p>\n<p>Farina said that the Sierra Club has been combating offshore drilling in the area since the 1980s, when ARCO was looking build additional oil platforms near Holly.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Environmental Defense Center said in April that local environmental groups were “celebrating” the announcement of Platform Holly’s removal, explaining that Holly and other oil infrastructure in the area “pose a threat to public health and the environment.”</p>\n<p>Upon the removal of Platform Holly, there will be 26 offshore oil platforms remaining off the California coast between Orange County and Santa Barbara County, The Mercury News reported.</p>\n<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama implemented in November a temporary moratorium on all new offshore oil drilling off the California coast until 2022.</p>\n<p>Several California lawmakers applauded the decision but called on Obama to institute a permanent ban in light of Donald Trump’s promises to expand offshore oil drilling.</p>\n<p>Although President Trump has not made any tangible steps toward lifting Obama’s ban, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said in March that opening federal waters for oil drilling is “a pillar of President Trump’s plan to make the United States energy independent.”</p>\n<p>Frustrated local environmental groups protested over 100-strong when Secretary Zinke visited Santa Barbara in April.

Senate voted against the divestment resolution, 0-16. Seven abstained. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Many Jewish students who spoke at the public comment portion called the resolution anti-Semitic, saying that divestment from the nation state of Israel personally affects Jewish students on campus.</p>\n<p>Nate Erez, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, said the resolution presents an anti-Semitic rhetoric and is a “denial of the Jewish right to self-determination.”</p>\n<p>“This language is no more than a clever disguise to achieve a much more sinister agenda,” Erez said during public forum. “This is a direct attack on the one Jewish state in the world.”</p>\n<p>Danielle Cohen, fourth-year sociology and film double major, said the BDS and SJP movements have presented a “misleading portrayal” of the Israel-Palestine conflict and have normalized anti-Semitism on the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>“I have never felt so unsafe and unwelcome on campus than I do during the BDS campaign,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Other students reject the argument that divestment from Israel is an attack on religious or ethnic Jews.They defend the resolution saying that divestment maintains the UC’s neutrality in the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“All this resolution is doing is fueling division on our campus.”</p>\n<p>— Aaron Hendizadeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>Menelik Dagnachew, a third-year English major, said he supports divestment as an Ethiopian American because he believes the oppression of Palestinians is similar to the oppression of Ethiopian people.</p>\n<p>“My heart bleeds for Palestinian people,” he said. “It makes me mad so that I’m shaking right now. As much as this is a cultural issue … this is not an issue we should be directly tied to.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Klein, a second-year history major and Jewish student, spoke in favor of the resolution and objected to the alleged victimization of the Jewish ethnic minority.</p>\n<p>“Just because you’re a minority does not give you the right to violate human rights,” he said.</p>\n<p>Michael Torbati, the chief financial officer of the A.S. Finance and Business Committee, said he is opposed to divestment because he believes the investment in the companies is beneficial for students and the university.</p>\n<p>“In terms of fiscal responsibility, these investments bring a lot back to UCSB students,” Torbati said.</p>\n<p>Other speakers at public forum in support of the resolution cited historical events, such as the United States Civil Rights movement and the South African apartheid, as similar to the violation of human rights of the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p>Steven Kwok, the A.S. director of legislative accountability, urged the senate to vote through a roll call vote “in the interest of transparency.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The public forum ended at approximately 2 a.m. and the Senate then heard statements from the resolution’s sponsors, Kaur and Tessema. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During deliberation, some senators echoed the opinions of students who spoke earlier saying the resolution was an anti-Semitic gesture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Aaron Hendizadeh said that if this resolution was solely about divestment from U.S. companies, then the drafters would not have needed to include the companies’ partnerships with Israel in the resolution text. He said he believes the resolution singles out Israel for this reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All this resolution is doing is fueling division on our campus,” he said.</span></p>\n<p>Senator Hannah Ellenhorn said the resolution ignores the cultural and religious identities of Jewish students on campus and marginalizes the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“Only a minority of a community can define what hatred is against that community,” she said. “You cannot tell the Jewish community that this is not an attack on their identity.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other senators defended the resolution, insisting as students did earlier in the night that divestment from Israel is about asserting the UC’s neutrality in the Israel-Palestine conflict.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Jonathan Lopez said the resolution does not question whether or not the state of Israel has a right to exist; rather, he said it is about withdrawing UC investments from alleged human rights violations in the Middle East.</span></p>\n<p>“We cannot be complicit in these acts anymore,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, who served as a proxy for Senator Lesly Silva, said he is in solidarity with the Palestinian people as a member of Queer Commission and said he understands the feeling of being oppressed in society.</span></p>\n<div class=\"infogram-embed\" data-id=\"senator_divestment_votes\" data-type=\"interactive\" data-title=\"Senator Divestment Votes\"></div>\n<p><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement(\"script\");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\",\"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");</script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0;

Posters and overnight bags cover the walls and floors of Cheadle Hall’s first-floor lobby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 150 students protested Monday and almost 40 students stayed overnight, Fossil Free UCSB spokesperson Cassie Macy said. Organizers report that over 200 students have joined Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang reportedly met with student leaders at approximately 3 a.m. Tuesday morning to arrange  a meeting later that day. Fossil Free UCSB coordinators Theo LeQuesne and Claire Wilson started their meeting with Yang at approximately 3 p.m. Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UCSB says the chancellor already “embraces the campaign,” according to a press release Monday, but organizers hope that Tuesday’s meeting will spur Yang to take a more active role.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that, with his public acknowledgement of support for our campaign, that will have a rolling effect with other chancellors across the UC campuses so that they will also step up and commit to divesting away from fossil fuels,” Celeste Argueta, a Fossil Free UCSB spokesperson, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil fuel activists at UC Berkeley staged a similar sit-in just two weeks ago, during which over 20 students sat in Sproul Hall for almost 10 hours until UCPD asked them to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Davis chapter of Fossil Free UC also hosted a sit-in last week on their campus. Student activists initially planned to demonstrate in Mrak Hall during business hours but opted instead to stay the night after being asked by administration to vacate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the most successful sit-ins have divested from fossil fuels, so why can’t we?” Macy said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UCSB organizers plan to remain in Cheadle Hall until Thursday.

Its purpose was to serve as an alternative to what Schunk called “over-policing.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Public Safety Commission (ASPSC) later took charge of UCIV, and the program only operated during Deltopia and Halloween in the years to follow. When Minoiefar entered the office, he intended to work alongside ASPSC to make the program a weekly operation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Expansion of the program had a “slower start,” he said, because ASPSC relied mostly on their hired staff. They later found more success when they were able to “build more of a volunteer pool.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he assisted ASPSC in marketing for volunteers, suggesting to the UCIV organizers that they open the opportunity for different student groups to “sponsor a weekend.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One student group that did this recently, Minoiefar said, was Campus Democrats, which provided “a bunch of volunteers” for the weekend they sponsored.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[UCIV] is headed in the right direction, and I’m really happy to know that it’s going to stay here after I leave,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another goal for Minoiefar was to implement a policy of medical amnesty, which would protect UCSB students from legal charges if they are hospitalized while committing unlawful activities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar had been working with A.S. President Austin Hechler for over a year to regulate medical amnesty. Hechler said they came up with the idea after the university held a fraternity chapter liable for an unconscious partygoer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said the problem exists outside this specific incident as well, saying students in residence halls and other groups, like sports teams, are often afraid to call 911 during parties.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Medical amnesty is state law, but it is not currently part of university policy. Minoiefar and Hechler have, for the past year, been drafting a new campus regulation called “the responsible action protocol.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said the draft passed a UCSB Campus Regulation committee “at the very beginning of this quarter,” and it now awaits approval by Chancellor Henry T. Yang and UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar will soon be meeting with officials from UCSB Judicial Affairs to discuss implementation of the responsible action protocol, which he said is “really, really important.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’ve seen it work with student groups a lot … Students know that they can call [911] and be safe,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar also set out this year to decrease police presence at Deltopia, I.V.’s annual Spring Break celebration along Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Both UCPD and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) sent fewer police officers to Isla Vista this Deltopia, anticipating smaller crowds than in years prior. UCPD deployed approximately 70 officers for Deltopia this year, down from approximately 100 in 2016. SBSO did not want to disclose the number of officers it assigned.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Attendance increased to approximately 8,000 people this year, up from approximately 3,500 in 2016. Police made 42 different arrests this year, which is slightly more than last year but significantly lower than the number of arrests made the previous year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There were a total of 14 medical transports this year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think Deltopia was a good enough of an event,” Minoiefar said. “I really wish that the [number of] medical transports could have been a lot lower. That, for me, is a benchmark of a successful day: making sure people are safe.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said several factors played into the decreased police presence at Deltopia this year. For one, he said police have “caught on” to public perceptions of having law enforcement at the event. He said having Spring Insight on the same weekend also helped.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[Deltopia] being on Spring Insight kinda helped because the school wanted a good image there and was obviously concerned with how parents see this campus,” he said. “I wish we would have gotten on that train a little faster.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he sees Deltopia 2016 as a “measuring point” for what police presence during Deltopia could look like in future years.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would argue that I think it was a manageable day,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he came into the EVPLA “pretty aware of what it’s like,” having for years prior been involved in I.V.’s political scene.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I guess one thing that kind of surprised me was the degree of the kind of power that student leadership has,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The EVPLA really can establish himself as a mobilizer of student interests and a representative of student interests,” he said. “They are really heeded and looked to for a lot of answers, which was very … enlightening.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In his year serving in the position, Minoiefar said he has grown to be more of a delegator in his leadership style, whereas he said he used to be “kind of a micromanager.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kristen Armellini, Minoiefar’s deputy chief of staff, said she has also saw this growth in Minoiefar, especially when it came to sending representatives to meetings on his behalf.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I was going to meetings for him, and he really wanted to make sure I knew the position through and through,” she said. “He would let me go to meetings for him [and] would make sure we were educated on everything.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Madison Hechler, the EVPLA chief of staff, said Minoiefar teaching her was “an opportunity for him to share his passion for Isla Vista” and not a “chore.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar plans to receive his degree in history of public policy in June. He will be starting an internship with the San Francisco District Attorney’s office, which he said is along the line of work that he hopes to go into.</p>\n<p>“I’ve really taken interest in law,” he said. “Public safety has always been a big part of what I do. I’ve always been keen on public service, and being a district attorney seems like a very engaging experience.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77395\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77395\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/","id":3956,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3955,3954,3953],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: A.S.

Elections Board claimed soon after election night in April that the Interfraternity Council (IFC) gave “monetary incentives” to its members who voted, alleging the organization believed votes could be “bought and sold.” The board called for a revote of the entire spring ballot.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77392\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77392\" data-attachment-id=\"77392\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/as-austin-candidate-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=1400%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1400,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS-austin-Candidate-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=171%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=700%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77392\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9-700x1024.jpg?resize=600%2C878\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"878\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=700%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=171%2C250&amp;ssl=1 171w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=768%2C1123&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;ssl=1 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Former A.S. president Jimmy Villarreal, alongside the UCSB Audit and Advisory Department, launched an investigation into the claims but determined in late May that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on behalf of IFC.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler believes he might be the “shortest-term president” in A.S. history.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think we got a lot done, though,” he said in an interview on Monday. “I’m proud of it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler ran on four platform items last spring: launch an alternative transportation program for disabled students, reform campus sexual assault policy, push for the establishment of the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) and make course readers more affordable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After several months, the alternative transportation program has become what is now Gaucho Rides, a pilot program that offers disabled students free rides to and from campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler, along with former senator Jerel Constantino, proposed the program approximately two years ago when he served in A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In April 2016, the two senators reached out to Lyft, a rideshare app that allows users to hail a taxi on demand, and were able to secure a partnership with the company. A month later, A.S. Senate passed a resolution to allocate $40,000 to the alternative transportation program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Applications opened for the first time in September to enroll 20 disabled students for free Lyft rides between home and campus. Hechler’s office named the program “Gaucho Rides.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The pilot program shut down in the third week of Winter Quarter, and the <i>Nexus</i> is currently verifying the causal factors. Meanwhile, Hechler said his office is developing a “backup plan” in which students can receive rides without the use of codes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Office of the A.S. President will most likely re-launch Gaucho Rides later this week, Hechler said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> in September that, depending on how the program ran in the next two quarters, he and other advocates would consider pushing for a lock-in fee for it. This week’s A.S. Elections ballot does not include such a measure.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s next platform item — sexual assault reform — has resurfaced intermittently throughout his political career.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The issue arose in April 2015 during an A.S. candidate forum when Hechler was running for a seat on A.S. Senate. An anonymous audience member asked the candidates how they plan to address campus sexual assault, and Hechler answered in response that he intended to extend sexual assault prevention training to the Greek community.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like the Greek community is such a strong and compassionate group that will rally around anything,” he said in 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler incorporated the same policy into his platform when running for president last year, calling it “one of the bigger parts of [his] platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said on Monday that this year, he spearheaded a campaign to have fraternities and sororities learn how to prevent sexual assault through the Green Dot Bystander Intervention Program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The program was funded by Hechler’s office and solicited approximately 120 men and women from IFC and the Collegiate Panhellenic Council (CPC).</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alejandra Melgoza, who vied against Hechler in 2016, said she is yet to see Hechler involved in any of the monthly conversations with university administration concerning sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also said Hechler has not yet released a statement about Sexual Assault Awareness Month or attended any events hosted by Take Back the Night, a student group dedicated to preventing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As President, he was also unable to keep his own senators who ran on a platform of sexual assault accountable,” Melgoza said in an email. “Sexual assault is not an issue that can be put on a platform to earn political capital. It affects many students personally, including myself.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said he has often sent representatives from his office to various meetings addressing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also promised in April 2016 to lead the push in A.S. for a CSD in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He and Ashcon Minoiefar, the A.S. external vice president of local affairs, worked closely together to gather volunteers for Yes on E&amp;F, a campaign which sought to establish the CSD through Measure E and fund the CSD with a special tax through Measure F.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As it turns out, voters in November overwhelmingly approved Measure E, thus creating the CSD, but did not pass Measure F, taking away the CSD’s main funding source.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fourth and final part of Hechler’s presidential campaign platform was to provide to students the least expensive course reader materials through a partnership with A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It was, like, a long process because at first we didn’t how to do it,” he said on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s office began work on this plan early on, sending out emails en masse to every professor at the university. The emails asked that faculty primarily use A.S. Publications instead of Alternative Digital Printing, the private printing business in the UCen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">His office later opted to contact academic department heads instead. He said some departments, such as the political science and environmental studies departments, responded positively. Others did not reply at all, he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The goal at the end of the day was to create a bank through Pubs where, I guess, professors could upload their things and students wouldn’t even have to buy it. It would just be on the internet; you know, environmentally friendly,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said David Miller, the A.S. Publications staff member who died in March, told him that his office more than doubled the amount of course readers published through A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The plan to increase student use of A.S. Publications “died out,” Hechler said, after Miller passed away.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also took up a few other projects outside of his platform items, including an initiative to expand the A.S. Food Bank and a push to give priority registration to ROTC students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Breanna Jones, the A.S. Food Bank committee chair, told the <i>Nexus</i> in early April that Hechler advocated strongly to university administration for the expansion of the A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[He] really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened,” she said in April.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Senate passed a bill earlier this month to give priority registration to ROTC students, and the resolution now awaits approval from the Academic Senate. Senator Alex Giolito, who introduced the bill alongside senator Riley Hobson, said two weeks ago that Hechler “brought this all together by reaching out to ROTC students first.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This year I’ve really tried to hold the senators accountable in ways that I never thought I would have to,” Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Melgoza said she found Hechler’s platform items to be “inherently hollow” and “lacked substance,” saying he had “no personal connection to anything on his platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She added that she never viewed Hechler as “someone with conviction” when they both served on A.S. Senate, and she said her views have not changed since.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There were other senators who I definitely disagreed with at the table but I still admired their dedication to their beliefs,” Melgoza said in an email. “Hechler on the other hand was constantly passive.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Arielle Kronovet, Hechler’s chief of staff, said Hechler’s kindness can often be mistaken for passivity and that he is actually “firm to his beliefs.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“He’s serious about leaving this school a better place, and I’ve seen him doing this throughout the year,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Talia Stringfellow, the A.S. president’s deputy chief of staff, said she found Hechler to be more decisive and communicative than his predecessor Villarreal, whom she worked for as an A.S. fellow the year before.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sometimes [Villarreal] changed his mind and was not a big communicator,” she said. “Communication has been a huge, sweet [and] influential part of why I think Austin’s such a good president.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler will finish his term in the next few weeks, handing the presidency to whomever students elect Thursday night. In the meantime, Hechler said, he is applying for jobs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s funny because I bet everyone thinks, ‘Oh you have a nice title; you’re going to find a job easily.’ It’s not that easy. It’s really not,” he said. “Honestly I had no idea you had to apply to jobs so early.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler looks to receive his degree in political science in June. Wherever he ends up in the next few years, he said, he wants to continue in public service.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I really just want to give back to communities,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been so privileged to have so many great opportunities in my life, and I want to give that back to people wherever I am.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/","id":3953,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3952,3951,3950],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Arrest Two in Suspicion of I.V.

Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Andy Doerr, manager of the A.S. Media Center, moderated the forum. He posed six questions, formed by the A.S. Elections Board, and gave the candidates one minute each to answer. Doerr also relayed questions asked anonymously by audience members.</p>\n<p>Here are the highlights of Monday’s IVP candidate forum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When asked about the largest problem with A.S., Sandhu cited what she called the “inability” of new senators to become comfortable and accustomed to their new position. Silva, meanwhile, said A.S. should “step up on accountability by making the association more public” and increase transparency with the work on-campus senators participate in.</li>\n<li>Both candidates listed passion as an important quality to have as an IVP. “Those with passion can dedicate themselves to the job can do it well effectively and efficiently,” Sandhu said.</li>\n<li>When asked how they would preserve a civil environment in Senate, Silva said she would make the senators “feel validated” for their work. Sandhu said she would “empower” senators to serve their constituents.</li>\n<li>When asked how they would train new senators, Sandhu said she would “revamp” senator training in the summer and focus on building strong connections with Boards and Commissions. Silva said she wants outgoing senators to train incoming senators through “informative workshops.”</li>\n<li>In terms of the connections that each candidate had for both student leaders and administrators around campus, Silva cited her working relationships with administrative officials like Assistant Director for Government Affairs LaDonte King, Executive Director Marisela Marquez and her history with student groups like the Black Student Union. Sandhu emphasized on the importance of maintaining these relationships and said she was “fortunate to have connected with different students on campus.”</li>\n<li>An audience member asked the candidates how familiar they are with the internal workings of an organization. Sandhu said she was the class president through fifth grade and high school and served as a senator this year. Silva said she has been “privileged” to have mentors within the association and understands the different perspectives of members of the association through their work on the budget.</li>\n<li>In her closing remarks, Silva said she is grateful for the opportunity to run for office and for those who have supported her. Sandhu said she loves UCSB and wants all students to have a positive experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S.

Media Center, moderated the forum. He posed 12 questions, created prior to the debate by the A.S. Elections Board, and gave the candidates one minute each to answer. Doerr also relayed questions asked anonymously by audience members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the rest of the highlights from Monday’s presidential debate:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>COMMUNITY</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Asked to define “community,” Nemeh gave a simple answer: “Isla Vista.” Nemeh said the university, police and Santa Barbara County have not prioritized student needs in their decisions concerning Isla Vista, which he said he hopes to address as president. Le said community is “being a Gaucho,” and he added that he plans to increase career planning services and expand the alumni recruitment network.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>POLICE PRESENCE:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates if they felt police presence made the campus safer, to which Nemeh responded, “No.” Nemeh said the campus needs to “reevaluate our relationship with police,” citing an incident in February where a female skateboarder was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forcibly detained</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Arbor after she attempted to flee from receiving a ticket. Nemeh advocated instead for  what he called “community-based policing.” Le said Nemeh “highlighted the cons” of campus police presence, but he wanted to “highlight the pros.” He said the police departments have made progress in “demilitarizing” their officers, and he cited the “substantial decrease” in the number of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrests at Deltopia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this year.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>QUALIFICATIONS</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Nemeh said the attribute that uniquely qualifies him for president is his “pre-existing understanding” of A.S., having worked with the student government for the past three years. Le said his qualifying attribute is his “leadership capabilities,” and as president he said he wants to implement a “bottom-up” approach. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When asked how he has been an advocate for marginalized communities, Le cited his lobbying experience. He said he wants to empower students of marginalized communities rather than the “top-down” approach of advocating for them In response to the same question, Nemeh cited his work toward implementing the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/a-s-senators-explain-new-voting-system-for-spring-senate-elections/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single Transferrable Vote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which he said makes voting more “equitable” in A.S.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>STUDENT FEES: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first audience question of the day asked the candidates what they will do to ensure fiscal responsibility in light of the fact that UCSB students pay the highest student fees in the UC. Le said he plans to start a program for students to run their own businesses, which he said will create an alternate revenue source for A.S. Nemeh said A.S. needs to prioritize on eliminating tuition rather than reducing student fees.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>CAMPUS + LOCAL:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates if they view the position of A.S. president only working on campus issues. Nemeh said the Isla Vista Party wants to work directly with the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) and alongside the student governments of other UC campuses. Le said the president needs to help be present in statewide affairs and in making sure that President Donald Trump does not “encroach on our campus.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The next audience question asked the candidates if they had ever worked with UCSB Undocumented Student Services. Nemeh said he has “not directly” worked with the program, but he hopes to pick a qualified undocumented students services coordinator to work in the Office of the A.S. President. Le cited his experience lobbying to make California a “sanctuary state” and working alongside state legislators to push such legislation.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>CAMPUS CLIMATE:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another audience question asked the candidate to give their thoughts on campus climate in regard to a recent visit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ben-shapiro-packs-campbell-hall-for-controversial-lecture/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Shapiro</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a cancelled visit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-11/milo-yiannopoulos-visit-canceled-at-uc-santa-barbara/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milo Yiannopoulos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Le said he supports freedom of speech “so long that these speakers abide by university conduct and they do not incite harm.” Le also mentioned how he was once a registered Republican in high school and has since switched party affiliations. Nemeh said he does not tolerate “students coming out and attacking other students for their identities,” citing the violence that erupted from Yiannopoulos’s visit to Berkeley in February. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>LEADERSHIP:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked what is the most important quality of a leader, Le said a leader must be able to listen to the issues of students on campus. Doerr did not pose the same question to Nemeh.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>SPECIAL PROJECTS:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doerr asked each candidate if they planned to undertake any special projects should either of them become president. Nemeh mentioned again the “$48 fix,” but he also said he wants to implement an open-source textbook library. Le cited again his work to eliminate student tuition through the state legislature.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>LEGACY:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked about the legacy they would want to leave, Le answered that it is not about leaving a legacy but rather about setting up a foundation for future student leaders. “Coming in with the mindset that we have to do everything in one year is not practical and feasible,” he said. Nemeh said he would like to strengthen communication between A.S. and university administration so that everyone is not “trying to reinvent the wheel from the beginning.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>ANTI-SEMITISM:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The last audience question of the day asked the candidates how they plan to address the anti-Semitism on campus that may result from the Israel-Palestine conflict. Le said the campus needs to facilitate “ a civil discourse between Muslim groups on campus and the Jewish organizations.” Nemeh disagreed with Le, saying the Israel-Palestine conflict is not a Muslim-Jewish conflict. “Students who have disagreements with each other on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have it because of political disagreements, not religious ones,” he said.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>FREEDOM OF SPEECH:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates to give their stance on the abilities and rights of students to protest. Both candidates said it is a constitutionally protected right.
