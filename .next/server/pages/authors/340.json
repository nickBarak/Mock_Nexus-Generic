While some residents worry about a growing epidemic, other local organizers and prosecutors are committing themselves to decreasing gang violence in Santa Barbara and its surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>Gang Facts</p>\n<p>\tAccording to District Attorney Hilary Dozer, the southern region of Santa Barbara County is home to about five to seven major gangs and 1,200 gang members. He also said that while many gang members in the area are of Latino descent, the county also has its few white supremacist and black gangs. He also said that an all-female gang exists and is known as the Nightowls.<br>\n\t“We do have women that affiliate with gangs, but in terms of committing crimes, they’re less likely to do that,” Dozer said. “But I have been in court with some women [who committed crimes] that I would not want to be on the receiving end of.”<br>\n\tThe two largest gangs in the area are the Eastside Gangsters and Westside Destroyers that claim separate divisions of the city. Dozer said Goleta is mostly claimed by the G-13 (Goleta-13) and it has many subsets called groupings.<br>\n\tHe said, generally, the gangs get along except when they “slip” into each other’s territories.<br>\n\t“Gangs between Eastside and Westside Goleta are relatively even, but it could change six months from now,” Dozer said.<br>\n\tDan McSkimming, a senior deputy for the County Sheriff’s Dept. Gang Unit, said that other incidents occur when one gang feels injured or insulted by another.<br>\n\t“It’s almost always gang versus gang, or if not, someone’s in the wrong place at the wrong time, or it’s an associate that crosses them,” McSkimming said.<br>\n\tDozer said that while most gang violence is gang on gang, civilians can also get injured. The G-13 grouping called the Lakotes claim Isla Vista and are responsible for some of the gang violence near the university.<br>\n\t“Students need to be aware that crime takes place everywhere,” Dozer said. “Including the ivory towers of UCSB.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Crime and Punishment</p>\n<p>\tDozer said that three prosecutors, himself included, focus on gang crime.<br>\n\t“The D.A. targets gang crime with the highest prosecution,” Dozer said.<br>\n\tHe said gang-related crimes receive harsher punishments as the result of the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act. The S.T.E.P. Act was developed in the late 1980s in an attempt to deal with the tremendous amount of inter-gang war in Los Angeles County. Dozer said that in 1992, L.A. County had about 1,000 gang-related murders. S.T.E.P. made it criminal and prosecutable to be in a gang for a person who knows the gang is committing crimes.<br>\n\tDozer said that while he believes gang violence is at a high right now, it will lessen with the help of community members who report crime.<br>\n\t“In my 15 years of experience, gang activity ebbs and flows until it gets to a high point, which I think is now, but it goes away,” Dozer said.<br>\n\tMatt Sanchez, leader for the after-school youth program All For One, said he is a former gang member and that while most people think gang violence is an escalating problem, in Santa Barbara it is actually a small part of reported crime, with many of the offenders being minors.<br>\n\t“I call it youth violence because gang violence makes people think the public is in harm’s way, but it’s not against civilians, it’s gang on gang,” he said.<br>\n\tSanchez also said he first joined a gang when he was 16 and eventually became a leader of a gang called the Hoods. He said a lot of his family was also involved in gangs.<br>\n\t“It cost my brother his life and after that, hopelessness made me push the envelope. What was the point of going on?” Sanchez said.<br>\n\tHe said he served time for armed robbery, drugs, firearms and three times for attempted murder, though, he said, none of these crimes were gang-related. He said the only thing that made him stop was the fear that his children would follow in his footsteps.<br>\n\t“I saw my kids growing up and starting to emulate me, and I said no,” Sanchez said.</p>\n<p>Young Gangsters<br>\n\tThe average age of gang members is between 14 and 15, and it is not unusual for kids to start associating with gangs in elementary school, Dozer said.<br>\n\t“When you’re young, you’re put to work or do things for other gang members,” Dozer said. “But it’s not surprising to find gang members in their 20s. Longtime members are called veteranos.”<br>\n\tMcSkimming said the gang unit tries to influence kids in grammar school the most, since they are the most likely to join and are actually the most violent.<br>\n\t“The younger ones are often the most violent because they are trying to make a name for themselves,” McSkimming said. “The older ones are the shot callers, and the younger ones are doing violence to make names for themselves.”<br>\n\tVincent Castro, a first-year Santa Barbara City College student, said a great deal of his extended family was involved in gangs. He said he had trouble in his immediate family and was 10 when he first became involved with a gang.<br>\n\t“The gang was really my family because my family was not there,” Castro said. “I was 10 years old when a gang member got me high for the first time.”<br>\n\tHe said he was 14 when he started committing crimes for the gang and about 16 when he first met Matt Sanchez at All For One, formerly Hoods in the Woods. He said the workshops with Sanchez helped him the most.</p>\n<p>Juvi<br>\n\tYoung detainees charged with intense gang-related offenses are sent to the Santa Barbara Juvenile Hall. Facility Manager Karen Wheeler said the juvenile hall has 19 detainees filling the 20 single bedrooms available. She said while many detainees associate with gangs, only a few are actually in juvenile hall due to gang-related crime.<br>\n\t“Approximately 20 percent or less of the total number of minors on probation … are there for crimes that are gang related,” Wheeler said. “And a percentage of those in custody that claim a gang are higher than 20 percent.”<br>\n\tShe said the typical day in the life of a detainee involves going to school at the juvenile facility that teaches traditional high school subjects, participating in supervised physical education, having supervised showers and attending programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Wheeler said S.T.E.P. applies to juveniles as well.<br>\n\t“We have a zero-gang-tolerance policy,” Wheeler said. “The penalties are court approved, and the detainees know if they’re engaged [in gang activity] there’s a penalty.”</p>\n<p>A Solution</p>\n<p>\tFormer gang members Matt Sanchez and Vincent Castro are working together at the program All For One to keep kids out of gangs and out of juvenile hall. Co-created by Sanchez in 1992, All For One has about 50 members that meet every week, discuss their problems and participate in activities.<br>\n\t“We try to teach them responsibility. … We help them with their homework, find a school; we look for their gift, their special talent, and capitalize on that through education or working,” Sanchez said.<br>\n\tThe group consists of mainly high school-aged boys. Castro said he joined the group when he was 16 and now is the project coordinator. He said he thinks more programs like All For One would reduce gang numbers and that Sanchez helped him quit.<br>\n\t“When I went to juvi, I was just thinking, ‘Oh man, I let Matt down,'” Castro said. “He really motivated me to do right.”<br>\n\tCastro said he mentors a lot of the boys, going to the neighborhoods to recruit and educate. He said there is some hostility between kids from different parts of town when they first join the group, but the main rule in the program is to have respect for everyone, so they get over it fast. Castro said even he had a beef with a student at SBCC because he was from the other side of town, but they made amends when Castro became a leader for All For One.<br>\n\t“I told him, ‘We helped start it, homes, why can’t we stop it?'” Castro said.<br>\n\tSanchez said he has high hopes for the club and cares most about making the club sustainable so future generations can benefit from its programs.<br>\n\t“It’s easier to swim down current, but it takes somebody with real courage to swim against the current,” Sanchez said. “Sometimes it’s harder to do the right thing.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/","id":3563,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[3562,3561,3560],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"You’re Paying for the View","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With a beautiful view of the ocean, sunny weather and a campus within walking distance, it is no surprise that thousands of UCSB students crowd into Isla Vista each year like clowns into a circus car....","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a beautiful view of the ocean, sunny weather and a campus within walking distance, it is no surprise that thousands of UCSB students crowd into Isla Vista each year like clowns into a circus car. However, these luxuries do come at a price – literally. Although the national housing market continues to plummet, housing in Isla Vista continues to become costly, with the average monthly rate for a two-bedroom apartment having risen over $200 from 2006-07 to 2007-08. As students begin their housing quests this month, many are gradually becoming aware of this trend.</p>\n<p>Sky High Prices in Flight</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Community Housing Office Manager Roane Akchurin, the January rush for housing started earlier and heavier than normal this year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It is based on supply and demand, and the January craze is those bigger apartments,” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>In I.V., the monthly rental average for a two-bedroom unit based on 214 listings was $2,263 for 2007-08. However, in 2006-07, the monthly rental average for a two-bedroom unit was $2,022 based on 146 listings – an average jump of $241.</p>\n<p>St. George and Associates Manager Terri Bailey said the high demand for I.V. housing keeps the rent rising. She said her company owns all its properties – although some are partnerships – and that it tries to remodel often and add amenities to its available housing to make the costs more appealing.</p>\n<p>However, Isla Vista Tenants Union Chairman Gerson Sorto said that, while he approves of increased housing quality, he still believes many I.V. apartments are overpriced. Sorto, a fourth-year political science major, also said these price rises were difficult to curb.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult when landlords have so much power,” Sorto said. “They have to adhere to certain standards, but they’re not that strict.”</p>\n<p>With regards to UCSB, Sorto said he would like to see the university put pressure on landlords to keep prices lower. He said the high rents discourage low-income students from attending UCSB.</p>\n<p>Yet, UCSB Housing and Residential Services Executive Director Wilfred Brown said private renting is just that: private.</p>\n<p>“It’s not like the university can go in there and tell the landlords what to price their property,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Meridian Group Management Co. President Robert Kooyman said his company manages about 220 units in I.V. for a large variety of private owners, so it is not always the managers in charge of price raises.</p>\n<p>“People think the managing company makes all the rules, but a lot of it is the owners,” Kooyman said.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, the university is not entirely dissolved from I.V. It owns properties such as I.V. Theater and Embarcadero Hall and will lease land to the new Isla Vista Foot Patrol Office on 6504 Trigo Road. The university is also funding half of the I.V. Master Plan, which will pay for remodeled storefronts, multi-story buildings and bike loops, as well as renovated sidewalks and parks.</p>\n<p>Still, some areas in I.V. continue to have higher prices than others. In particular, Bailey said some rents are often influenced by the ocean-facing – and party-loving – Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t take a rate increase on everything,” Bailey said. “One person sets prices on DP, and that affects everyone else’s price level.”</p>\n<p>DP Dollars</p>\n<p>DP’s oceanfront location and party hard reputation has, hands down, made it the most popular street to live on in I.V. Many students also consider living on the “Party Street” as a rite of passage at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“DP is the most sought after street,” Bailey said. “It really sets the tone for all of I.V.”</p>\n<p>Kooyman said his company manages a few properties on DP and that such units often carry with them incredibly large liability issues. He said many of his company’s tenants break their leases mid-year. Common complaints include loud music and parking problems.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, James Gelb is a private landlord of many I.V. properties, including 14 on DP Gelb said DP generally costs about 10 percent higher than the rest of I.V. in return for the ocean view. He said he sets his prices based on the number of people trying to rent from him.</p>\n<p>“The price raise is dictated on supply and demand,” Gelb said.</p>\n<p>Gelb, like many I.V. landlords or managers, is a UCSB alum himself and said he enjoys renting to students because they are good tenants and are timely on their payments. He said the key to continuing business is maintaining good property management, good service and good prices.</p>\n<p>An Inconvenient Number</p>\n<p>Due to the high demand for I.V. housing, though, “good pricing” has become a very gray area. Akchurin said she was amazed at how high the rent prices have gone up and said the only way for students to make an impact on the cost is to not live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“At some point you have to ask, who’s setting the game?” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>While the average rent rate is going up for the whole of I.V., there are a few extreme cases of rates rising by four digits. Bret Smith, a second-year mechanical engineering major, said he and his current housemates will not renew their lease on Abrego with St. George because their rent will be too high.</p>\n<p>“We want to live closer to DP plus they’re raising the rent by $1,000, so that would make it impossible to live here,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Smith said St. George sent him a letter explaining that his two-bedroom doubles would become triples next school year, making the rent go up by $1,000.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how they expect six people to live here with one bathroom,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Akchurin said because leases are one-year only, landlords can legally raise the rent to however much they want.</p>\n<p>“Because they’re new contracts, there’s not a barrier on that,” Akchurin said. “It’s whatever the market will bear, unfortunately.”</p>\n<p>Beth Goodman, a second-year political science major, lives in a one-bedroom apartment in the same building. She said she also received a letter from St. George, but that her apartment’s rent would increase from  $1,400 per month to $1,800 per month.</p>\n<p>“They said they want four people in the singles, and we have two people now,” Goodman said. “For the one bedroom, that’s ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>St. George declined to comment on that particular rent raise.</p>\n<p>San Clemente the Savior?</p>\n<p>Despite, the raising prices, Akchurin said I.V. landlords may see some new competition with the opening of UCSB’s San Clemente Village located along El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>“Word on the street is that they’re afraid of the impacts of San Clemente,” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>The two-bedroom and four-bedroom apartments will house 964 graduate and transfer students, each with their own single bedroom. Rent at San Clemente will cost $723 per person for the four single-bedroom apartment or $831 per person for the two single-bedroom apartment. The price includes utilities, cable and Internet.</p>\n<p>However, Kooyman said he is actually glad San Clemente will open because it will offer students affordable housing.</p>\n<p>“When the university builds housing, it helps students,” Kooyman said. “The university doesn’t pay property tax, and that’s high. You cut that out, and you save 30 percent. All things we struggle to get, they have set up state of the art.”</p>\n<p>Kooyman said the only things he does not like about San Clemente is that it was built on top of Storke Field. He said he would rather see I.V. infill than spread out, so as to maintain the surrounding greenery and views.</p>\n<p>Gelb said he is not worried about the structure affecting his business and even looks forward to the competition.</p>\n<p>“We thrive on competition, it’s the American way of doing business,” Gelb said. “I’m not afraid of it, and I encourage it.”</p>\n<p> Brown said the school plans on building more structures like San Clemente in the future, with housing development plans in the works on Ocean Road as well as 90 units of housing planned for the north knoll of the recently purchased Devereux land.</p>\n<p>Go Go Goleta</p>\n<p>According to a CHO survey, in Fall 2007, 6,175 undergraduate students lived in UCSB residences, 2,008 lived in Goleta, 8,660 lived in I.V. and 1,884 lived in Santa Barbara. In Goleta, a two-bedroom apartment is about $1,550, nearly $1000 less than a two-bedroom in I.V.</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole other market that’s missing from students’ minds in Goleta,” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>Most contracts in Goleta are month-to-month versus the twelve month lease in I.V. Students who want to live in Goleta have many more options available to them in June, instead of signing up in January for a lease that starts in June.</p>\n<p>“We’ve created this nightmare market in I.V. where people sign contracts in January for June,” Akchurin said.</p>\n<p>Sorto said another problem with living in I.V. is the community does not have a collective memory.</p>\n<p>“There is a significant percentage I consider to be long term residents like low-income families and professors, but the mass majority of the population leaves in like five years, and that really affects I.V.,” he said.</p>\n<p>As for the future, Gelb said the community must collaborate in order to keep I.V. more stable.</p>\n<p>“Students and landlords should work in cooperation with each other,” Gelb said. “We’re both on the same side. We want good housing.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15631\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15631\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-30/youre-paying-for-the-view/","id":3558,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[3557,3556,3555],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Billion Dollar Building Plan","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB is currently in the middle of a $1 billion capital program to construct new buildings and revamp infrastructure.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB is currently in the middle of a $1 billion capital program to construct new buildings and revamp infrastructure.

The LRDP also defines how a campus will accommodate students and staff without excessively damaging coastal resources.</p>\n<p>Fisher said the LDRP plan includes new academic buildings, additional faculty and staff, more student housing, new recreational space, higher quality public space and restoration of natural habitats, as well as modernized walkways, roads and bike paths.</p>\n<p>“For example, we are proposing adding 5,000 beds of student housing and approximately 1,800 units of faculty and staff housing,” Fisher said.</p>\n<p>UCSB representatives will present the campus’ LDRP to the University of California Board of Regents for certification this coming spring before it is submitted to the California Coastal Commission for approval. The CCC focuses on protecting California’s coastal environment and regulating the use of land and water in the coastal zone. Development and construction activities usually require a coastal permit from the CCC before staff can break ground. The CCC is particular about building plans and often requires groups to revise their proposals.</p>\n<p>“The process of review with the California Coastal Commission should be six to 12 months,” Fisher said. “The first buildings proposed in the plan could begin construction after approvals from the Coastal Commission.”</p>\n<p>The university’s plan, also known as UCSB Vision 2025, centers on university development for the next 20 years. During the last several months, Fisher said UCSB has presented its LRDP to the community at various meetings.</p>\n<p>“The public reaction has been very favorable,” Fisher said. “The plan proposes a sustainable and forward thinking live-work model that the community is very interested in.”</p>\n<p>Multi-Million Dollar Baby</p>\n<p>The consulting and approval process by planners, deans, committees, the chancellor and the Board of Regents takes years, though the most challenging part about building and renovating UCSB facilities is the cost, despite the high revenue the university attains, Fisher said.</p>\n<p>“The most difficult issue facing campus construction has been the escalation of cost over the past four years,” Fisher said. “This escalation has impacted our ability to move projects forward as quickly as we would like.”</p>\n<p>Levy said building construction and maintenance is usually paid with mandated student fees, donations or bonds. Academic buildings are paid for through state approved funds and from private donations.</p>\n<p>One structure funded largely by donations is the Carsey-Wolf Center for Film, Television and New Media, which is currently under development. The project received huge monetary gifts from such celebrities as “Law &amp; Order” series creator Dick Wolf, UCSB alumnus and Oscar-winner Michael Douglas and “Cosby Show” producer Marcy Carsey.</p>\n<p>Levy said the most expensive project under construction right now is the San Clemente student housing facility on El Colegio Road. The project has an estimated final cost of $143 million, making it the most expensive facility UCSB has ever built. Another project, concerning renovations and additions to the Davidson Library, will serve as the second most expensive building venture. The estimated $60 million library project will begin within the next two years.</p>\n<p>Lean, Green Building Machine</p>\n<p>As UCSB continues to expand campus facilities, it is also including energy efficient renovations to its list of projects. It is one of three universities in the nation participating in the pilot stage of the new energy efficient rating system created by the U.S. Green Building Council. The Leadership for in Energy and Environmental Design certification program includes awards for eco-friendly projects in two categories: new construction and building renovations. A LEED certified building must conserve water and energy, and reduce waste and greenhouse gas emissions, among other qualifications.</p>\n<p>According the U.S. Green Building Council’s Web site, “LEED certification provides independent, third-party verification that a building project meets the highest green building and performance measures. All certified projects receive a LEED plaque, which is the nationally recognized symbol demonstrating that a building is environmentally responsible, profitable and a healthy place to live and work.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said UCSB’s Bren Hall is the first LEED certified green building in the UC system. Bren Hall received a platinum level LEED, the highest certification possible, and is the greenest laboratory building in the United States. He said it does not take longer to construct green buildings, nor does it cost much more.</p>\n<p>“The Campus has made a commitment to achieve LEED certification through the U.S. Green Building Council at the Silver Level for all new campus buildings,” Fisher said. “In addition we are working to certify a group of 25 existing buildings in the LEED for Existing Buildings program as part of our commitment to improve existing buildings.”</p>\n<p>The Destiny of Devereux</p>\n<p>In addition to its green efforts, the university has also increased its size. UCSB recently purchased the remaining 33-acres of the Devereux Foundation land on Sept. 28, 2007. Fisher said the land will be developed but the Devereux School, a facility that provides residence and rehabilitation services for people with developmental disabilities or neurological disorders, will remain in its current location on the north knoll of the Devereux site as a long-term tenant to the university.</p>\n<p>“A preliminary plan shows 90 units of housing on the north knoll and 200,000 gross square feet of academic space on the south knoll,” Fisher said. “The area north of Devereux includes approximately 50 units of housing, expansion space for childcare and additional campus recreation fields.”</p>\n<p>The Devereux Slough, which is located on the Coal Oil Point Natural Reserve next to the newly purchased site, will not, however, see development. The Associated Students Coastal Fund recently allocated a $4,000 grant to the Devereux Slough Monitoring Program to create a database for animal and plant life as well as monitoring environmental conditions of the slough.</p>\n<p>Levy said despite UCSB’s need to expand, preserving some natural environments is vital to the university.</p>\n<p>“It is important to research programs and from a biological point of view,” Levy said. “It is also important to the ecology of the state of California.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Dreamin’</p>\n<p>The university is also taking part in developing Isla Vista. Levy said besides owning buildings in I.V., like I.V. Theater and Embarcadero Hall, the campus also enhances the community with other projects like leasing the land at no cost for the new Isla Vista Foot Patrol building, which will relocate from Pardall Road to 6504 Trigo Rd. The school is also intensely involved in the Isla Vista Master Plan.</p>\n<p>“[The] Campus funded half of the Master Plan for I.V. so obviously we’re invested in I.V.” Levy said.</p>\n<p>The 736-page long IVMP has been in the making since 2000, and will modernize I.V. by changing zoning codes, beautifying the downtown area and renovating parks and roadways throughout I.V.</p>\n<p>Fisher said the new university housing buildings will help to relieve the impacted student residence halls and help to preserve the diverse community of students and families.</p>\n<p>“I believe that the campus would prefer I.V. to develop as a diverse community,” Fisher said. “This diversity would include students, faculty and staff, as well as off-campus residents.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-12-03/billion-dollar-building-plan/","id":3557,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[3556,3555,3554],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mine Shafts Below UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Long before professors and administrators dined on Thai chicken in the Faculty Club or drama majors performed in Hatlen Theater, the land these facilities now stand on was once home to Goleta's very o...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Long before professors and administrators dined on Thai chicken in the Faculty Club or drama majors performed in Hatlen Theater, the land these facilities now stand on was once home to Goleta’s very own asphalt mines. For nearly a decade in the late 19th century, the land now occupied by UCSB hosted packs of miners picking and blasting at the rich asphalt deposit that runs along the Goleta coastline. The asphalt mined here was then used to pave streets and seal roofs in Goleta and other regions around the country.</p>\n<p>A Brief History of UCSB</p>\n<p>The beautifully landscaped campus students now call UCSB has passed through many hands over the centuries. The Chumash tribe originally lived on the land, and according to documentation from the Santa Barbara Museum Historical Society, even had permanent settlements near Cheadle Hall and the 217 entrance to UCSB. Later, under Mexican rule, portions of California lands, including Goleta, became available for purchase by private buyers. In the 1890s, a group of Englishmen started the Alcatraz Asphaltum Company and took over the land after it became windswept. The now filled-in mine shafts lie between the University Art Museum and the Faculty Club on campus. At the turn of the century, the mine was abandoned and the land went through several owners until 1942 when World War II led to the creation of a military base in the area. In 1950, the University of California Board of Regents purchased the base and in 1954 opened a liberal arts school known as the UC Santa Barbara College, a name that was later shortened to UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Getting the Shaft</p>\n<p>The Alcatraz Asphaltum Mine operated from 1890 to1898 on the site of the present day UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>Senior Campus Planner Dennis Whelan said a fenced area blocks the filled-in entrance to the main vertical shaft.</p>\n<p>“They are generally located in the area between the Faculty Club, Hatlen Theater and the Arts Building,” Whelan said. “A fenced area is clearly visible from the service road between the Faculty Club and Hatlen Theater, now heavily overgrown with ivy. The horizontal shafts ran in several directions laterally around this vertical shaft.”</p>\n<p>The Alcatraz Asphaltum Company leased the 400-acre tract of land from then-owner Mr. August Den. The mine employed 50 men ranging from local boys to experienced gold miners to quarrelsome transients. In one document from the Santa Barbara Museum Historical Society, historian Horace Sexton described the working conditions as long and arduous.</p>\n<p>“The men worked shifts of 10 hours each, two shifts making up the day’s work,” Sexton wrote. “The change-overs were at 7:00 a.m. and at 4:30 p.m. They came up for an hour at noon looking like blackened gnomes.”</p>\n<p>The mine paid $2.50 per day to the miners and $2 to the “muckers” who hauled dirt and shale out of the mine and loaded the asphalt onto cars sent to the main shaft. The miners and managers lived in bunkhouses and ate in a cook house on the site.</p>\n<p>When the mine first opened, no one managing had much experience, so the first shaft sunk crookedly some 200 ft. into the viscous asphalt itself, about 50 ft. from the lagoon.</p>\n<p>According to California Dept. of Conservation records, the deposit of asphalt was one of the purest examined, with the asphaltum being three to 12 ft. thick in some places. The walls were formed of slightly solidified clays, with distinct stratification.</p>\n<p>The asphalt would expand and harden when exposed to the air in the shaft, so it was decided a second shaft should stand in the shale alongside the vein of asphaltum as opposed into the vein itself. However, this second shaft was later deemed dangerous due to brackish water that kept seeping in and creating the potential for flooding in the shaft and skin infections.</p>\n<p>In his writings, Sexton stated that the mine was quite deep.</p>\n<p>“The horizontal tunnels, called ‘drifts,’ extended some 100 ft. to the ore body,” Sexton wrote. “These drifts were made every 50 vertical ft. to the final depth of the mine, some 550 ft.”</p>\n<p>The miners worked their way through the shafts by picking and blasting with dynamite. Besides the obvious blasting and seepage dangers, the mine was dangerous in other ways as well. Continuous streams of warm gas flowed from the asphaltum, and two men were even killed when their candles exploded in a pocket of gas. Their deaths established safety rules that had previously not existed. Cave-ins also occurred, injuring miners, and in one instance, impaling a worker on his own pick.</p>\n<p>At the height of production, the mine produced 60 tons of asphaltum daily. The product was transported all over the United States, and according to Sexton, it was “reliably reported that the streets of New Orleans were paved with asphaltum from the Goleta mine during those years.”</p>\n<p>The Alcatraz Asphaltum Company was later taken over by other companies and refined until 1898 when oil was deemed cheaper to produce and the Goleta mine was abandoned.</p>\n<p>Ross Brunetti, an engineer and geologist for the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, said many tar and asphalt mines existed in California until people discovered they could obtain oil from wells for much cheaper.</p>\n<p>“In 1901, the first major oil field opened and within a few years of that asphalt mining couldn’t pay out,” Brunetti said. “The whole state was so rich with oil from wells that mining asphalt was not economical until the energy crisis of the 1970s.”</p>\n<p>He said when the asphalt and tar mining industry collapsed, the workers oftentimes inadequately filled in the mines or simply left them open.</p>\n<p>“There was no requirement or incentive back then,” Brunetti said. “They’d just brush off their hands and walk away.”</p>\n<p>Mine for the Taking</p>\n<p>Today, students biking to class may have no knowledge of the sand-filled shafts that could rest below them, as the exact location of each filled-in shaft is indefinite.</p>\n<p>“Nobody knows precisely where they are,” Brunetti said.</p>\n<p>Whelan said a historic marker once stood before the ivy-covered square hedge near the Faculty Club. He also said the sign may have disappeared as the result of theft.</p>\n<p>“There was a historic site marker at the location,” Whelan said. “It is not there now.”</p>\n<p>While the asphalt mines on UCSB campus are filled, Brunetti said the state has many unmarked abandoned mines. When one is found, the Office of Mine Reclamation is informed and proceeds to fill it in for safety.</p>\n<p>“If it’s a vertical shaft, they will fill it in,” Brunetti said. “If it’s horizontal, they will put a grill over the entrance so bats can go in and out. This way it can remain a habitat.”</p>\n<p>Abandoned Mines Unit geologist Sarah Reeves said many factors affect the safety of abandoned mines. She said that if a mine were backfilled with sand and gravel versus clay, the mines are less stable.</p>\n<p>“It really depends on how extensive the underground workings are,” Reeves said. “The fill material can sometimes actually erode further into the mine and sink.”</p>\n<p>Though the Alcatraz Mines were probably filled with sand and dirt, Reeves said they are not likely to be dangerous because of the lack of evidence concerning sinkholes or moving foundations.</p>\n<p>“If you build something on an abandoned mine thinking it is safe because it is filled and pressure from the building makes the horizontal shafts move, the building can move, and that would be bad,” Reeves said. “It’s really a case by case basis.”</p>\n<p>Whelan said he is not worried about campus building foundations. He said UCSB takes mine shafts into consideration before constructing new buildings.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14963\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14963\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/","id":2185,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[2184,2183,2182],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hot Fuzz, Cold Beers and Open Containers","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The anticipation is palpable in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office as more and more officers file into the room.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The anticipation is palpable in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office as more and more officers file into the room. Friday, Aug. 24 marks the weekend before Santa Barbara City College starts its fall session. In response, the police force charged with keeping order in the square mile that has become infamous for its parties has upped its numbers to 16 officers on foot and several “rover” units in squad cars.</p>\n<p>At 10 p.m. the deputies and officers leave the station and break into several large groups consisting of about five men each and head toward the infamous Del Playa Drive. All conversation halts and eye contact is avoided as students pass by the officers. Partiers on the decks of houses above can be heard muttering, “Uh oh, there’s the police, what time is it?” in a bid to avoid a ticket for violating Santa Barbara County’s midnight noise curfew.</p>\n<p>Ninety percent of all crime in I.V. is alcohol-related. Fear, however, is not necessary according to IVFP deputy Isaiah Tchobanoff. He said if you just follow the rules you can have both a social life and a clean record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Ignorance is no excuse,” Tchobanoff said. “You have responsibility as students to know the laws.”</p>\n<p><b>All of It?</b></p>\n<p>Three young men walk down the 6500 block of DP carrying two cases of beer while drinking some. They see the cops and begin speed walking, but to no avail. Tchobanoff instructs them to sit down on the curb while he begins to gather their information. One of the men does not have an ID so he tells Tchobanoff his details.</p>\n<p>At the scene, Sergeant Daniel Massey explains the consequences of these actions as he watches one sullen young man on the curb with his Coors beer.</p>\n<p>“If what he says is true then he’ll be given a ticket and sent on his way – after pouring out all the beer,” Massey said.</p>\n<p>Two of the young men are issued infractions for open containers. If the men were under 21, they would have received a minor in possession citation, which is a misdemeanor. An MIP penalty is more serious than an infraction and results in a mandatory court appearance where the judge can pick from a plethora of punishments to bestow upon the lawbreaker. These men, however, are of legal age and so they are given their tickets and instructed to pour out all of the beer.</p>\n<p>While the two are still soaking the ground with suds, another young man walks onto the street talking on his cell phone with a beer in the other hand. In a matter of seconds he is plopped down next to our current offenders crying, “Wait, I was just in there. I came out to talk on my cell phone!”</p>\n<p>Too late. Officers can issue open container citations in places with public access like the street, the sidewalk and even some driveways. The infraction carries a $108 fine.</p>\n<p>All these gentlemen could have easily avoided the tickets if they had just waited to enjoy that Rocky Mountain taste indoors.</p>\n<p><b>Dude, Where’s My Gas Cap?</b></p>\n<p>Near the end of the 6500 block of DP, officers catch a young man tampering with an Isuzu parked along the street. The man has removed the gas cap and placed it on the top of the car. An officer takes the man’s driver license and begins reviewing the information when both officers suddenly take off running to break up a potential fight down the block. The vehicular hooligan cries out to his friends standing in the shadows across the street, “Should I run? He has my ID! Should I run?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!” cheer his friends but just as the young man leans forward to run, the officers return, none too happy upon observing his attempt of flight. The owner of the Isuzu is retrieved from the house behind, briefed of the situation and asked if he would like to press charges. The irate Isuzu driver enthusiastically proclaims, “I am so sick of people messing with my car. Yeah, I wanna press charges!”</p>\n<p>The offender begins to babble that he was just pulling a prank and that all sorts of people have screwed with his car in the past. The officers explain that it is no excuse for messing with a stranger’s vehicle and that they have no idea if the removal of the gas cap was all the young man would have done. The young man is charged with vehicle tampering, which is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine, imprisonment or both. The young man is placed in handcuffs and walked to a police car.</p>\n<p><b>The White Rubber Gloves</b></p>\n<p>Around 1:30 a.m., a large group of IVFP deputies and officers are standing in front of the 6500 DP beach access when a young man stumbles to the top of the stairs from the salty scented darkness below. The man is extremely intoxicated and appears suspicious. The officers now have probable cause to search him.</p>\n<p>This quickly leads to a classic “spread ’em” situation against a police car. Two officers put on white rubber gloves. One officer searches the man and hands whatever he finds to the other. The sea-loving drunkard has a round, silver flask full of dark alcohol. The liquor is poured out and the man is handcuffed and taken to the county jail for public intoxication. Once the man has sobered up, police will release him and he may receive some additional fines.</p>\n<p>Generally, courts will mandate that first-time offenders under 21 enroll in the Youth Offender Program. Penalties can include fines, the suspension of one’s driver license for one year and mandatory alcohol classes. In addition, UCSB may send a letter home to one’s parents detailing the violation.</p>\n<p>As far as I.V. weekends go, this particular night is actually uneventful. Police gave 25 citations and made two arrests, most of which were for open containers. Carrying an open container down DP is like playing Russian roulette and the safest way to win is not to play. The mistakes made by these rabble-rousers are easily avoided if you party as smart as you party hard.</p>\n<p>Sidebar:<br>\nGeneral Guidelines for Citation-Free Partying<br>\n1. Always carry your cups upside-down to show you have no booze and the IVFP will have no reason to stop you.<br>\n2. After midnight on weekends and ten on weekdays, music cannot be audible from 100 feet over a property line or you can get a noise infraction that comes with a $108 fine.<br>\n3. Walk your bike to avoid a BUI. That’s biking under the influence and although it may seem fun at the time, if convicted, you’ll have to go to court and possibly pay a fine of $1,300 and have your driver license suspended for a year.<br>\n4. Don’t carry an open container!<br>\n5. If you’re under 21, even carrying a closed container of alcohol for someone else can get you a citation.<br>\n6. Holding hands with 12 other people will not save you from getting in trouble if you’re intoxicated.<br>\n7. Don’t lie or mouth off to the IVFP.<br>\n8. Don’t attract attention to yourself by running, yelling or picking a fight.<br>\n9. Don’t take off your shoes or sit down on the curb. It’s usually a sign that you’re intensely intoxicated and an officer will probably approach you.<br>\n10.
