However, the two-time defending champion came short to No. 1 USC in a nerve-wrecking game that came down to the last six seconds of the match ending 8-7 in favor of the Trojans.</p>\n<p>In the opening game on Friday, Stanford came out ready to dominate the competition, nearly shutting out the Gauchos in the first half.</p>\n<p>The first goal came at the 5:19 mark, which initiated a 3-0 run in the first quarter for the Cardinals. The second period started off the same way, with Stanford controlling the tempo of the match allowing it to score another six goals before the end of the first half.</p>\n<p>Midway through the second quarter, UCSB drew the first exclusion of the game. The Gauchos capitalized on the play and junior utility Miranda Schrader found junior attacker Brenna Thomas on the left wing to put Santa Barbara on the board for the first time.</p>\n<p>However, Stanford’s stout defense restricted UCSB to the lone goal, maintaining its eight-point lead going at halftime by a score of 9-1.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game was more favorable for the Gauchos as they seemed more settled and showed glimpses of what got them to the first-round matchup.</p>\n<p>“I think we came down a little bit from the excitement of being here. We found our rhythm and matched their tempo,” Head Coach Serela Kay said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense held off the Cardinals in the third quarter, limiting them to only two goals, both of which came toward the end of the period. Then senior utility Samantha Murphy initiated an offensive breakthrough for the Gauchos, in which they outscored the Cardinals 4-3 in the second half.</p>\n<p>Murphy went 2-3 in the game. Her second goal came in the fourth where she faked out the defense by looking one way and sending the shot to the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The other two goals came courtesy of Schrader with a shot from the right side and junior attacker Jenna Solberg, who got the last goal after she stole it and went for the point herself with only six seconds left on the clock. Solberg picked up a team-high of two steals, while senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had one along with six saves.</p>\n<p>“We are excited to be playing here at the NCAA Tournament for the first time,” Kay said. “And we know that today was part of the process in getting experience with the bright lights and everything that comes with playing in the ‘Big Dance,’”</p>\n<p>UCSB faced No. 10 UC San Diego the following day in the consolation bracket. Senior attacker Bryn Hudson led the team with two goals and two assists, but it was not enough to take down the Tritons in a 10-5 loss.</p>\n<p>It was Hudson who opened up the scoring for both teams at the 6:47 mark in the first quarter. From the right wing, she shot to the far post where it was impossible for UCSD’s keeper to reach.</p>\n<p>The Tritons answered immediately, scoring their first goal 38 seconds later on a power play. This was the first of six goals that UCSD would make as a result of its 6-on-5 advantages out of the seven they registered.</p>\n<p>After four consecutive plays in which the Tritons scored, the Gauchos were able to break the 4-0 run in the second quarter with a steal from Schrader right in front of the cage. The Gauchos counter-attacked, and a pass from Brokaw to Hudson left the attacker in a one-on-one match against the goalkeeper, completing the play and trimming the score to 4-2.</p>\n<p>Yet again, however, the Tritons reacted with another goal of their own to gain a 5-2 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior center Lauren Martin picked up a goal early in the third period after drawing one of her team-high three ejections in the match to make the score 5-3. Despite an early fourth quarter goal by junior utility Taylor Shore and a last-minute goal by Solberg, the Tritons had managed to score three more before the end of the third period ended and two more in the fourth to secure their victory.</p>\n<p>In the final game of the weekend, UCSB faced the No. 13 San Diego State Aztecs for seventh place, in which the Gauchos finished their 3-0 season sweep of the Aztecs with an 8-2 win.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the nerves that came with being in the Big Dance seemed to finally disappear for the Gauchos in the final match of their season. The defense shut out the Aztecs in three of the four quarters with the help of Brokaw who collected 10 saves and a steal.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the team worked together to tally eight goals in total, six of them coming in the second half. Martin, Shore and junior defender Sophie Trabucco all recorded a pair of goals.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos did not win the tournament, it was a great learning experience for the younger ones who hope to make an appearance again next year and an unforgettable memory for those that are graduating.</p>\n<p>In one season, they broke several records and completed what no other team in program history had accomplished. A major puzzle piece to that success is the Gauchos’ squad of graduating seniors in First Team All-Big West selections Brokaw, Murphy and Martin. Martin was also named to the Second Team All-Tournament.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, next season looks to be just as promising as the Gauchos will welcome back returning players like Thomas, Shore, Schrader, Solberg, Trabucco and the talent from freshmen Ashley Riley and Sarah Kreiser.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71051\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/seventh-place-finish-for-ucsb-in-first-ncaa-tourney-appearance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71051\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/seventh-place-finish-for-ucsb-in-first-ncaa-tourney-appearance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/seventh-place-finish-for-ucsb-in-first-ncaa-tourney-appearance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/seventh-place-finish-for-ucsb-in-first-ncaa-tourney-appearance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/seventh-place-finish-for-ucsb-in-first-ncaa-tourney-appearance/","id":5477,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5476,5475,5474],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take on Reigning Champion in No. 2 Stanford","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After winning its first ever Big West Conference title, the No. 7 UCSB women's water polo team will attempt to pull off one of the biggest upsets in NCAA water polo history against reigning champion N...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This year’s Big West Tournament was an unforgettable moment for the No. 7 UCSB women’s water polo team.

The Gauchos are set to face the No. 2 Stanford Cardinals in the first round as announced in the NCAA Selection Show the following Monday after Santa Barbara’s title victory.</p>\n<p>The Cardinals, who ended their regular season with a 21-5 overall record, were the runners up this year in the MPSF Tournament. Stanford lost to the top-ranked team in the nation, USC, after a dominating fourth quarter by the Trojans in which they put away five goals, making it difficult for the Cardinals to come back.</p>\n<p>After the decision was announced as to who UCSB would face, it was time to go right back to the drawing board and begin preparing for this weekend.</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and Stanford faced each other earlier this season in March, ending with the Cardinals prevailing with a crushing 16-5 victory over the Gauchos. While UCSB will enter Friday as the underdog against a powerhouse in Stanford, the Gauchos have shown resilience week after week, having endured just two losses since their loss to Stanford.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the greatest advantage that the Cardinals possess is their postseason experience. But the Gauchos remain determined to keep things afloat with their performance in the pool.</p>\n<p>“Nothing changes for us,” Kay explained. “We will be great competitor’s with the same mindset we had at Big West Championships. [We will continue to] focus on being present and pay attention to the little things.”</p>\n<p>Since the commencement of the NCAA Women’s Water Polo Championship back in 2001, Stanford is the only program to make an appearance every single year. This year, the Cardinals are on the hunt for their fifth national title in the past six seasons and what could be the sixth in program history. Stanford currently reigns as the national champions for the past two consecutive years.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara on the other hand has never been to the “Big Dance” before, but will be guided by the past playing experience of Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>As a four-season starter at UCLA, Coach Kay won three national championships from 1996-2000.</p>\n<p>“This is the same water polo game we have played all season, now we are all just dressed up like prom,” Kay said. “It is important to remember water polo is not rocket science – put the yellow ball in the back of their net and keep it out of ours.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that with Coach Kay in charge of the team anything can be accomplished. In only two short years at UCSB she has helped UCSB claim the Big West Tournament title for the first time ever and also became the first coach in program history to be named Big West Coach of the Year. Most notably, Kay is the first coach not from UC Irvine or Hawai’i to receive the honors.</p>\n<p>To add on to the list of records, this year five Gauchos were named to the All Big-West team, three of them to the First team.</p>\n<p>UCSB had just four other honorees over a span of seven years. The three players that received the First team accolades are the Gauchos’ group of seniors in center Lauren Martin, utility Samantha Murphy and goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw. Senior attacker Bryn Hudson managed to move up from her honorable mention honor last season to Second team this year, and junior utility Taylor Shore received honorable mention for the first time.</p>\n<p>Helping guide Santa Barbara to its conference title victory was the outstanding play of Murphy, who was also named the tournament’s MVP after recording three hat tricks in three-straight matches and a record nine goals. She also finished second on the team with 72 points, 40 goals, 32 assists, and 36 steals.</p>\n<p>Not all her accomplishments are in the pool though. The San Jose native was recently named the 2015 Big West Scholar-Athlete of the Year.</p>\n<p>Another strong force in the paint for UCSB is a two time Big West Player of the Week recipient in Martin,who finished her senior season strong after coming off the bench. She led the team in scoring with a team-high of 49 goals and an impressive .505 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Complementing the Gauchos’ potent offense was their stout defense as well. Fortunately for the Gauchos,  they had Brokaw defending the cage. The fourth-year goalie registered 267 saves this season, 60 more than the second best finish on the team, averaging 8.9 per game.  Going into this weekend, she is only 10 short from moving up one spot to third on the All-Gaucho list.</p>\n<p>“I expect us to continue to ride the wave we are on – with a championship mindset, having each others back, and competing in every minute and every second of the game no matter what,” said Coach Kay on the team’s expectations this weekend.</p>\n<p>The NCAA Tournament will take place at the UCLA Spieker Aquatics Center beginning Friday, May 13 through Sunday, May 15. UCSB is set to face Stanford at 1:45 p.m.</p>\n<p>The winner of Friday’s match will advance to a Saturday semifinal against the victor of the tournament’s first game between UCLA and either UC San Diego or Whittier. Those two will meet in one play-in, while the other will pit San Diego State against Wagner.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 12, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/","id":4997,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4996,4995,4994],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Risky Plunge Rewarded","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Committed to enhancing her performance in the pool, Lauren Martin’s intentional redshirt decision has resulted in a career year for the center thus far.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>From the moment that a student-athlete enrolls full time in school, their five-year window of athletic eligibility begins to roll.

Others may choose to take advantage of that extra year to work on their skills so that they may gain more playing time in their sport for the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Yet neither of these reasons apply to senior center Lauren Martin of the UCSB women’s water polo team.</p>\n<p>The Clovis West High School graduate joined the Gaucho family after a very successful high school career in which she earned seven varsity letters both in water polo as well as swimming. She is a two-time All-American, collecting First Team honors as a senior and Fourth Team accolades as a junior.</p>\n<p>Martin was also an All-CIF Central Section selection twice and earned All-Tri River Athletic Conference distinction two times as well. Martin led her team to three consecutive Tri River Athletic Conference titles and individually won consecutive CIF championships in 2008 and 2009.</p>\n<p>It was no surprise that after all of those merits, the freshman went on to play in all 35 games in her first season, generating 29 goals and 13 assists and finishing the season with an impressive shooting percentage of .392. Martin also led the team in earned penalties and ejections with a high count of 47 that year. The two following years were as productive as the first, contributing 24 and 33 goals her sophomore and junior season, respectively.</p>\n<p>Playing time was not a problem for Lauren who had certainly earned her spot as the team’s center player; however, coming into her fourth season she decided to take a year off.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I redshirted last year is because I had certain goals for myself and I felt that I would meet those goals if I took off a year and just trained,” Martin said. “We had a new coach and I wanted to try and figure out her coaching style and also because our team was very young.”</p>\n<p>Train she did, and it certainly paid off. Although players continue to assist practice and play against their own teammates, not participating in games against outside competitors can deteriorate some athletes’ skills.</p>\n<p>Yet, this was not the case when it came to Martin.</p>\n<p>Right from the start of this season, her presence made such a significant impact on the team. In her first game back against Cal, she put away four goals alone, proving that she had been waiting to be back in the pool with her teammates for a very long time and seemed determined to make the most of her senior campaign.</p>\n<p>“She’s been sitting for over a year waiting to play,” Head Coach Serela Kay mentioned in an interview earlier this year. “She’s excited, and we’re excited to have her back in the paint to fill that role and she’s doing great.”</p>\n<p>Even after her outstanding performance that weekend, it remained unpredictable just how “great” she would continue to do throughout the season and how much of an influence she would have on the team.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really have the mindset of ‘Oh I hope I do well,’” Marin said. “It was just what was expected, out of the whole entire team, even, not just myself.”</p>\n<p>The 5’10” center finished her last season with UCSB as the team’s leading scorer with 45 goals and a striking shooting percentage of .517, feats that helped her to earn Big West Player of the Week honors twice this season.</p>\n<p>However, the importance of her contributions to the team were not only in the amount of goals that she would put away each game, but also in their timing.</p>\n<p>On several occasions, Martin came in clutch when the team needed her the most. She had a couple of game-winners, some occurring in overtime, which would give the Gauchos the victory in addition to being a catalyst that occasionally sparked the team when it needed to recoup in dire situations.</p>\n<p>“Whenever I go in the game, it is my job to get a goal or set a teammate up with a really nice pass or earn an ejection so that someone else can score,” Martin said modestly. “My mindset going is to give 110 percent every time I go in the water.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the senior might attribute some of her collegiate success both in and out of the pool to her earlier years when she participated in the Olympic Development Program.</p>\n<p>The program’s purpose is develop players that will represent USA Water Polo throughout domestic and international competition. With such high expectations and the effort that is required of all athletes, the experience was beneficial beyond the depths of the pool, helping individuals improve as everyday people.</p>\n<p>“It showed me commitment, and just going into those practices knowing that you have eight hours of practice ahead, but knowing that it will all pay off in the long run teaches you determination,” Martin said. “It also helped with time management, knowing that I had a long practice ahead and I had to plan for school and other stuff I had to do.”</p>\n<p>While her career at UCSB might be over after the Big West Tournament, Martin hopes to continue doing what she loves in the future. While nothing is set in stone yet, word has it that this powerful player will be taking her talents overseas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70437\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70437\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/","id":1970,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[1969,1968,1967],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looking To Overcome Tough Losses and Win Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a tough loss that knocked them out of contention of the No. 1 seed, the Gauchos are ready to bounce back and try to win the Big West Tournament which will be hosted at home at Campus Pool.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Endless hours spent in the pool and long weekends of game after game have all concluded to this point of the year: the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70392\" style=\"width: 379px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70392\" data-attachment-id=\"70392\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/christinademarzo_wwaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70392\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?resize=369%2C244\" alt=\"Attempting to score, Samantha Murphy shoots the ball.

Despite the drawback, Santa Barbara finished its regular season schedule with a solid overall record of 15-12, 3-2 in conference play in spite of playing the vast majority of its games against the nation’s top-ranked teams.</p>\n<p>The Matadors, who have struggled all season, were incapable of winning a game in conference and finished 0-5 in the Big West with an overall record of 11-19.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow will be the second meeting between the two teams this year. In the first encounter, which took place roughly two weeks ago, the Gauchos dominated the second half of the match to give UCSB the 6-4 win on its Senior Day.</p>\n<p>Junior utility Taylor Shore had quite the match that day as she scored a pair of goals, drew three ejections and had three assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>Not to be overlooked, however, was senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw, who put up her fourth consecutive double-figure saves performance with a total of 13 blocks against Northridge.</p>\n<p>Despite their early victory over the Matadors, the Gauchos cannot let their past victory over the Matadors give them a false sense of confidence. The Big West Tournament is a thing of its own, regardless of the predetermined seedings, as every team comes in with a brand new slate, and anything can happen.</p>\n<p>“That [tournament seeding] still does not mean anything; they are going to come out, and they are a great team,” redshirt senior Lauren Martin said. “So, this week, we have been dedicating some practice time to watching game film, scouting and watching the players that they have and refreshing on what they do on offense and what they do on defense and how we can beat that.”</p>\n<p>Efficiency on the offensive side of the pool will prove to be crucial to Santa Barbara’s chances at a victory. In their last game of the season against Long Beach State, the Gauchos were unable to convert their shots into goals and it cost them the win despite outshooting the Beach 23-13. The team will rely on its top scorers in junior utility Miranda Schrader, Hudson and Martin, who leads the team with a total of 45 goals.</p>\n<p>Martin has proven to be an essential component to the team’s offense. The Fresno native has consistently initiated scoring runs for the Gauchos that have allowed them to secure a lead early in games. Aside from marking the pace, Martin has come in clutch with game-winning goals time after time throughout the season.</p>\n<p>As for the Matadors, they, too, possess an impact player of their own. A freshman attacker from Murrieta, Madeleine Sanchez, leads the Big West with an impressive amount of 71 goals in her first season.</p>\n<p>She also leads the team with a high of 42 assists. Santa Barbara’s defense will have their work cut out for them trying to find a way to get this powerful attacker off her game right away.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host the Big West Tournament at Campus Pool starting on Friday afternoon. UCSB will face CSUN this Friday, April 28 at 2 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>If Santa Barbara defeats CSUN, it will go on to face Long Beach State on Saturday, April 29 in a rematch that could send either team to the championship game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/","id":4989,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4988,4987,4986],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Late Goal Prevents No. 7 Gauchos From Capturing No. 1 Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the opportunity to capture the No. 1 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament, the No. 7 UCSB women's water polo team nearly earned the regular season title but were defeated by a game-winning ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The three-game winning streak came to a halt this past Saturday for the No.7 UCSB women’s water polo team after they were unable to hold on to its early lead against No. 13 Long Beach State in the season finale.

While for the Beach, the win made history. For the first time in its eight years of conference participation, LBSU has assumed the title of Big West regular season champions.</p>\n<p>The victory can be accredited to the 49ers defense, who did a remarkable job shutting down the Gauchos’ tenacious attackers. Their senior goalkeeper Alexis Butler, showed off her skills in her last regular season game obtaining a career-high with 17 saves. Despite UCSB outshooting the Beach 23-13, Butler made it almost impossible for the Gauchos to find the back of the net.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the first three minutes of the match, the Gauchos wasted no time attacking and put away three unanswered goals. The first came at the 6:36 mark from senior center Lauren Martin on a power play. Right after that junior utility Miranda Schrader went on to score two consecutive goals within a 43 second span giving UCSB an early lead.</p>\n<p>At the two minute mark, Long Beach drew an ejection and LBSU’s Alexandra Massier capatilized on the play with a pass from Jessica Brooks. The first quarter ended 3-1 despite several opportunities on both sides of the pool.</p>\n<p>Within 40 seconds of the second quarter, senior attacker Bryn Hudson reclaimed the three-goal lead for the Gauchos after an early exclusion. The shot however, did not go unreciprocated. Annabel Harman hit a bounce shot which skipped past senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw moving the score 4-2.</p>\n<p>After that the Gauchos had three consecutive possessions, but were unable to finish the plays. The first was saved by Butler, the second shot hit the right post and bounced back, while the third shot went off one of LBSU’s defenders.</p>\n<p>A shot from the 49ers closed the gap to 4-3, but the Gauchos had the last say before break with a backhanded goal from Martin with only 45 seconds left of the first half.</p>\n<p>The Beach battled their way back from a two-point deficit in the third quarter. With Emily Garcynski and Massier scoring one a piece on 6-on-5 situations, the Gauchos were shutout 2-0 and the game was tied 5-5 going into the fourth.</p>\n<p>The intensity of the game increased in the fourth quarter as both teams knew what was at stake and went at it with all they had. Neither team allowed a goal in the first five minutes of the period. It wasn’t until the 2:49 mark that the 49ers broke the silence and put one away to claim the lead for the first time in the game, 6-5. The Gauchos responded quickly knowing there was not much time left drawing an exclusions and finding the equalizer by Schrader, her third goal of the match.</p>\n<p>With 14 seconds left on the clock, the Beach had the final possession and they made use of it. Garczynski shot the ball after a couple of passes and scored in the last second to give the 49ers the victory.</p>\n<p>Brokaw finished with a total of 6 saves, four of them in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Although regular season is now over, the Gauchos will prepare to return home to Campus Pool this weekend to host the Big West Tournament. Santa Barbara, who is third-seeded will kick off the weekend with sixth seeded CSUN on Friday at 2 p.m. A win over the Matadors would give the Gauchos a rematch with Long Beach State on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/late-goal-prevents-no-7-gauchos-from-capturing-no-1-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/late-goal-prevents-no-7-gauchos-from-capturing-no-1-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/late-goal-prevents-no-7-gauchos-from-capturing-no-1-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/late-goal-prevents-no-7-gauchos-from-capturing-no-1-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/late-goal-prevents-no-7-gauchos-from-capturing-no-1-seed/","id":4970,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4969,4968,4967],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks To Capture Top Seed In Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite its 1-3 record on the road, the UCSB women's water polo team will attempt to upset Long Beach State on its home territory in addition to possibly locking up either a No. 1 or No.2 seed in next...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Since the start of the season back in January, Head Coach Serela Kay has talked about “trusting the process” throughout the year and letting it build a solid basis on which her team could rely on.

However, it will not be an easy task for the Gauchos, who will be facing No. 17 Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>For the first time in program history, the 49ers currently gloat an undefeated conference record. With a 16-9 overall and 3-0 record in the Big West, the Beach currently sits at the top of the conference rankings and is hoping to remain right where it’s at in order to claim its first Big West regular season title in the program’s eight years of conference participation.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos are one game behind the 49ers, the regular season title could go to either team at this point. Long Beach will have to win both games if it wants to complete an outright claim of the Big West title.</p>\n<p>With such high stakes on the line, the game will really come down to who wants to win the most and who is going to take everything that has been learned throughout the season and apply it in crunch time.</p>\n<p>One factor that can come into play for the 49ers is their home advantage. Long Beach currently holds a 6-1 home record — its only loss was about a month ago in a narrow 8-7 battle against San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The rowdiness of the Long Beach State fans is, however, the least of UCSB’s worries. The real challenge will be trying to contain its opponent’s offense, as LBSU has consistently put up 9.84 goals per game and only allows an average of 6.80 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Leading for the 49ers is the Canadian sophomore Virginia Smith with 41 goals this season. Right behind her are freshman Tori Morrissey and sophomore Alexandra Massier with a total of 34 and 33 goals, respectively.</p>\n<p>Aside from the three players previously mentioned, the 49ers’ roster consists of another four international players, which means they have great experience competing at high national levels — always a favorable quality to have in a team.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos, the team has been doing a superb job at communicating and feeding off of each other’s play. A key catalyst has been senior center Lauren Martin throughout the season, especially in the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>Martin was named Big West player of the week for her outstanding contribution to the team’s back-to-back victories over Hawaii and Davis two weekends ago. The Fresno native scored a couple of goals in the 7-6 victory over Davis, including a clutch goal in sudden death overtime to give the Gauchos the win. And against the ‘Bows, it was Martin’s goal who sparked a 3-0 run for Santa Barbara to win 7-5 along with two earned ejections.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will count on Martin to continue setting the pace for the offense this weekend and focus on working together to limit CSULB’s chances of scoring.</p>\n<p>The season finale will take place at Long Beach State this Saturday, April 23 starting at 12 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70195\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/ucsb-looks-to-capture-top-seed-in-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70195\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/ucsb-looks-to-capture-top-seed-in-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/ucsb-looks-to-capture-top-seed-in-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/ucsb-looks-to-capture-top-seed-in-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/ucsb-looks-to-capture-top-seed-in-big-west/","id":4969,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4968,4967,4966],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Pull Off Big Win On Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 9 UCSB extends its winning streak to three after defeating No. 24 CSUN this past weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 9 UCSB women’s water polo team continues riding the success of the past few weeks and dominated the second half of the game against No. 24 Cal State Northridge on Saturday afternoon to extend its winning streak to three games.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70045\" style=\"width: 208px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70045\" data-attachment-id=\"70045\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-pull-off-big-win-on-senior-day/brenna-thomas-makes-a-long-pass-to-a-teammate-jose-ochoa-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-1-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brenna Thomas makes a long pass to a teammate.

For the Matadors however, this was their fifth straight loss and their final game of the regular season. CSUN was unable to win any matches this season in the Big West and finished with a 0-5 record, 10-19 overall.</p>\n<p>Both teams struggled in the first half of the game, however, Northridge was unable to hold on to the lead it had sustained as UCSB pulled out the win with a good second half of play.</p>\n<p>The first three minutes of the game went scoreless. It was the Matadors who got on the board first with a penalty shot by Madeleine Sanchez after a foul at the 4:48 mark. Not even a minute later however, junior utility Taylor Shore found the back of the net to tie things up for the Gauchos. Shore took advantage of an ordinary foul three meters away while CSUN’s defense was unattentive.<br>\nWith 53 seconds left in the first period, Northridge reclaimed the lead on a power play with another goal by Sanchez. The first quarter ended with the Gauchos trailing 2-1, after senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw clinched a save off of a power play by the Matadors.</p>\n<p>Down by one point, Santa Barbara did not hesitate and came back to tie the game after Shore drew an ejection on the team’s first possession. The ball was sent straight to the upper right corner by senior attacker Bryn Hudson, collecting her first goal of the match and tying the game 2-2. Despite several 6-on-5 advantage opportunities for both teams, neither one was able to capitalize. CSUN alone had five opportunities, but Santa Barbara held a strong defense making it impossible for the Matadors to put the ball in the cage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos claimed the lead for the first time in the match at the 3:40 mark after sophomore utility Camila Schafer drew an ordinary foul at mid pool and found Shore on the right wing for a pass. Shore would then put the ball away to collect her second goal of the game, but the lead was short-lived because 32 seconds after, CSUN’s Miranda coleman took the ball deep to notch the equalizer.</p>\n<p>In the last 16 minutes of the game, UCSB went on a 3-1 run ignited by Hudson with a long shot over the Matador’s keeper Niki Van Vugt putting the Gauchos up 4-3. Once again it appeared as though Northridge would tie the game with a penalty shot opportunity with 1:51 on the clock, but Brokaw came through with a clutch save that allowed the Gauchos to stay on top.</p>\n<p>But Brokaw wasn’t the only one not allowing the Matadors to score. Schafer had a block 2:47 mark and senior center Lauren Martin had a major steal in front of the goal to hold CSUN down.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter started off quickly as Shore drew an ejection to give Santa Barbara an opportunity to extend its lead. With a straight on shot from senior utility Samantha Murphy, the gauchos led 5-3. With a pass from Shore, junior utility Miranda Schrader was able to put the nail in the coffin and secure the win for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Despite a comeback attempt from the Matadors, their last goal came a little too late in the game. The Gauchos worked the rest of the clock to finish with a 6-4 victory.</p>\n<p>The win was significantly special for the seniors who celebrated their Gauchos’ Senior Day. Hudson ended with two goals, along with Shore who also collected three assists, three earned ejections, and two steals.</p>\n<p>In the cage, Brokaw put up her fourth consecutive double figure saves performance. Aside from Brokaw, Schafer also played a key role in the back side of the pool. The sophomore had three steals and a clutch block in the second half of the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play its last regular season at Long Beach State next Saturday before the Big West Tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70070\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-pull-off-big-win-on-senior-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70070\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-pull-off-big-win-on-senior-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-pull-off-big-win-on-senior-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-pull-off-big-win-on-senior-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-pull-off-big-win-on-senior-day/","id":4971,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4970,4969,4968],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks To Continue Climbing Conference Ladder","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to defeat fellow Big West opponent, CSUN, and try to move up in the conference rankings as playoff time approaches.

Now with a 2-1 record in the Big West, Santa Barbara is tied with No. 9 UCI for third place in the conference standings as well as tied for ninth in the nation.</p>\n<p>The two wins were a major confidence boost for the Gauchos after dropping their season opener at Irvine. With postseason right around the corner, they need to continue performing at this level in order to win their last two games and make a deep run in playoffs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Matadors, who have struggled throughout the season against higher-ranked opponents, are coming into the week with a 10-18 overall record. With a four-game losing streak and a 0-4 Big West record, CSUN sits in last place in conference.</p>\n<p>Odds point to Santa Barbara for this weekend after winning all 10 games played against lower ranked teams; however, this does not mean that the Gauchos have nothing to worry about. The last time these two teams faced off, it was the Matadors who came out on top 8-6 in last season’s conference play.</p>\n<p>“Momentum is on our side with the two victories last weekend, but the Big West is the most competitive conference.” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “Every team is competitive and can win on any given day.  It is critical we are present and attack every possession on both ends of the pool.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s main threat is Madeleine Sanchez. CSUN’s sophomore attacker leads the Big West with 66 goals in total, averaging 2.36 per game in her 28 matches this year. The Murrieta-native tallied 28 goals her freshman season as a Matador, third on the team and reached a team-high of six goals in a 14-8 win over Azusa Pacific.</p>\n<p>This year, she leads the team in goals as well as assists with 41. Not only is Sanchez an offensive threat, but she has also shown she can defend the ball quite well collecting 53 steals, the second highest in the team.</p>\n<p>With such a sharp shooter in play, the Gauchos’ defense must remain strong throughout the entire game. In past matches Santa Barbara has failed to capitalize when they have a lead and have ended up in tough situations as a result — such as the UCI loss two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>“Last weekend we focused on team defense and getting behind each other no matter what happens.” Coach Kay said. “ We have been focusing on trusting the process throughout the year/season.  This has built a foundation for us to lean on.”</p>\n<p>“The biggest challenge this weekend and for the rest of the season is to trust the process and stay present.” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “This is something that will allow us to be victorious.”</p>\n<p>Apart from the defense, the Gauchos will also need to be efficient on the opposite side of the pool. However, all season they have proven that they can play as a team, and the captain of this team is senior Lauren Martin.</p>\n<p>After redshirting last season, Martin came back with everything she had this year. She has constantly put up big numbers, especially in crucial situations such as sudden deaths. To no surprise, it was her who put away the goal that gave UCSB its victory over Davis last weekend in the 8th quarter.</p>\n<p>Along with Martin, the Gauchos will also look to senior attacker Bryn Hudson to set the pace with her assists.

Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Despite falling to UCSB in Saturday’s match, the Aggies picked up their first conference win this weekend with a 10-9 triumph over CSUN on Sunday. Davis is now 15-11 and 1-3 in the tournament. As for the Rainbow Wahine, their loss against the Gauchos ended their five game winning streak and ruined their undefeated season. The loss sends them into the number two spot in the Big West with a 3-1 track, but still hold an impressive 18-6 overall record.</p>\n<p>An outstanding performance by the Gauchos in the third quarter against Hawaii proved to be the kill for the Rainbow Wahine’s undefeated title in conference play. This was also UCSB’s first victory over the University of Hawaii since 2004, a time in which when both teams were competing in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara managed to get on the board three minutes into the game with a goal by junior attacker Brenna Thomas. However, UH’s Danika Kotylak responded a minute later to tie the game up 1-1 in the first quarter. Junior attacker Miranda Schrader returned the lead to the Gauchos with one minute remaining in the period, but it was not long before Femke Ann netted a buzzer-beater to knot the score going into the second quarter.</p>\n<p>With less than 4 minutes left of the second period, Hawai’i claimed the lead for the first time in the game with a goal by Irene Gonzalez. The see-saw battle continued as Santa Barbara’s junior attacker Jenna Solberg found the back of the net right before going into halftime. The Gauchos’ run continued after the break with Schrader flipping the ball on a pass to Hudson who finished the task.</p>\n<p>As a result of a smooth move by senior center Lauren Martin evading two defenders, the Gauchos extended their lead to 5-3. The ‘Bows tried to come back with a goal at the 3:10 mark, but senior attacker Bryn Hudson shut that down when she capitalized on a power play opportunity. Leading 6-4 into the fourth, the Gauchos were able to hold back Hawaii’s offense to only one goal which would not be enough to overcome the deficit.</p>\n<p>Sealing the deal junior defender Sophie Trabucco took advantage of yet another play and scored the last goal for the Gauchos to finish off the upset 7-5.</p>\n<p>One day prior to this great victory however, Santa Barbara found itself in a tough battle against the Aggies. Up until this weekend, Davis had been unable to win a game in conference play and it was close to claiming UCSB as its first victory.</p>\n<p>Both teams came out strong defensively making it impossible for either of them to score. The game remained 0-0 up until the 4:56 mark when senior goalkeeper MacKenzie Brokaw threw a long pass to Thomas who then netted her first goal of the game. The Gauchos held the lead until the 2:40 point of the period when the Aggies answered back on a power play.</p>\n<p>In the final minute of the quarter, Trabucco scored one goal only to have the Rainbow Wahine retaliate 20 seconds later. The score was tied 2-2 at the end of the first period. Davis claimed the lead in the second quarter and after a couple of failed attempts by the Gauchos, the game went into halftime with the Aggies leading by one point.</p>\n<p>After the halftime, Santa Barbara found the equalizer right away as Murphy took advantage of a power play. This back and forth battle carried out for the remainder of the game, which eventually resulted in overtime.</p>\n<p>With a powerful shot at the top right corner of the goal by Murphy, the Gauchos claimed the lead in the first period of overtime. Just when it seemed that the lead was about to be taken away from them by a power play, sophomore utility Camila Schafer shut down the play with a block helping Santa Barbara conserve its lead.</p>\n<p>However, UC Davis sent the game into sudden death after scoring within the first minute of the second period of overtime. Thanks to an amazing save by Brokaw, the seventh period finished without any goals and the fight continued in the eight.</p>\n<p>Here, the Gauchos saw their opportunity for victory on a steal by Hudson. The offense passed the ball around waiting for the perfect opportunity to attack until Hudson found Martin.</p>\n<p>With a backhanded throw Martin ended the game in favor of UCSB. It was exciting and successful weekend for the Gauchos indeed, proving that they are a top contender in the Big West. UCSB will face Cal State Northridge in its penultimate match of regular season this Saturday, April 16  at 12 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>After a rugged match against Hawai’i, which resulted in a loss in overtime, the Aggies are on the hunt for a couple of wins this weekend that will help them climb back up.</p>\n<p>A main contributor that will help turnaround this season is senior center Allyson Hansen who has scored 42 goals this season, making up 20% of the team’s total.</p>\n<p>Hansen was named All-Big West Conference Second Team in the 2015 season after tallying 37 goals and 19 assists for a total of 56 points.</p>\n<p>Aside from Hansen, the Aggies will need to count on Bryn Lutz and Carla Tocchini who are tied with 34 goals each this season to help them break their losing streak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos other opponents, the Rainbow Wahine, will try to improve upon their four-game winning streak and remain undefeated in conference play.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Serela Kay is no stranger to Hawai’i, as she was the Assistant Head Coach for the Rainbow Wahine two years prior to coming to Santa Barbara last season.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Coach Kay helped the ‘Bows during one of their most successful seasons in which they won the regular season Big West Championship and advanced to their first NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>Aside from that history, the Gauchos have faced Hawai’i a total of 30 times in school history, mustering only four wins during that span.</p>\n<p>To defeat UH would not only be a huge win for the Gauchos conference record since every game is crucial, but it would also revenge last year’s match which resulted in a 7-3 victory for the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>The player to watch out for is the Barcelona native Irene Gonzalez. The freshman attacker averages 2.71 goals per games with a total of 57 over the last 21 games.</p>\n<p>Prior to competing in college, Gonzalez helped her team win silver at the FINA World Junior Water Polo Championships in 2015. She also competed for the Spain team that won silver and bronze in the European Championships in 2012 and 2014, respectively.</p>\n<p>In order to succeed this weekend, the Gauchos will look to senior center Lauren Martin to set the pace early in the game as she usually does. Martin has been a great asset to the team this entire season leading the team with 40 goals thus far. She does an outstanding job at not only winning the first possession, but also finding the back of the net within seconds of playtime.</p>\n<p>Aside from Martin, Santa Barbara has several players that create a strong offensive side for UCSB. One of them is junior utility Taylor Shore who is right behind Martin with 39 goals this season.</p>\n<p>The other is senior attacker Bryn Hudson who knows that assists are just as crucial to the game as goals which is why she has the best balance of both with 32 goals and 34 assists.</p>\n<p>The defense is led by senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw who is a great force in the cage making sure opposing teams have a hard time finding the back of the net. Brokaw leads the Big West for most saved goals with 175.</p>\n<p>This weekend will prove to be a challenge for the Gauchos, however, they are presented with a great opportunity to win their first conference game as well as upset two of the better teams in the nation and prove they can compete with the best.</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to play at noon against UC Davis at Campus Pool this Saturday, and Hawai’i on Sunday at Campus Pool at 12 P.M.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69545\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-14-gauchos-shoot-for-first-conference-win-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69545\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-14-gauchos-shoot-for-first-conference-win-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-14-gauchos-shoot-for-first-conference-win-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-14-gauchos-shoot-for-first-conference-win-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/no-14-gauchos-shoot-for-first-conference-win-this-weekend/","id":5471,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5470,5469,5468],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Tough Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/JoseOchoa-WWaterPolo-1-23-16-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/JoseOchoa-WWaterPolo-1-23-16-6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB musters only one goal in the second half and lose its conference opener to No. 6 UCI.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 14 UCSB women’s water polo team faced the No. 6 UC Irvine Anteaters for their first Big West match this past Sunday.

The first by Mary Brooks who took advantage of an exclusion with an assist by Gabby Pierandozzi. The second came from a pass from Brooks to Pierandozzi.</p>\n<p>With 29 seconds left in the first quarter, junior utility Miranda Schrader knocked one in after capitalizing on a power play to cut the ‘Eaters momentary lead short.</p>\n<p>In the second period of the game, UCSB shut down Irvine’s offense. Senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had five saves preventing the Anteaters from scoring. Once again Martin struck at the 4:59 mark on a 6-5 advantage.</p>\n<p>A minute leader senior attacker Bryn Hudson followed her lead and put one in the back of the net for the first time in the game.  The Gauchos now had a two-point lead going into the second half of the game with the score at 4-2.</p>\n<p>UCI came out ready to fight back in the second half and scored three straight goals. After a block from Pierandozzi, Brooks put the first goal of the trio away.</p>\n<p>Pierandozzi then converted on the penalty with an assist by Emily Carlson. Natalie Seidemann then took a pass from Brooks to give the Anteaters a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>With seconds of the third quarter left, Hudson once again found the net on an exclusion and tied the game up before going into the last quarter. Four of UCSB’s five goals came from power plays.</p>\n<p>Irvine carried its momentum to the fourth quarter of the match, where they shutdown the Gauchos 3-0. Five saves from UCI’s goalkeeper Annika Nelson and defensive steals by Brooks made it impossible for UCSB to score.</p>\n<p>Martin and Hudson both ended the game with a pair of goals, while Schrader contributed one as well. Senior utility Samantha Murphy directed the offense and collected two assists.</p>\n<p>Brokaw maintained busy in the cage and tallied a total of 16 saves in the game, a season high while also collecting a steal.</p>\n<p>Although it was the first conference match, there is less than a month left before the Big West Tournament. This means that the Gauchos will have to remain focused and use what they learned from the loss to win the next couple of games. They cannot let up once they take a lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to the Campus Pool next weekend to host UC Davis on Saturday at 12 P.M. and Hawai’i on Sunday once again at noon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69378\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/gauchos-drop-tough-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69378\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/gauchos-drop-tough-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/gauchos-drop-tough-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/gauchos-drop-tough-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/gauchos-drop-tough-conference-opener/","id":5458,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5457,5456,5455],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to Irvine to Start Conference Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are ready to kick off conference play against UCI.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Spring quarter is on its way and so is conference play.

With more than a handful of players stepping up all year, the Gauchos now lead the Big West with 226 goals scored, averaging 10.27 goals per game.</p>\n<p>In the first 11 matches UCSB averaged 10.6 goals per game, but in the second half of non-conference the average improved to 12 games per game.</p>\n<p>This accomplishment could not be done without several key players such as leading scorer junior utility Taylor Shore. She has 39 goals in the last 22 games averaging 1.99 goals per game, as well as 18 assists.</p>\n<p>The Corona native has shown outstanding skills not only offensively, but offensively as well. With 36 steals thus far in the season plus her past years, she now holds the record for the most steals of any Gaucho.</p>\n<p>Right behind her is senior center Lauren Martin with 38 goals and 40 earned ejections, after redshirting last season. Senior attacker Bryn Hudson not only has contributed 30 goals, but she has also led the team in assists with a total of 33.</p>\n<p>Aside from leading the other teams scoring wise, Santa Barbara also holds the spot for most goalkeeper saves thanks to senior goalkeeper MacKenzie Brokaw. In the 696 minutes that she has played, Brokaw has had 175 saves, averaging 7.95 saves per game.</p>\n<p>Although winning the Big West will not be an easy task with opponents such as No. 4 Hawaii amongst others in the mix, the Gauchos count with a solid team on both ends of the pool that can really take them far this season.</p>\n<p>To kick off the journey to the top, the first challenge will be to defeat the Anteaters this Sunday.</p>\n<p>UCI, who is 13-9 overall, is returning home after playing three matches on the island. Although they fell to Hawaii in a close game 3-2, Irvine collected two wins over No. 10 UC San Diego and No. 24 Bakersfield. This helped the climb a spot on the rankings.</p>\n<p>The biggest offensive threat to Santa Barbara is their lead scorer Mary Brooks who has a total of 39 goals in the last 22 games, followed by Gabby Pierandozzi with 19.</p>\n<p>One of the major keys to the Anteaters’ success is their coaching staff. Both their head coach and assistant coach’s U.S women’s team has just secured a berth in the 2016 Olympics in Brazil after winning the qualification tournament.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s conference opener will take place at UC Irvine and will begin at 12 P.M.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/ucsb-travels-to-irvine-to-start-conference-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/ucsb-travels-to-irvine-to-start-conference-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/ucsb-travels-to-irvine-to-start-conference-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/ucsb-travels-to-irvine-to-start-conference-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/ucsb-travels-to-irvine-to-start-conference-play/","id":5459,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5458,5457,5456],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Stay Hot And Extend Winning Streak to Four","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB extends its' hot streak to four straight victories after defeating La Verne and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps this past weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68908\" style=\"width: 394px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68908\" data-attachment-id=\"68908\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/wwaterpolo_vsucsd-20160124-dustinharris-9-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68908\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=384%2C576\" alt=\"Sophie Trabucco wrestles off a defender and tries to pass.

Redshirt senior center Lauren Martin started the scoring at the <span data-term=\"goog_209240815\">7:29</span> mark, which led to the Gauchos going on an unanswered run of seven goals in the first quarter.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior attacker Brenna Thomas and utility freshman Sarah Krieser each had one goal, while junior utility Taylor Shore and Samantha Murphy also had two goals each.</p>\n<p>The momentum carried on into the second period in which Santa Barbara scored another five goals.

By the end of the first half UCSB was up 11-1 after four goals scored in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara shut C-M-S in the second half, while adding eight more goals, making it impossible for the Athenas to come back from the 18-point defecit.</p>\n<p>Between both games Shore scored a total of eight goals, to put her on top in the scoring column. Martin trailed her with five goals and Murphy with four, all against La Verne.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next match is at home against Harvard Saturday, March 19 at Campus Pool at 2:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-stay-hot-and-extend-winning-streak-to-four/","id":5457,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5456,5455,5454],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 14 UCSB to Conclude Road Trip at Claremont Convergence Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The final two matches of the UCSB women's water polo team's road journey will end this Saturday as it prepares to face La Verne and Claremont Mudd-Scripps in the Claremont Convergence Tournament.

This weekend will be Santa Barbara’s best opportunity to capitalize since it is the only ranked team amongst its opponents.</p>\n<p>So far the Gauchos have only played one game against an unranked opponent, Cal Baptist, and took home the victory 10-4. Despite the statistics, Coach Kay knows that numbers do not matter at the end of the day, assuring that the team’s “mentality does not change with opponent.”</p>\n<p>The first matchup will be against the University of La Verne, who is 3-0 thus far this season. It was an encouraging 2015 season for the Leopards, who finished with an overall record of 7-14 under first-year Head Coach William Rodriguez. Despite being a year full of changes and adjustments, La Verne managed to surprise everyone by taking fifth-place in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest strengths that La Verne depends on is its depth. With seven returning players and a great recruiting class, the Leopards have players ready to step in when needed or just to keep a fresh group in the water. This helps the team maintain their attack strong, going on unanswered runs right away that make it hard for their opponent to try to come back. So far, two of its three wins have been by a double-figure margin. Most notably, in the Leopards’ season opener, they defeated Grove City College by a score of 24-3.</p>\n<p>Although it is a young team, the Leopards have a roster with talented players such as freshman attacker Guarina Garcia. The Puerto Rico native has scored nine goals in La Verne’s three matches. She is a member of the Puerto Rico senior national team, as well as the junior national team. Garcia won a silver medal at the XXII Central American and Caribbean games and has played in several of the Pan-Am games.</p>\n<p>The second game of the day will be against Claremont Mudd-Scripps, who is 1-5 overall so far this season. Its lone victory came in its opening match against Concordia. The Athenas finished 11-17 overall, 8-3 in conference last year and took third-place at the SCIAC Championships.</p>\n<p>It seems to be that Claremont’s biggest challenge is its defense’s inability to prevent opponents from scoring. Out of its five losses, four of them were by 10 points or more. No. 6 Hawaii and No.21 Long Beach defeated the Athenas 20-3, 20-5 respectively.</p>\n<p>The leading scorer for Claremont is Santa Barbara native, sophomore attacker Jessica Gaffney, who has a total of eight goals in the last five games.

Santa Barbara’s first goal of the match came at the 1:52 mark of the second period by redshirt junior utility Miranda Schrader. Cal quickly responded to the score, giving the Bears a three-point advantage at halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense was able to limit the Bears’ scoring the first five minutes of the third period, but Cal was able to get two goals in before the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite senior center Lauren Martin, senior attacker Bryn Hudson, and sophomore utility Camila Schafer scoring one each, the match resulted in an 8-4 victory for Cal.</p>\n<p>The loss to Cal led the Gauchos to face Pacific in the second game of the day.</p>\n<p>This time UCSB attacked first and found the back of the net twice by the 5:16 mark. The Tigers retaliated with two goals of their own tying up the game, but thanks to junior utility Taylor Shore it was not for long. The junior gave the Gauchos the lead with her shot at the 0:27 mark of the first quarter.</p>\n<p>In the second period the Tigers came back and grabbed the lead after a two-goal streak, but once again the scoreboard was tied up when freshman defender Kristen Denney scored one more.</p>\n<p>After a back and forth battle for the lead in the third quarter, the game remained tied up 6-6 going into the last period of the game. It was Pacific that managed to get the winning goal at the 1:42 mark earning the Tigers the win.</p>\n<p>Junior attacker Brenna Thomas had two goals against Pacific, while senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had 14 saves adding up to a total of 21 for the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos turned it around the second day sweeping up the competition. In the first game of the day, UCSB collected its first win of the weekend against San Diego State in an overtime battle. It was the second time that the teams had met, once in the Michigan Invitational in which Santa Barbara also came out on top in a 9-8 victory.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs opened up the board with a goal at the two-minute mark, to which UCSB responded with two consecutive goals courtesy of Thomas giving them a one-point deficit lead going into the half.</p>\n<p>The momentum was carried on to the third quarter where the Gauchos scored another two goals for a 4-0 run.</p>\n<p>With the score at 4-1, the Aztecs turned on the jets and put away three goals unanswered. After an ejection drawn by Schrader, junior defender Sophie Trabucco took advantage of the power play and put away the equalizer.</p>\n<p>The first period of overtime went scoreless, then with 1:22 left of the second Trabucco finds the back of the net once again. However, the Aztecs scored thirty seconds later to what seemed would take the game into a sudden death match.</p>\n<p>Just when the cards seemed to have been dealt, Martin came in clutch for the Gauchos drawing an ejection. The senior center did not let the opportunity go to waste, capitalizing on it and giving Santa Barbara the close win 7-6.</p>\n<p>Enhancing Santa Barbara’s momentous win over the Aztecs was its victory against Loyola Marymount to end the day which ended in a 15-12 shootout.</p>\n<p>Martin and Shore both scored five goals each, followed by Schrader with four of her own, and Hudson with one to claim the victory.</p>\n<p>Wasting no time, the Gauchos dominated the first quarter going on a four-goal streak. They maintained the lead throughout the rest of the first half to go into half time leading 7-5.</p>\n<p>Despite an attempted comeback from LMU in the fourth quarter with five goals, the Gauchos had locked in their victory and gathered their second win of the tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face La Verne next at the Axelrod Pool on Saturday, March 5. The match will begin at 1:00 P.M.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/","id":5454,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5453,5452,5451],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/322"}},"__N_SSG":true}
