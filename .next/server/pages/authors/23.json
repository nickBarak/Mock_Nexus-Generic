The Anteaters kept the first set close at 21-19, before the ‘Chos overwhelmed the Irvine team with 4 straight points. After this point UC Irvine took themselves out of the game as their errors compounded one after the other leading to an almost effortless 25-11 second set win for the ‘Chos. While the Anteaters got less and less efficient as the match progressed from the first to the second set, the ‘Chos did the opposite, winning the hitting percentage battle .304 to .051 on the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a league with as high parity as the Big West, it’s very difficult and next to impossible to win any game hitting as poorly as .051, especially against a UCSB team who has cemented their place as one of the premier blocking teams and the most efficient hitting offenses in the country. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting down 2-1 the Anteaters made a valiant comeback and had the game tied at 20-20 in the third set. Ultimately they were not able to convert and allowed the ‘Chos to end the set with a 5-1 run to complete the sweep. In the third set in particular, senior Lindsey Ruddins made her presence felt with a solo block, a kill and a joint block with Rowan Ennis to end the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This game was also highlighted by a balanced setting effort by both Olivia Lovenberg and Romoni Vivao, who had 20 and 17 assists respectively. With nearly all cogs off the offense working at maximum capacity and Irvine making as many errors as they did, the Gauchos pushed their win streak to 11 straight games and aimed to carry this momentum over to their game against Cal State Fullerton the next day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Chos ran away with the game against Fullerton from the start. The closest the game was was 3-3 in the first set, but after a quick 5-0 run the ‘Chos went on to close out the first set 25-15. Fullerton was unable to hit efficiently, similar to Irvine, and also was unable to keep up with the ‘Chos offense. Fullerton outside Julia Crawford logged 11 kills but with the all-around offensive output of the ‘Chos, her 11 kills were not enough to offset the Gaucho efficiency. The ‘Chos hit .321 to Fullerton’s .032 and were thus blown out every set (the lowest point differential being 8). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recurring theme for this Gaucho team is the extremely efficient hitting. With such a star-studded offense, opponents can seldom hope to negatively influence the UCSB hitting squad — and are thus required to try to match the offensive output themselves to have a shot at winning. It’s hard enough to match the scoring output of a star player like Ruddins, but factoring in the bench depth and next to flawless setting — it’s almost impossible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as both Lovenberg and Vivao keep playing as well as they have, the ‘Chos are head and shoulders above almost any opposition. Tallying 21 and 19 assists respectively, this setting duo has done a phenomenal job at running the offense and continue to excel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Chos will definitely be coming back Friday, Oct. 4, with a lot of confidence for their game against UC Davis and look to extend their win streak even further to 12 straight. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90026\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-29/gauchos-take-down-uci-and-csuf-extend-win-streak-to-11/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90026\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-29/gauchos-take-down-uci-and-csuf-extend-win-streak-to-11/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-29/gauchos-take-down-uci-and-csuf-extend-win-streak-to-11/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-29/gauchos-take-down-uci-and-csuf-extend-win-streak-to-11/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-29/gauchos-take-down-uci-and-csuf-extend-win-streak-to-11/","id":4883,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[4882,4881,4880],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hold Down Home Court, Dominate Thunderdome Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2019-09-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NicoleWallace051018-WVolleyballvsHawaii-print-e1541043513513.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NicoleWallace051018-WVolleyballvsHawaii-print-e1541043513513.jpg?resize=900%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The weekend kicked off as the ‘Chos played the University of San Diego on Friday Sept. 13.

Rowan Ennis continues to come up big in key moments by adding 10 kills and eight blocks while allowing UCSB to put away USD late in the contest by catalyzing an 8-1 run which put the third set out of reach. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman Romoni Vivao posted 25 assists and nine digs in her first ever home game putting the cherry on top of a commanding win. USD put up a good fight, but ultimately could not match the offensive onslaught of the ‘Chos </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Megan Jacobsen putting up 16 kills and the rest of the team much farther behind that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Salle University was UCSB’s second challenger in the Thunderdome Classic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Salle seemed to be the biggest threat to the ‘Chos with the high offensive output from outside Samantha Graver, who went on to put up 20 kills. Other than Graver, the rest of La Salle was unable to play at a high enough efficiency throughout the game to get the win. The ‘Chos swept La Salle 3-0. Ruddins was two kills short of pushing the 20-kill streak to four straight games, but still provided the majority of the Gaucho offense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ennis put up an impenetrable blocking wall, boasting seven kills out of the 50 total Gaucho kills. Ennis has frankly played on another level these past few weeks. She has really been able to cement herself as a defensive force on the court that teams are going to have trouble scheming around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Chos played Harvard on Saturday marking the final game in the Thunderdome invitational. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos beat Harvard 3-1 in yet another dominating performance. For a team that recently struggled with serving in their previous invitationals, UCSB won this game with their serving </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> posting 11 aces to Harvard’s two. In addition the ‘Chos put up 22 blocks to Harvard’s 11. Ennis came up huge posting 13 kills and six blocks. With yet another elite hitting and blocking performance by Ennis its safe to say she has emerged as the much needed second or third option for UCSB after Ruddins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A question for this team coming into the year was how the team would respond to losing integral veteran players, and throughout the first three invitationals Ennis reassured the ‘Chos to not worry. Look for her to play a continually more significant role in the upcoming matches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ennis came up big again and was rewarded with the Invitational MVP award and All-Tournament Team honors. Ruddins and Tallulah Fowler also made the All-Tournament Team. With that Gaucho players made up almost 50% of the All-Tournament Team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Chos will look to carry this momentum into their game on Wednesday against UCLA at home. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

It’s even more imperative now more than ever that the ‘Chos get out to a good start and don’t fall behind early and play catch-up like last season.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without the consistent leadership presence of a veteran like Petrachi the team needs less-featured players to take the next step and fill the void if they want any chance to come close to their expectations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This weekend, look for sophomore Gigi Ruddins and her older sister senior Lindsey Ruddins to make a statement. Lindsey is as decorated as any player in the league – boasting a three-time AVCA All-American Honorable Mention selection and putting up an outworldly 5.34 k/s which ranks her as the second-most efficient outside in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gigi will be looking to take that next step as she fills the role Petrachi played. After putting up an impressive freshman season (All-Big West Freshman Team) the ‘Chos desperately need her to post another stellar season for them to reach anywhere close to their potential. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main weakness for this Gaucho team at the moment seems to be their blocking with their lineups featuring an undersized setter, Olivia Lovenberg, who is 5’8”. Her efficiency on offense negates this as she leads the conference in assists and became the second player to reach 1000 assists. Expect games this season to become Big 12 football-style shootouts, as Lovenberg airs out sets to premier hitters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such a star-studded offensive unit we would also be remiss if we did not mention middle Rowan Ennis. With the elite Ruddins sisters playing outside and a facilitator like Lovenberg, expect Ennis to put up big numbers as well, especially considering the amount of defensive pressure Lindsey absorbs on her own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Long Island University team the ‘Chos will play against has a roster with a very high upside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of their blocking, the LIU team runs a high octane offense run by setter Amanda Hubbard. In order for the Guachos to win tomorrow look for them to use their high tempo offense to beat out the LIU blockers to generate long point streaks and keeping the LIU team from getting in system. Where “in system” refers to being capable of setting the middle in a given play. Without being able to set the middle, the opposing blocking middle has an easier time cheating to either end to put up a block – which greatly improves the outcome for the defending team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a team this young there are a lot of x factors, but the biggest one will most likely be Ennis.

Other deals were a lot less expected, like Jimmy Butler signing with the Heat and Al Horford signing a four-year 110 million dollar deal from the 76ers as he approaches age 34.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now we get to the absolute shocker, the deal so unexpected some consider it to be downright blasphemous: Kawhi Leonard signing the max with the Clippers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fairness, Kawhi Leonard signing with the Clippers is not the issue here. He is an eligible free agent and can exercise his right to sign with a new team. The issue comes because he recruited a second star, Paul George from the OKC Thunder, to join him in LA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After trying to get Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to join him on the Clippers to no avail (both of whom signed with Brooklyn promptly at the start of free agency), Leonard convinced a player who finished third in MVP voting and who just had his career-best year to leave his team while under a three-year contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as the deal ended, everyone called foul.Paul George forced his way out of Indiana, Leonard had his drama with San Antonio two years later, Anthony Davis created a commotion in NOLA to be traded to the Lakers earlier this year, and now Paul George yet again forced his way out of another team in OKC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The increased player movement seen in the last decade has been a controversial topic amongst NBA fans. When I say player movement, I’m not referring to teaming up in free agency; I’m specifically referring to under-contract players who force their team’s hand in an attempt to leave their respective organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fans are pro-player and feel it is well within a player’s right to leave their current team if he does not want to be there any more. Their reasoning is that when teams trade players away it’s considered a business move and when players leave, it should be seen in a similar light.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other fans, however, are less in favor of the players, citing that large-market teams are usually the continued benefactors of this movement, relegating the smaller markets to be in the background of the league. New Orleans was an irrelevant team until they landed generational talent, Anthony Davis. But Davis forced his way out of NOLA to the Lakers, who have been a major market since the beginning of basketball itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) has provisions to try to incentivize players to stay loyal to a franchise with large monetary benefits the incumbent teams can present </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> however, in this free agency alone, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard gave up a combined 200 million dollars in financial benefits by moving to their new respective teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s very apparent that for the elite-level players, the financial incentives presented by the CBA are not enough to mitigate their movement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So where do we go from here? NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has been vocal in trying to explore new incentives and methods to mitigate the current level of player movement. Prominent media members are split on the issue and some have called for radical changes, like having players not be trade eligible for X number of years after signing to prevent them from forcing their way out.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halting player movement entirely isn’t ideal either. Player movement adds a necessary intrigue to the league but the current level has shifted the landscape of the NBA too drastically and too often to allow it to continue at this level. Although it is unlikely that any rules to stop the phenomenon will come soon, be on the lookout for some big changes to come in the upcoming years. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/","id":47,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[46,45,44],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How the West Stacks Up: Conference Seeding Predictions","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2019-07-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/66853598_1941837039249998_4199435760069246976_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/66853598_1941837039249998_4199435760069246976_n.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Here are the favorites even amongst a high-parity Western Conference.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"269763473\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89332\"><img data-attachment-id=\"89333\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/western_conference_nba_logo_2018/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png?fit=2400%2C1320&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1320\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Western_Conference_(NBA)_logo_2018\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png?fit=888%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89333\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Western_Conference_NBA_logo_2018.png?resize=888%2C488\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"488\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the NBA free agency frenzy coming to an end, NBA teams and fans alike can start looking toward the upcoming season.

Jerry West took an already stellar defensive team and added the two best defensive wings in the game. They are the favorites to win it all and it is very clear why.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 2 Seed: Denver Nuggets</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nuggets looked like a strong team that fought and clawed its way to the No. 2 seed this prior season with a very young roster. Eventually losing in the second round in a game seven, the Nuggets added depth and athleticism with Jerami Grant. The team performed phenomenally. However, with no set small forward in their rotation and the defensive issues from starting point guard Jamal Murray, there are concerns that need to be addressed going into the next season. The Denver squad will be a very good team, but are still one or two years off from being a true contender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 3 seed: LA Lakers</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lakers on paper look like a very scary team. An Anthony Davis and LeBron James pick and roll is every team’s worst nightmare, especially when Danny Green is spotting up for a three in the wing. Running LeBron at the point, this roster is huge and will present a lot of problems for teams offensively and on the boards. Notice how I didn’t say defensively there. With the prevalence of stretch fives, it’s not too hard to scheme around Anthony Davis’ abilities as a rim protector. In addition, DeMarcus Cousins and LeBron James leave much to be desired defensively. Going into year 17, LeBron is definitely not playing the best defense of his career and Cousins, who was always a step slower, has just suffered two major injuries to his knee and quadricep and is thus going to be a huge asterisk defensively. Davis is also known for getting knicks and knacks here and there that keep him out for short periods of time, but in this neck-and-neck Western Conference, that will cost LA some games and their seeding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 seed: Houston Rockets</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Houston may have started falling apart before our very eyes after being eliminated by a Kevin Durant less Warriors team. Chris Paul and James Harden are feuding because of the playstyle they play – which favors Harden and no one else. It’s clear that the players and administration have lost all faith in Head Coach Mike D’antoni and Free Agency did not go in their favor at all as they did not sign any notable Free agents and are set to run it back with almost the same team. Here’s the catch however: GM Daryl Morey might of just saved all of their blunders by trading for a league MVP and former teammate of James Harden, Russel Westbrook. Their isolation playstyle has not panned out now 3 years in a row and is unlikely to work a 4th, but with Westbrook and Hardens pre-existing chemistry and D’antoni reverting back to his Phoenix offense rather than his current iso offense, Houston has effectively reopened their window for a championship. They switched out an aging star with injury concerns to replace him with a high octane player who has a reputation for being the ironman of the NBA. There are concerns with Westbrook’s scoring efficiency, but the elite level playmaking he brings to any squad is well worth any offensive concern one might have.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 5 seed: Utah Jazz</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utah has been one very strong defensive unit that has stukk largely underperformed in the playoffs due to offensive inconsistencies. The addition of veteran Mike Conley Jr. and ISO scorer Bojan Bogdanovi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ć </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">address their one glaring concern and could make Utah a dark horse threat in a close Western Conference, especially if Donovan Mitchell can take that next step and play at an all-star level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 6 seed: Portland Trail Blazers</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portland was notorious as a team that did really well seeding wise but could never take that next step and convert regular-season success to playoff success. All of this changed when they made the Western Conference finals last year. They accomplished this feat without their third star Jusuf Nurki</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ć</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who suffered an injury late in the season leading up to the playoffs. So why are they seeded so low? They lost one of their key roleplayers Seth Curry in Free agency and its unlikely they get the same production from Rodney Hood going forward. Nurkic who was already a defensive liability has just taken a lower leg injury which won’t bode well defensively. The Trail Blazers 2 man duo of Lillard and McCollum can only carry this team so far on their own without a clear cut third option, and adding Hasan Whiteside who is little more than an elite rebounder does little to solve this problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7 seed: Golden State Warriors</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know what you’re saying, they made the finals the last 5 years straight how are they suddenly a 7 seed. Losing Kevin Durant is bad, especially since Klay Thompson is injured as well, but on top of this the Dubs lost backup guard Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, and Andre Iguodala. All of that and the only addition is D’angelo Russel. Yes Russel is an All Star, yes he is an exciting young player. But the fit next to Steph is frankly terrible. Both are defensive liabilities and D’angelo Russel is extremely pick and roll dependent while the Warriors run very little Pick and Roll and instead prefer a very fluid ball movement offense. Also what’s Russels fit when Klay comes back? Are Steph, Klay, and Russel going to be on the court together, if so that lineup will be extremely undersized especially compared to the rest of the Western Conference teams, which all have notable size to take advantage of smaller lineups. Furthermore the Raptors showed how easy it was to neutralize Curry when he was the sole offensive option with a Box and 1 Defense. In conclusion the warriors lost their best player to Free Agency as well as the little depth that they had to add a player who is ill fitting to their game plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8 seed: Sacramento Kings</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Kings have done a lot of things right in the last few years. They got rid of bad contracts and built a deep young team from the draft and brought in pieces to facilitate their young nucleus’ growth. They have stellar perimeter play from Bogdan Bogdonovic (not to be confused with Bojan Bogdonovic), Buddy Hield, and De’aaron Fox as well as a versatile and athletic front court with Marvin Bagley III and Dewane Dedmon. This team then resigns a talented young wing in Harrison Barnes and signs veteran perimeter defender Trevor Ariza – while also adding depth to the backcourt by adding Corey Joseph. This team was trending toward a playoff berth without all of their additions, but with their recent acquisitions the Kings are poised to take the next step while also allowing their young core enough freedom to continue their development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

But for Toronto Raptors’ superstar Kawhi Leonard, the past 10 months have been some of the most agonizing any NBA player has faced in the modern era. Forget 10 months; 10 days is all it took for the beloved San Antonio forward to have a fall from grace previously unseen in not just the NBA but the sports world altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decorated superstar had come into the 2016-17 season as a top candidate to win the MVP race. The face of the franchise, Tim Duncan, had announced his retirement the summer leading up to the season, thrusting Leonard into the forefront of Spurs basketball </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an organization synonymous with class and poise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season culminated with a Western Conference matchup against the Golden State Warriors, after dominating the Grizzlies and the Rockets 4-2 each. The fateful Game 1 in Oracle haunts Spurs fans to this very day. With a commanding 23-point lead in the third quarter, Leonard went up for a shot to add to his 26 points </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only to have Warriors center Zaza Pachulia make a dirty closeout leading to Leonard leaving the game. The 23-point lead the Spurs had built up to this point disintegrated and the Spurs would go on to get swept 4-0, with Leonard unable to play the rest of the series.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the plan was for Leonard to make his return after the preseason. However, his debut in the 2017-18 season was repeatedly pushed back until Dec. 12. He went on to play nine games that entire season, citing continued pain in his quadricep as preventing his return. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, here’s where everything takes a turn. Leonard was diagnosed with a quadriceps tendinopathy by the Spurs’ medicalstaff. Tendinopathy is essentially a catch-all term for any issue with a tendon from soreness to a tear to a degenerative disease. Leonard had been cleared for play repeatedly throughout the season by the Spurs’ medical team. However, due to lingering pain, he elected to get a second opinion and was then diagnosed with a quadriceps contusion, which is internal bleeding of the muscle susceptible to calcification. Leonards refusal to play despite being cleared by the team’s medical staff in favor of a second outside opinion caused tensions to arise within the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coaches and players started putting pressure on Leonard through the media, and the basketball world sided with them. At the time, very little to almost no information was known to the public. It is still unknown what the final diagnosis on the injury is to this day. In light of the lack of information, the media and fans sided with the Spurs, which had been a model of how a top-class organization should be run from top to bottom for almost 30 years until this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonard was vilified and ridiculed by the basketball world. Prominent media members like Skip Bayless accused Leonard of crumbling under the expectations of filling Tim Duncan’s shoes, while others began to question his character as a person altogether. A very clear divide had formed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one where it was Leonard versus the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unable to rebuild trust with the Spurs organization and fans, Leonard requested a trade. Leonard had two years under contract left and had expressed explicit interest in going to LA to continue to grow his brand and career. Knowing this, very few teams were willing to part with assets that matched the talents of a player as decorated as Leonard. I mean, a two-time defensive player of the year and Finals MVP doesn’t just come every draft </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they’re once-in-a-generation type players, but only getting such a player for one guaranteed year turned many teams away from making a deal with the Spurs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto Raptors General Manager (GM) Masai Ujiri is not your regular GM however and despite knowing all that he knew, he took a wild gamble. The Raptors had lost to LeBron for four straight years, even though they built their team to match up specifically against the Cavaliers. After yet another upsetting elimination at the hands of James, Ujiri pulled the trigger to trade their franchise star DeMar DeRozan and roleplayer Jakob Poeltl for Leonard and Danny Green. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto was ridiculed for taking such a gamble </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">giving up a young All-Star in return for a superstar who had played nine games the prior season due to injury and was set on moving to LA in the near future. Nonetheless Ujiri made the controversial move, which has paid off greatly this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Raptors effectively locked down the second seed, not just in the East but the NBA as a whole behind Milwaukee. After making quick work of the Orlando Magic in 5, the Raptors faced the 76ers who were widely thought to have the best starting five after the Wariors. This series went to Game 7, and with the game on the line, Leonard ripped the hearts out of every Philly fan by hitting a series-ending game winner over Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto found themselves matched up with the best team in the NBA: the Bucks. After going down 0-2, Toronto rallied behind Leonard  to pull out a win in double overtime. Toronto went on to win four straight after losing the first two games to get to where they are today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonard has come a long way from his initial fall from grace, and now stands on the verge of carrying the torch of best player in the world in the post-LeBron era to come in a few years. Now, he is less than seven games away from redefining not just his career but the NBA balance of power as a whole with the crucial 2019 free agency looming. But for now, NBA fans are all anticipating the redo of the matchup stolen from us by that injury two years ago.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Junior utility Sarah Snyder and senior utility Kate Pipkin have both put together statement seasons on the offensive side of the ball for the ‘Chos. Snyder ended her hat trick streak this past game. Pipkin has been a model of unparalleled consistency by putting up her third straight season with 40+ goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side of the ball UCSB’s goalies have been phenomenal this season, making an impact on every game that they check in for. In the most recent of these games senior goalie Kenzi Snyder posted an impressive 75% save percentage against LBSU.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The confidence and skills the upperclassmen bring to the water have trickled down into the underclassmen, who have all shown their own ability to compete at a high level despite having less experience than a lot of their competitors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This unique mix of upper and underclassmen playing top-of-the-pack defense and still packing a punch offensively is what makes the ‘Chos aim to go far in this year’s Big West Tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the team was not able to secure a first round bye with a win over Davis a few games prior, the added pressure has molded this UCSB team into a dynamic powerhouse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the strong play from UCSB, no team in the Big West Tournament should be taken lightly. It is imperative that the ‘Chos come out of the gates ready to go on both offense and defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of UCSB’s concerns going into not just this game but also to the Big West Tournament as a whole is to make sure to control the tempo of the game right from the start of the match all the way to the end. Many of the UCSB losses this season have occurred because of losing pace early and having to play catch-up after the half. With many qualified teams competing in this year’s tournament, taking an early deficit is ill advised and will likely lead to an untimely defeat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the bright side, all the ‘Chos need to do to be successful this weekend is play the way they played against LBSU. By controlling the tempo and initiating a patient yet efficient offense on top of a stifling defense, UCSB can definitely look to dominate the competition in this year’s tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara will ride their momentum from last Saturday’s win to April 26 when they replay LBSU, this time with some more added stakes at 1 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87757\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/no-4-ucsb-opens-up-big-west-tourney-against-no-5-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87757\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/no-4-ucsb-opens-up-big-west-tourney-against-no-5-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/no-4-ucsb-opens-up-big-west-tourney-against-no-5-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/no-4-ucsb-opens-up-big-west-tourney-against-no-5-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/no-4-ucsb-opens-up-big-west-tourney-against-no-5-lbsu/","id":4864,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[4863,4862,4861],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 11 UCSB Can’t Overcome Offensive Woes, Fall to No. 5 Hawai’i","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2019-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Unfortunately for UCSB, their red-hot offense was unable to break through against the Rainbow Wahine defense, as they were able to stifle the Gauchos for four straight quarters.

Despite the strong chemistry this team has shown thus far, they were outscored by three goals in the first period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">took a commanding 8-1 lead during the second period, fueled by Hawai’i’s goalkeeper Molly DiLalla who posted an impressive 85.7% save percentage. DiLalla has had a huge impact for the Rainbow Wahine, making it extremely difficult for opposing teams to find the back of the net. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming out of the half, the Gauchos started to gain their rhythm as they outscored Hawai’i 4-3 in the third period. Senior utility Kate Pipkin rallied the team behind a huge conversion on a penalty, jumpstarting the stagnant Gaucho offense. As one of the few seniors on the team, Pipkin has been instrumental with regards to her consistent leadership. This has allowed the Gauchos to stay resilient despite being behind by a couple of scores.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though UCSB came into the fourth period down 11-5, Santa Barbara put up a good fight, starting with Snyder as she notched her third hat trick in a row with two well-timed goals in the final period of play. The Gauchos could have cut into the lead further, but freshman attacker Amanda Legaspi was unable to convert on a late penalty. Although she was unable to convert, she will surely learn from these experiences, as the Big West Tournament comes closer. Despite this resurgence, the big lead Hawai’i had built in the first half proved insurmountable, leading to a 15-9 Gaucho defeat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this loss the Gauchos are 2-2 in conference play but will look to learn from their mistakes as they head toward the Big West Tourney. Although losing to the top seed in the Big West does not bode well, there are positives that can come from this loss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Chos found a way to get past the stifling defense of the Rainbow Wahine in the second half, which should give them confidence that they have figured out how to establish an offensive rhythm despite being matched up against tougher opponents. With players like Legaspi getting key minutes late in games despite being a freshman, it also shows that this team has much more depth than originally expected. With many young players playing big minutes for the team, the future of the squad is very bright. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB women’s water polo team will have their senior day in their final game this upcoming Saturday, April 20, against Long Beach State at home to wrap up the regular season. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87512\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/no-11-ucsb-cant-overcome-offensive-woes-fall-to-no-5-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87512\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/no-11-ucsb-cant-overcome-offensive-woes-fall-to-no-5-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/no-11-ucsb-cant-overcome-offensive-woes-fall-to-no-5-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/no-11-ucsb-cant-overcome-offensive-woes-fall-to-no-5-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/no-11-ucsb-cant-overcome-offensive-woes-fall-to-no-5-hawaii/","id":4861,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[4860,4859,4858],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/23"}},"__N_SSG":true}
