Waltz, who is the co-creator and head of the organization’s UCSB chapter, said that the club’s main focus is to run sales events that include guest speakers and panels. VSS also hosts instructional workshops and invites spokespeople from companies like Procore and Tesla, who speak to students about what it’s like to work in sales after college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the club offers a number of resources, Waltz explained that the program’s singular goal is to help “fellow Gauchos get a foot in the door in an increasingly competitive job market.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While interning for VSS this past summer, Waltz met the people who would soon work with him to bring his idea for the Collegiate Sales Certification (CSC) program to life. These other interns went on to set up CSC programs at their own schools too: UC Berkeley student Michael Williams became head of the UC Berkeley chapter, Shannon Chau, head of the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo chapter and JennaRae DeMaio, head of the San Diego State chapter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waltz said that he is adamant about making sure that all of the program’s events hold a purpose and provide helpful tools and information to students. But in terms of obstacles, exposure and consistency are big ones, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being that [this] is a new campus org … having that momentum is so key to really keeping a club going,” Waltz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coronavirus pandemic, however, has put a hold on the club’s meetings and workshops. To accommodate this change, Waltz said that he and his team are working to adapt the in-person workshops that were scheduled for spring into an online format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Waltz, the program functions on three main pillars: structuring an opportunity, salesforce certification and cold-calling tactics. The first focuses on creating sales opportunities, invoking responses and cadence structure — using language to convince customers to open up, creating an opportunity to make a sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second pillar entails creating a new contact and taking them all the way from new lead to opportunity and close. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third pillar is the cold-calling skill, where students practice nearly 200 cold calls to familiarize themselves with the process.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the program is designed for students to pick and choose what modules and workshops they want to complete, they “don’t have to do the entire thing,” Waltz said, adding that modular learning eliminates the hassle of having to sit through workshops that aren’t of interest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want this club to be something that can benefit the entirety of the UCSB student body. My vision [is to make] sure that us Gauchos are that much better prepared to go out into the real world and have that competitive edge,” Waltz said. </span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-92438\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long and Gh</span>ai have been able to manage a huge portion of the work by bringing their ideas to life themselves. Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir was founded by Kavitta Ghai ‘19 and Jordan Long, a third-year environmental science major who took a year off to launch the start-up to provide UCSB students with an alternative to Slack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack is an instant messaging platform generally used by large organizations for communication on the business level. Nectir, on the other hand, is a system based entirely on improving communication at the academic level between students and instructors. Nectir is actively being built into the GauchoSpace program as an add-on, giving teachers and students the option to use it in their class as a tool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ghai, Slack is “a communication platform that’s made for enterprise,” meaning it is structured to support business at a corporate level, whereas the two envisioned Nectir as a structure for communication in an academic environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While the idea of Slack is great, there are a lot of problems that make it unusable at schools. They don’t have data privacy for students … [and] it’s insanely expensive,” Ghai noted, adding that there are “a lot of technical problems” with Slack.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Ghai and Long spent two years developing an alternative: Nectir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last two years, the team has met with university administrators, professors, teaching assistants and students. The purpose of these meetings was to understand what problems these people are seeing and facing every day on campus at a communicative level — allowing the team to create real solutions to real problems, Ghai said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the first classes at UCSB to use the Nectir program was a workshop class in the Instructional Development department led by one of their instructional consultants, Mindy Colin. By adapting her class to the program, Ghai and Long were given the opportunity to see how Nectir would function in reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir was designed specifically to create lines of communication throughout an entire school, not just for one class or within one major. In order for students to use the program, professors must create a channel for their class — similar to those in Slack — that will be embedded in their class GauchoSpace site. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program had its soft launch in Fall Quarter 2019 and since then, Ghai and Long said that 15% of the people at UCSB have used or currently have access to a Nectir channel for a specific class. It is working so well that, according to Ghai, the team is in the process of signing a contract with the school for funding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team’s goal is that “every single student on campus should have Nectir regardless of whether their TA or professor decides to use it,” Ghai said, by Spring Quarter 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose behind Nectir is to solve this “position of frustration” that students feel when they transition from a 30-person class in high school to a 500-person college course, Long explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes days to figure out things, and you’re often alone in the library banging your head against the wall trying to figure something out,” Long said. “We don’t know how to fix it, we don’t know how to create a new educational system… but what we can do is use technology to connect people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ghai added that a bonus of the program is that it was created by students for students, as opposed to being created by tech companies who create academic tools without factoring in student perspectives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actual set-up of the Nectir program was designed in-house; Long manages all of the technical parts in-house and runs the servers himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long and Gh</span>ai have been able to manage a huge portion of the work by bringing their ideas to life themselves, allowing them to move very quickly through the developing process while not needing a significant amount of start-up money.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now that we’re starting to reach out to other schools, it will eventually be time to bring other people onto the team, but for right now, for everything we have done at UCSB, it has worked really well with just the two of us,” Ghai added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team plans to first completely integrate the system at UCSB before branching out and attempting to spread the program to other schools, such as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and other UC campuses.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [2/03/2020, 7:49 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Jordan Long is a second-year student.

He said that he attracted users over to the new subreddit by simply telling people on the current page to come transfer over, promising a better moderator presence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning, Boe worked in a team of three, including UCSB alumni u/beetling and u/Rlight. The team has worked hard to make the page “a place for inclusion” — where r/UCSantaBarbara members could come together and help one another, according to Boe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, however, that “place of inclusion” has grown substantially. In the last eight years, the number of submissions to the page has grown by nearly 500%, according to a post detailing the number of annual submissions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the page has become so popular that Boe and his team have found it hard to maintain the vast community on their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been rather amazing watching this subreddit grow from an initial 50 to the now nearly 14,000 subscribers. However, lately, we’ve noticed we spend more of our time moderating than we’d prefer,” Boe detailed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accommodate the page’s growth, Boe posted a callout to the Reddit community in November, encouraging UCSB students to apply to become a new moderator and work alongside the current group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the callout was posted, Boe announced in a later post that month that two new moderators, fourth-year pharmacology major u/thejappster and third-year biological science major u/swimming_legend, had been selected. Both new moderators asked to be referred to only by their usernames, citing privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boe said the two new moderators stood out in the selection process because they were some of the most active people on the page. Their post history met Boe’s and u/beetling’s standards for the position and they both appeared to be students who genuinely cared about the UCSB Reddit community, Boe added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/thejappster said he used the subreddit to help him navigate his time at UCSB — researching classes, asking for advice and staying up to date on news in the community. As a new moderator, he said his focus is on promoting healthy discussion on a wide variety of topics, like local events and what professors or classes to take, and to encourage people with different views to express their opinions, as long as they are not attacking each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can get tricky in stressful situations, such as when the Thomas Fire occurred near campus three years ago. The stress of the situation led to an influx of content and information that was difficult to aggregate, u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, u/thejappster said the subreddit was meaningful to him because of the people who engage with it since they are often students, alumni or people who just live in the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They really care about the subreddit and really care about helping people,” u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/swimming_legend joined the sub his first year at UCSB and said he hasn’t regretted it for a second. He said he uses the page for academic advice, social connections and a good laugh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although u/swimming_legend said he has not been a member of the Reddit page as long as the other moderators, he felt proud to have been “a member of a community that … has a positive impact on its members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said he is excited to implement new ideas for the page and create a more friendly and helpful experience for its users.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new moderator team has already hit the ground running; u/swimming_legend said they are working on a new way to improve the design of the page and make it more user-friendly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One important change that the team is working on, according to u/thejappster, is a way to consolidate all the posts about social groups — such as people who are looking for a group to hang out with in real life. That way people looking to make real friends or who are feeling lonely have a place to meet others in similar situations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the team’s main focus has been around establishing a syllabus bank, which officially launched on Jan. 5, according to an </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/ekf9et/syllabus_bank_new_for_winter_2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announcement on Reddit.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to u/thejappster, the bank is a resource where “users submit syllabi to an online database, like Google Drive and you post that link to the Reddit page.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current and forthcoming improvements to the Reddit page are not only for the benefit of the sub itself but also for the students’ lives, as they use the page as a resource for all things UCSB, Boe stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, having two current students as moderators will also help to better represent the current student perspective at UCSB, Boe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students are the ones who have the opportunity and the time to put into making the community better.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Correction [Jan. 17, 12:38 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Boe was the head moderator of r/UCSantaBarbara, that he maintained the page by himself and that the current team of moderators has three members. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article has been corrected to reflect that r/UCSantaBarbara has no official head moderator, that Boe did not maintain the page by himself and that the current team of moderators has four members. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quotation that contradicted Boe’s statement regarding the moderators’ ideas for the Reddit page has also been removed. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92006\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92006\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/","id":3351,"author":{"id":256,"name":"KJ Clay"},"related":[3350,3349,3348],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/256"}},"__N_SSG":true}
