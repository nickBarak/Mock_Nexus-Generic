Thousands of LED headlights were given out to attendees to promote rider visibility. <em>Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Campus and community organizations came together to host I.V. LUX, an event to promote bicycle safety, Wednesday at the Associated Students Pardall Center in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Host organizations included Associate Students Bike Committee (ASBC), Office of Student Affairs, the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Department, the Office of Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr and the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition. During the event, 1,500 LED bike lights were handed out on a first-come, first-served basis to local bikers, made possible by funds from ASBC and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>Tiffany Yeh, ASBC Administrative Coordinator and third-year mathematics major, said the LED light giveaway was part of the Bike Committee’s plan to improve UCSB bike culture.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to change the bike culture here in I.V. and on campus,” Yeh said. “More specifically, right now, because there are so many accidents at night, we are handing out lights. In conjunction with that, we are giving out a lot of bike safety information and tips.”</p>\n<p>Yeh said ASBC also hopes to improve UCSB’s standing in the League of American Bicyclists’ Annual Bicycle Friendly University awards program, which celebrates universities that have a positive bike culture.</p>\n<p>“The Bike Committee is focused on creating and maintaining bike paths on campus and worrying about bike safety on campus,” Yeh said. “With this event, we are trying to include in our mission an education portion in order to get a [League of American Bicyclists] platinum standing. Platinum ranking is one of our goals this year.”</p>\n<p>Stacy Kowsz, ASBC graduate student representative, said improving bike safety education in the community is one way UCSB can move from gold to platinum level in the League.</p>\n<p>“Currently, we are gold, we want to be platinum. Currently, only a couple universities are platinum, like Stanford and Davis,” Kowsz said. “One of the things we are lacking that the platinum universities have is better education and bike safety. We have tons of people using bikes which is awesome and we do have great bike infrastructure, bikes have a strong presence, but what we don’t have is great bike safety. One of our goals is to improve the culture and make it more safe.”</p>\n<p>Debbie Fleming, senior associate dean of student life, said although there are many problems with bike safety in “a lot of different spots,” bike lights are one step toward a safer bike culture.</p>\n<p>“We thought about what we could do that would be positive, so we combined resources with the A.S. Bike Committee and the Dean of Students office to put some funds together to get some bike lights,” Fleming said. “One of the easiest things for people to do is just put a light on your bike at night.”</p>\n<p>According to Community Resource Deputy James McKarrell, the current culture in I.V. is such that cyclists do not feel the need to follow the same laws as cars.<br>\n“A lot of people don’t understand that bicycles are vehicles, and when you’re riding a bicycle, you have to obey the same traffic laws as you would in a car,” McKarrell said. “A lot of the issues we see are people running stop signs and failing to yield to pedestrians. What happens then is we have traffic collisions, mostly either bicyclists-on-bicyclists or bicyclists-on-pedestrians.”</p>\n<p>McKarrell said there is a unique issue with the busy intersection at Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte, where there is currently a two-way stop sign.</p>\n<p>“The problem with that intersection is there’s free-flowing traffic going east and west and the people traveling north and south have to constantly wait. The bicyclists traveling east and west are within their rights,” McKarrell said. “The only thing I can suggest to be more safe is to not cut behind cars, to maintain a safe speed and to maintain awareness of their surroundings.”</p>\n<p>McKarrell said a possible way to improve safety at this locations could be to create a new traffic control device, such as a stoplight or additional stop signs.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be looking at the intersection at Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte, and we’re going to see if a traffic control device would help cut down on the amount of accidents and the amount of problems we have at that intersection,” Mckarrell said.</p>\n<p>According to McKarrell, although it may be the busiest intersection, Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte is not the most dangerous intersection in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Believe it or not, as busy as that intersection is, it’s not as problematic as Camino Pescadero and Pardall,” McKarrell said. “I think it’s because there are a lot of blind spots there, and, again, it comes down to people not obeying the traffic signs, and they’ll pull out in front of other bicyclists or cars.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, March 3, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/","id":4574,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4573,4572,4571],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CC Library Brings Resources to I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Library_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Library_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Library is sponsoring a librarian outreach service at the Isla Vista (I.V.)

Pardall Center to help SBCC students and I.V. community members receive library services close to home.</p>\n<p>The outreach program is designed to provide SBCC students who live in I.V. with easier access to the campus library’s resources. SBCC Mobile Librarian Kristen LaBonte will be available Wednesday nights in the Pardall Center from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. to provide locals with services such as research and homework assistance.</p>\n<p>LaBonte said she will be available to help students with a wide range of assistance services.</p>\n<p>“I help out with technology questions, research relating to term papers, personal research that people are doing, general questions and technical things like people’s personal devices,” LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>Although the program’s main objective is to provide resources for local SBCC students, LaBonte said she is happy to help anyone who stops by.</p>\n<p>“I help everyone. I don’t ask for anyone’s affiliation. That’s actually common practice with libraries,” LaBonte said. “We don’t discriminate; we are open to everybody.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Library Director Elizabeth Bowman explained the reasoning behind the new service.</p>\n<p>“So many of our students live in Isla Vista and struggle with bus availability or don’t have a car or, for whatever reason, want to stay here in I.V.,” Bowman said. “We do have online resources, which are great, but to have someone here for an extended time who can offer extensive help is invaluable. Students have told us that they like our library and our hours, but they like to stay here [in Isla Vista].”</p>\n<p>Ethan Bertrand, SBCC Associated Students Isla Vista community representative (IVCR), said the project is the result of collaboration with the Pardall Center and UCSB Associated Students leadership.</p>\n<p>“Within our student government last year, we saw a need for services in Isla Vista, so we created the IVCR position,” Bertrand said. “This is one of my roles with that, to work to support City College interests in the community and support students.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the news of the project’s launch has been well received.</p>\n<p>“So far we’ve heard a lot of great things. This originated due to feedback from students. This event is us saying we’re here and to please come use our services,” Bertrand said. “I think the greatest part about it is it’s not just for City College students, it’s also for the whole community, whether it’s UCSB students, longtime community members or families.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, SBCC trustee, said he helped coordinate the project by using the knowledge and connections he made as a former Associated Students (A.S.) President at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I coordinated this space. I was A.S. President, so I had connections and knowledge of Associated Students. So I brought both together, both my involvement with SBCC and my past involvement in A.S.,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he thinks the new service will serve I.V.’s SBCC population well and hopes it will expand to include more services for SBCC students in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great that we’re providing services for SBCC students. There are about 3,000 [SBCC] students living in I.V., and they do need services. SBCC is far and it’s not feasible for students to make it over there all the time,” Abboud said. “I hope that this, in the future, expands to include more than library services like transfer services and financial aid services.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on pages 1,7 in the Thursday, Friday 18, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Associate Professor of Sociology at Indiana University Dina Okamoto gave a lecture titled “Asian American Panethnicity and Shifting Ethnic Boundaries” Thursday at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) to discuss Asian-American identity throughout history.</p>\n<p>Okamoto spoke about Asian ethnic groups in the United States and how various social and cultural forces led to the creation of the panethnic Asian-American group, a term and identity used to describe Americans from all Asian backgrounds.</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, Asian ethnic groups in America did not organize to form a shared panethnic identity until 1968.</p>\n<p>“Before 1968, the legal identity of Asian Americans was divided, with representatives from China, Japan, Korea,” Okamoto said. “They didn’t form alliances — instead they formed their own separate ethnic communities with their own systems of social assistance and support, and at times they intentionally distinguished themselves from one another.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto also said there are a variety of differences between Asian ethnic groups, preventing the formation of a unified group prior to 1968. According to Okamoto, social, religious and economic factors contributed to separations between Asian immigrant groups in America.</p>\n<p>“They spoke different languages; they brought different cultural traditions with them from their homeland; they also practiced different religions. This is something that still happens today,” Okamoto said. “I would also argue that during this period different ethnic groups didn’t work together in the fields … because they arrived in successive waves to the United States. When one group fell out of favor, another group came to meet the labor demand.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, a new Asian-American identity formed in the 1960s when Asian-Americans sought involvement in the black power movement, the anti-war movement and protests at UC Berkeley and San Francisco State for ethnic studies programs.</p>\n<p>“Asian American students and community activists began to realize their unique position and perspective, and they created an identity that encompassed all Asian origin groups,” Okamoto said. “They rejected the label ‘oriental’ because it represented the European colonialist view and instead adopted the identity of Asian-American.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto said the creation of a panethnic group like Asian-American does not replace individual ethnic groups such as Chinese and Korean-Americans.</p>\n<p>“I argue that when panethnicity occurs — when ethnic backgrounds expand to other groups and an all encompassing identity — this doesn’t necessarily mean that boundaries have been displaced or attenuated,” Okamoto said. “Instead, the boundaries can have a layered quality where multiple identities can coexist and even be complimentary.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, the creation of panethnic groups allows immigrant groups to build new, powerful communities.</p>\n<p>“By trying to alter widely agreed-upon racial categories through organizing, Asian-Americans have attempted to change the meaning of these racial categories,” Okamoto said. “By doing this, immigrant groups can create new forms of community and identity and can call for shifts in the current distribution of resources.”</p>\n<p>MCC program director Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said Okamoto was invited to the MCC’s “Race Matters” series to emphasize a theme of intersectionality and bring a new perspective to the MCC.</p>\n<p>“The logic of the ‘Race Matters’ series is to bring a diverse group of academic experts working in various fields that intersect with race in one form or another,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “We wanted a representative from the Asian-American community to bring diversity and variance to the MCC, and Dina Okamoto’s work is very cutting edge, and she’s an incredible sociologist.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Arpan Singh said she enjoyed hearing about Asian-American involvement in the 1960s protest movement.</p>\n<p>“I liked how she explained the different perspectives in the protest movement,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Annie Hikido said issues of Asian American identity are especially relevant in California.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important, particularly in California, [which] does have an incredibly large Asian American population that is increasing both as a general race and as the ethnicities within it,” Hikido said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clinic Building to discuss Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) during the weekly stakeholders’ meeting.</p>\n<p>Williams proposed AB 3 in December to establish a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V., which, if passed, would tax residents using a Utility Users Tax (UUT) and would garner funds to improve public services in I.V., such as parking and lighting. UCSB Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow presented an update on the university’s position regarding the inclusion of the university in the CSD as outlined in AB 3. Local business owner Jay Freeman gave an hour-and-a hal- presentation on pressing issues in I.V., past attempts to incorporate I.V. into Goleta and Goleta’s cityhood process.</p>\n<p>Freeman said stakeholders should consider going through the LAFCO process to assess whether or not I.V. could become a CSD.</p>\n<p>Thurlow said UCSB is not opposed to a CSD, but does not want the university to be included within I.V.’s boundaries because of the unknown precedent it may set for the UC system.</p>\n<p>“The University of California has communicated with Assemblymember Williams’ office that, at this point, the university should not be in,” Thurlow said. “This does not mean we are opposed to AB 3, this does not mean we are opposed to self-government or any other measures, but because of the nature of what AB 3 is … nobody knows the implications.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, I.V.’s problems such as parking and lighting will not be immediately solved by the establishment of a CSD, as some students may believe.</p>\n<p>“The issues here just kind of stay, and I think it’s something we don’t spend enough time talking about, which is kind of the difference in mindset between students,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said there have been previous efforts to divert I.V. celebrations, such as Halloween, into more structured events.</p>\n<p>“In 2003 we actually had Dia de Los Muertos celebrations on October 31,” Freeman said. “I think it’s interesting that we were already having events on Halloween.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said the current LAFCO board should not be judged based on decisions made by boards in previous years since its members change every year.</p>\n<p>“If you really think that LAFCO in 2001 was a horrible, horrible thing, they’ve replaced their staff, and now have internal staff they don’t contract out anymore,” Freeman said. “All of the commissioners except these two, one of whom is in the room [Craig Geiser] and has been very friendly to us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63834\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/stakeholders-discuss-misconceptions-university-involvement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63834\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/stakeholders-discuss-misconceptions-university-involvement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/stakeholders-discuss-misconceptions-university-involvement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/stakeholders-discuss-misconceptions-university-involvement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/stakeholders-discuss-misconceptions-university-involvement/","id":4676,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4675,4674,4673],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Last A.S.

Legal Code, which states campus organizations’ leftover funds not approved for rollover to the next fiscal year will move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee for allocation to related causes. Senate also considered fourteen campus organizations’ requests to roll remaining funding into next year’s accounts, approving ten and denying four.</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and second-year CCS physics major Liam Stanton said he opposed the bill because he feels A.S. should use funding not approved for rollover to secure its own budget, rather than be forced to use it on related causes through the A.S. Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p>“If we did [not pass the bill] we’d have tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes hundreds of thousands, extra and we wouldn’t have to tread water partially every year like we do,” Stanton said. “Anyone in part of A.S. that needed more money could request it and we’d be much more flexible.”</p>\n<p>College of Engineering Collegiate Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothschild said he was concerned the bill does not say what would happen if funds move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee and remain unused.</p>\n<p>“I think there are some holes, specifically when these go into a specific fund for Finance Board; there is nothing saying what happens to them after the year ends,” Rothschild said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said the bill could prevent a “conflict of interest,” because A.S. will not have the option to use money denied for rollover.</p>\n<p>“It would be in our self-interest to deny rollovers, but with this we’re actually making sure that they’re put into Finance and Business,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>College of Letters and Sciences Collegiate Senator and third-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said there could be conflict over how A.S. Finance and Business Committee allocates funds that were denied for rollover.</p>\n<p>“I could see some groups that lost their rollover come and disagree with how the Finance and Business Committee used that money, whether or not that money was used for whatever students voted that money to go towards,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy said Senate should not easily approve campus organizations’ requests to roll over funding.</p>\n<p>“Students paid these fees for this year,” Guthy said. “We should not be setting the precedent of continuously rolling over funds, because students pay for funding this year and they need to go to students this year in services.”</p>\n<p>After much debate, senate tabled the bill indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Senate granted rollover requests to A.S. Media Center, A.S. Bike Committee, A.S. Department of Public Worms, A.S. Commission on Disability Equality, A.S. Food Bank Committee, Environmental Affairs Board, Zero Waste Committee, Take Back the Night, A.S. Office of the Controller and A.S. Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee.</p>\n<p>Campus organizations that were denied rollover requests were A.S. Elections Committee, The Bottom Line, A.S.

On Wednesday of last week, the California State Assembly Committee on Local Government voted 6-1 to re-refer AB 3 to the Joint Committee on Fairs, Allocation and Classification, the first in a long series of steps towards the bill’s passage through the state legislature.</p>\n<p>Community organizer with Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said AB 3 will now go to the Assembly Appropriations Committee to request the State cover the cost of a county-level election to approve of the potential CSD.</p>\n<p>“Since the state is requiring the county put it on the ballot, that’s a state mandate so now it has to go to appropriations and we have to figure out if the state is going to reimburse the county for the cost of the elections,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>Elliott said UCSB is currently included within the boundaries of the proposed CSD, though the university’s involvement in the CSD remains unclear. UCSB administration as well as the UC Office of the President (UCOP) have expressed concern about participating in the CSD, according to Elliott.</p>\n<p>“The university has concerns about being in the district and it’s been picked up by UCOP,” Elliott said. “They had a meeting in Sacramento with Das where they said they were concerned about being in the district. We’re trying to set up a meeting with the chancellor and some of his team with Das to kind of negotiate that and get what their concerns are and potential solutions.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District board member Jacob Lebell said he is in favor of both university and county representation on the CSD board. Presently, AB 3 calls for a seven member board — five of whom are to be elected with two standing positions, one for UCSB and one for Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we would be doing would involve the university and the county and bringing them into the process for it would greatly increase the ease of collaboration and help us to navigate both institutions as well,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>Lebell said he would prefer the university representative be elected by the Academic Senate which has multiple people, rather than by the Chancellor alone, as the bill language currently states.</p>\n<p>“I just like the idea of having the appointed person maybe be appointed by the Academic Senate,” Lebell said. “I feel like I would trust that person to be look from the university’s perspective, but whose loyalty would be to I.V. and not looking to simply represent the chancellor’s office. It would make it more of a democratic process to elect that position, having a body instead of one person able to appoint.”</p>\n<p>In discussions regarding the extent to which the university and county standing positions should participate in decision making, UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) psychologist Jeremy Roark said the standing positions could serve as board members who advise but do not vote.</p>\n<p>“I wonder if it’s possible to outline the appointed positions in a way in which perhaps they are voting for some things but not all things,” Roark said. “Maybe there are certain things we are okay with them voting on but others we are not.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said her main focus is to ensure the two appointed board members are well-informed about I.V., regardless of whether they vote or not.</p>\n<p>“I’m not attached to them having voting powers, but what I did like about having those two seats is that I looked at those as two seats that would serve out all four years,” Soutar said. “So for me I thought, especially if they’re going to be staggered, there will always be someone who knows the conversations that have happened in the past four years.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said he agrees with Soutar that the university and county-appointed board members should be knowledgeable about I.V.’s history in order to contribute to informed discussions before decisions are made.</p>\n<p>“I think their role is very much to be that continuity or to say, ‘This happened before,’ or, ‘You should consider this,’” Minoiefar said. “And they need to be there at all of the discussions and need not take part in the vote, but they need to be there.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63615\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63615\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/stakeholders-discuss-representation/","id":4674,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4673,4672,4671],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Groups Dedicate Memorial Garden","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-3-e1431986874217.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-3-e1431986874217.jpg?resize=600%2C401&ssl=1","description":"On Saturday, the Isla Vista Recreation & Park District and Project I.V.

Love held the I.V. Love and Remembrance Garden dedication ceremony for the six victims of the events of May 23 last year at a ceremony in the newly planted garden at People’s Park.</p>\n<p>UCSB administrators, students and Associated Students, county officials and representatives from participating organizations, such as Woodstock’s Pizza, Santa Barbara Forge + Iron and Seaborn Designs spoke at the event, officially opening the newly renovated park. The previous weekend, volunteers planted saplings and constructed a walking path through People’s Park around six benches with unique patterns representing the interests of each victim of the May 23 tragedy. Project I.V. Love founder and UCSB alumnus Jordan Killebrew, fourth-year art major Caila Baltas and fourth-year art major Jonathan Holcomb designed the benches and were present at the dedication.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said the garden is a “healing” place for the community to reflect on their memories of the victims.</p>\n<p>“This is a place where I think all of us can … sit here and connect with those precious lives, our friends, our fellow students who left us way too soon in their lives,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Killebrew said while the idea for the garden initially stemmed from his feelings of hopelessness following the tragedy, he appreciates the ability to honor the victims through the project.</p>\n<p>“It was way too close to home for me,” Killebrew said. “A year ago I would never have imagined this would happen and I’m just so happy that I have the opportunity to do something for the victims that we lost.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the circular design of the benches represents unity and “togetherness.”</p>\n<p>“The curves on the benches, if we were to put them in a circle, they form a perfect circle and the unity of those six students and imagining that for me is very, very comforting and very healing,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Sam Spinner said he believes the memorial garden will have a lasting, positive impact on the community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great,” Spinner said. “I think we really needed something memorable for the next students to come here and realize how big of an impact this event made on us. It’s beautiful and all the benches are amazing.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year theater and film &amp; media studies double major Kirsten Nygaard said the garden is an important step towards the regrowth of I.V. after the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really wonderful that they were able to create something for the community to heal and to grow and to remember life and love,” Nygaard said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said I.V. is stronger and more united than she has ever seen it in her time as supervisor.</p>\n<p>“I am always proud to represent Isla Vista,” Farr said. “But in the seven years I have represented this community I have never been prouder of Isla Vista than I am at this moment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/","id":4677,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4676,4675,4674],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate met Wednesday night in the UCen’s Flying “A” Room for their weekly senate meeting.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate discussed budget reallocations, A.S. Commission on Student Well-Being (COSWB) funding, Monday’s domestic disturbance and the search for a new Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>A.S. Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said due to lack of time left this quarter, he would like to override the legal code and pass a bill that would allow the transfer of $10,000 earmarked for “Professional Development” from the A.S. budget to senate unallocated funds.</p>\n<p>“The process is usually [as follows:] I would have to present the idea two weeks out from the time it needs to be done, and that would have to be ratified by Business and Finance by 50 percent plus one,” Theus said. “Because it’s Week Seven that’s not really going to work so I will need you all to essentially override the legal code and approve that.”</p>\n<p>Theus said Professional Development money went untouched by A.S. this year because it was not needed and could be put to better use by the senate to fund events and groups.</p>\n<p>“I think if there was a need for it, it would have been used, but I don’t think there is a need for it in Associated Students,” Theus said. “I know groups that it could help out a lot internally at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate passed the bill authorizing the transfer of the funds that Senate allocated.</p>\n<p>A.S. President said she was pleased with the student government’s prompt communication with the student body following the May 11 Sabado Tarde incident in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We had a remarkably fast and thorough response because your executive officers were actually meeting at the time of the incident, so we were able to pull together a very quick response,” Guthy said. “I’m very proud of how we handled it. I actually got a lot of administrators and community members thanking students for their involvement, not just executive officers.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said the search committee for a new Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs is currently deliberating over two final candidates.</p>\n<p>“We have two finalist candidates for the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs position,” Guthy said. “As you all know, this is a very important position because, obviously, they interact the most with students and deal with student life and a lot of the issues that are pertinent to us.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs candidate Monroe Gordon will meet with student representatives on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“One of the candidates will be on campus tomorrow and he will be having a conversation with students starting at 2:30 in the Mosher Alumni House,” Guthy said. “I think a select group of students were invited to that, but, to my knowledge, it’s not a closed meeting.”</p>\n<p>According to Theus, students are not well enough informed about the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs search committee.</p>\n<p>“Students were not consulted ahead of time in designing the interaction that the candidate will have with students,” Theus said. “The current student meeting is private and invite-only.”</p>\n<p>Theus said students should have the opportunity to interact with candidates because the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs is meant to represent students.</p>\n<p>“There should be an open space where students can meet this person or persons,” Theus said. “This is a very important position for students and we’re sidelined. At least the students on the search committee should be able to observe the candidate while they meet with deans and admin to see how they are as an ally behind closed doors.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Mental Health Coordinator Alex Hill said he is concerned regarding inappropriate spending by COSWB beginning in 2013.</p>\n<p>“Essentially there is a history of inappropriate spending with student fees,” Hill said. “I think there’s some serious misuse of funds. They may not be intentional, but it’s occurring, and you can see it started in 2013.”</p>\n<p>Hill said, despite a $2,500 allocation to advertising, the money is not being used efficiently and COSWB has not been responsive to his inquires about inefficient funding. According to a document Hill shared with the senate, COSWB paid $6,000 for T-shirts and $295 for a tablecloth in the past year.</p>\n<p>“They’re essentially spending vast amounts of money on advertising without any actual function,” Hill said. “They are not providing the services they should be in comparison to the funds they have.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate then moved on to debate the legitimacy of the Bill to Outline a Procedure for the Review of the Executive Branch Expenditures, and whether the bill overstepped certain powers.</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said she supports the bill because it requires the executive branch to follow the same rules as other A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t overstep [of authority] because we’re not actually approving or disapproving … we’re just having [expenditures] reviewed,” Mancini said. “They would have to submit their minutes to us and their expenditures before they spend the money, like any other A.S. agency.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh said the bill is problematic because excessive control of the executive office would result in inefficient financial delegations.</p>\n<p>“From what I understand, I still see it as an overstep. They would have to wait for a whole week for us to approve their spending,” Moreh said. “As we know, things move really fast within the association.

Tech Rental, A.S. Bike Committee projects and possible contributions to the Davidson Library expansion and renovation.</p>\n<p>A.S. controller and fourth-year electrical engineering major Amir Khazaieli spoke to Senate about a proposed program to expand A.S.’s current i&gt;Clicker rental service into “A.S. Tech Rental,” which will loan students equipment such as calculators and phone and laptop chargers.</p>\n<p>“The i&gt;Clicker rental program pilot gave us much insight on this type of project,” Khazaieli said. “For Spring Quarter 2015, forty i&gt;Clickers were loaned out.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said A.S. Tech Rental will have a website to help students understand the program.</p>\n<p>“[It] will have all the listed items with a picture of the item next to it, the loan time limit, the loan price, the liability price, and if the item is currently in stock and available,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said the estimated prices for 24-hour rental start at $1 for scientific calculators and $5 for graphing calculators. Phone and laptop chargers will be free for four-hour periods. Depending on the item rented, rental periods will range between four hours to one full quarter.</p>\n<p>The estimated start-up cost of A.S. Tech Rental Program is $586.60 and A.S. is looking into reducing costs by purchasing used items from students, according to Khazaieli.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the things we would be looking to do with a grant potentially is to create traffic lights on Pardall that would be at the Embarcadero intersections to make them a lot safer and also just to slow down traffic. – A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair Patrick “Mac” Kennedy</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair and third-year history major Patrick “Mac” Kennedy updated Senate on the Committee’s plans for fall quarter.</p>\n<p>Kennedy said the Bike Committee is pursuing outside funding for projects, such as installing traffic lights on Pardall Rd.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we would be looking to do with a grant potentially is to create traffic lights on Pardall that would be at the Embarcadero intersections to make them a lot safer and also just to slow down traffic,” Kennedy said. “There are a lot of bad accidents there.”</p>\n<p>According to Kennedy, a second A.S. bike shop is under construction at the San Joaquin Apartments to better serve those living in off-campus, university-owned housing.</p>\n<p>“There’s already like 2,000 students who don’t have access to the bike shop,” Kennedy said. “There’s about to be 2,000 more with Sierra Madre and San Joaquin.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy also said the Committee wants to repave the bike path near Girvetz Hall and expand bike parking near the Life Sciences Building, Humanities and Social Sciences Building and Harold Frank Hall.</p>\n<p>Third-year biochemistry major Leah Johnson requested the Senate’s approval to receive $900 from Community Affairs Board (CAB) to cater a dinner sponsored by Camp Kesem, an organization that raises money for children of parents diagnosed with cancer.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassandra Mancini said Senate should honor CAB’s decision and approve the funding for Camp Kasem.</p>\n<p>“This is their first year on campus,” Mancini said. “CAB wanted to support them. CAB made the decision to fund them because they thought the organization and event was important. I think we should respect CAB’s decision and grant them the funds.”</p>\n<p>College of Engineering Collegiate Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothchild said the Camp Kesem should receive funding from CAB because of their initiative in seeking sponsorship.</p>\n<p>“They go out and actively seek sponsorship,” Rothschild said. “They’re a very strong organization. I support their cause wholeheartedly.”</p>\n<p>Senate approved the CAB’s funding Camp Kesem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some of the things that were brought up included … outfitting all UCPD police with body cams. – A.S. President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy, who spoke with UC President Janet Napolitano at the Council of Presidents last week, said she and Napolitano talked about addressing police misconduct.</p>\n<p>“Some of the things that were brought up included … outfitting all UCPD police with body cams,” Guthy said. “The President promised to do some research on the cost of that, as well as talking about mental health services.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, Napolitano will increase the student services fee to fund mental health programs.</p>\n<p>“She plans to increase the student services fee and have 50 percent of those funds allocated to mental health,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Senate gave Chief Financial Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus $950 to print 2,500 copies of the new Financial Resource Guide on recycled paper.</p>\n<p>College of Letters and Science Collegiate Senator and third-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said no unallocated funds are left.</p>\n<p>“We’ve exhausted our senate unallocated funds,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>New senate unallocated funds will be available when the new fiscal year begins in July.</p>\n<p>After approving the 2015-’16 budget, Senate had a $17,794.74 balance to reallocate. They granted the A.S. Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee $1,000 and moved the difference to unallocated.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63204\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63204\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/","id":2781,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2780,2779,2778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders’ Meeting Talks Taxes","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stakeholder_Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stakeholder_Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, students and county administrators gathered for the weekly stakeholders’ meeting Tuesday evening in the I.V.

Clinic building hosted by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office for continued discussions on Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3).</p>\n<p>During this week’s meeting, attendees discussed recent amendments to clarify how the Community Services District proposed by the bill will function if passed by the State Assembly. If AB 3 passes, a CSD would still require approval in a county-level vote.</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said if there is not adequate funding to support a financial feasibility study, it could delay the county-level approval process of AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Theoretically, say AB 3 is signed by the governor by October 11, then the County District Board of Supervisors would determine when to put it on the ballot,” Elliott said. “So, say we don’t have the financial feasibility study done by October 11, they will probably wait before they decide to put it on the ballot.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The district will not be able to operate until a Utility User’s Tax is passed to fund the district. – Community organizer from Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott</p></blockquote>\n<p>Elliott said a vote to implement a Utility User’s Tax (UUT), a tax as a percentage of utility bills, would follow approval of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“The district will not be able to operate until a Utility User’s Tax is passed to fund the district,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, the Assembly Committee on Local Government said William’s office should reintroduce AB 3 if the vote to establish a UUT does not pass.</p>\n<p>“If the tax passes with a two-thirds vote, the District becomes operational and will start providing services,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t pass, the committee recommended putting in a time frame to allow multiple attempts so they suggested ten years, because it’s a nice even number.”</p>\n<p>According to a presentation by Elliott, the CSD would be dissolved after ten years of inactivity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think if there was a way to mandate that the county interact with LAFCO during this process that puts it on the ballot maybe we can say that feasibility will be determined by so-and-so date by LAFCO. – Former A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>Former Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double-major Cameron Schunk said a CSD is the best available way to establish self-governance for I.V.</p>\n<p>“I have concerns about the idea of pursuing a host of alternatives through other channels, when we have a channel right here that seems to be rather unified and, in my opinion, very effective for a lot of good reasons,” Schunk said. “I really have to disagree with the sentiment that this district may not accomplish what we set out to do if the county put it into place.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), an organization which regulates the formation of local government entities, could participate in the CSD approval process through involvement in financial feasibility research.</p>\n<p>“I think if there was a way to mandate that the county interact with LAFCO during this process that puts it on the ballot maybe we can say that feasibility will be determined by so-and-so date by LAFCO,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he supports having separate county-level votes approving a CSD and UUT.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t put the tax in it will only be 50 plus one to pass. With the tax it’s two-thirds,” Abboud said. “I would agree that it shouldn’t be the same just so that it speeds up the process and makes it less complicated it for people.”</p>\n<p>Stakeholders will continue discussion on AB 3 amendments at the I.V. clinic next Tuesday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63109\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63109\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/","id":4701,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4700,4699,4698],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Meeting Discusses Term Lengths","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stakeholder_Alexander-Payne-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stakeholder_Alexander-Payne-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, county representatives and UC Santa Barbara Associated Students met Tuesday night in the I.V.

Stakeholders also continued the discussion from previous weeks on how to set official boundaries for I.V. as a CSD and several attendees expressed preference for including UCSB buildings, such as university-owned apartments and residence halls, within the boundaries of the proposal.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator and second-year history of public policy Paola Dela Cruz said setting a two-year term candidacy for board members would allow more students to run for a position on the board.</p>\n<p>“Just looking at the students who have run for Park District, I think most of them are not first years,” Dela Cruz said.  “Generally it’s second years or third years so that by the time they graduate they have either two or three years on the board. Personally, I think having a two-year position makes it easier.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez said he agrees a two-year term would be suitable, and board members who wish to serve longer could run for consecutive terms.</p>\n<p>“I would probably not run for something that was four years if I was only planning on staying in for two years,” Lopez said. “Couldn’t you just run again for re-election if you wanted to stay another two years?”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk, the two-year position was suggested to address the concern that student board members lack dedication and knowledge.</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve been pretty clear that the goal of that position is to avoid student transiency,” Schunk said. “Let’s address the elephant in the room: we’re worried students won’t be educated enough and informed enough to make decisions on the board.”</p>\n<p>While Schunk said one potential way to develop board members’ experience would be to establish a year-long trial period, during which time their votes will not count towards decisions being made by the board, the proposal was voted down by attendees.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how this works as far as constitutionality or whether it’s legal,” Schunk said. “We could say you have a year where you can’t vote but you are still expected to show up because you are a member of the board.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, including UCSB in the official boundaries of the proposed CSD would pressure the university to make a decision regarding their involvement in I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“To me, including them in the boundaries makes it really clear,” Schunk said. “They can either say they don’t want to be in these boundaries and we can ask them why they don’t want to, or they can say they do and we can come back as a group and ask if we want to let them in.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said she does not feel comfortable allowing short-term residents living in UCSB-owned properties to have representation in I.V. governance.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want people who have not lived in Isla Vista to be making decisions about things that happen out here that they don’t have first-hand knowledge of yet,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p>Because of time constraints, stakeholders made no decision concerning CSD boundaries and chose to continue the discussion at a later meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/","id":2805,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2804,2803,2802],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Covers Deltopia Stats, Food Bank, UCen","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Paris-Cullen-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Paris-Cullen-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Associated Students Senate met last night in the UCen’s Flying “A” Room to discuss Deltopia crime statistics, A.S.

Food Bank funding and events to commemorate the anniversary of the May 23rd tragedy.</p>\n<p>During yesterday’s meeting Senators passed a “Bill to Re-Envision the Role of the Internal Vice President” and sent “A Resolution to Support the Mental Health Services Act,” “A Bill to Update Policy 37 Media and Publicity,” “A Bill to Define the Special Elections Process for Spring 2015,” “A Resolution in Support of A.S. Food Bank as a Food Center” and “A Bill to Update the Eligibility of EOP Grants” for review by the University Affairs Committee.  The senators also introduced several administrative bills and resolutions regarding A.S. Legal Code, sending them to committee for review.</p>\n<p>UCPD Lt. Mark Signa updated the senators on Deltopia crime statistics and said there were 206 citations issued and 145 arrests made during the festivities. Thirty-five of those arrested were UCSB students, 15 were SBCC students and 95 were unaffiliated with either school.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, although the number of arrests was “moderately high,” a reduction in medical emergencies and violence proved to be a positive change from last year’s Deltopia. Signa said the success of this year’s Deltopia occurred due to the concerted effort of students and community members to host alternative events and keep it local.</p>\n<p>“The only thing I contribute success to is actually not law enforcement, but student efforts and the community and people coming together to make this a successful event,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa also said UCPD aims to reduce the number of officers deployed during Deltopia in the future, but that any reduction would be based on circumstances.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s the general goal of all of this: to reduce the number of officers,” Signa said. “This year we had about 220 officers throughout the day … I think that’s definitely something we can look into reducing.”</p>\n<p>Zach Goulhiane, UCen Governance Board member, Senator and third-year chemistry and political science double major, told the Senate that Kaplan Inc.’s lease on their space in the UCen is ending soon and UCen administrators are weighing their options for how to use the space.</p>\n<p>“Their contract ends in October 2016 so they’re trying to decide whether to use that space as still Kaplan or have someone else rent that spot,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank Student Chair Katie Freeze, Vice Chair Erick Lankey and Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen  gave a presentation to the Senate to encourage the Senate to pass “A Resolution in Support of the AS Food Bank as a Food Center,” which seeks funding to expand the Food Bank’s services.</p>\n<p>“The idea we came up with is expansion of educational programs, such as conference outreach,” Freeze said. “And ideally we want a community food center and a demonstrations kitchen where students can go if they don’t have access to a kitchen.”</p>\n<p>According to Lankey, the campus’ grant of $75,000 for the A.S. Food Bank from UC Global Food Initiative and UC Office of the President (UCOP) ends in 2016, and the organization’s fee initiative ends in 2017. Thus, to continue servicing the volume of students that use the Food Bank, the organization will need additional funding, Lankey said.</p>\n<p>“We are going to need additional funding, ideally from the campus, to give us a base of $150,000,” Lankey said. “The idea is that we have $75,000 from lock-in and then a match of $75,000 to be provided.”</p>\n<p>Lankey said the food bank currently services about 2,500 students and is projected to serve 3,000 students by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>According to Freeze, receiving additional funding will help the food bank improve their services and thus work toward their goal to reduce the number of food bank-reliant students.</p>\n<p>“We’ll be able to provide higher quality food for our students in the long run,” Freeze said. “More culturally-appropriate food at our bank as well.”</p>\n<p>Freeze also said the A.S. Food Bank is collaborating with other campus organizations for the Edible Campus Project, an endeavor started by alumnus and musician Jack Johnson and his wife Kim that aims to eliminate local food insecurity, co-led by the Food Bank, the A.S. Department of Public Worms and UCSB Sustainability.</p>\n<p>“Another thing we’re looking to do is to increase food production,” Freeze said. “We are in partnership with the Department of Worms and UC Sustainability to start on-campus gardens.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Community Adviser Diana Collins Puente discussed the upcoming two-week campaign for the anniversary of the May 23rd Isla Vista tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Many efforts are underway at UCSB and Isla Vista to commemorate the anniversary and give the community the spaces in which to come together in healing,” Puente said.</p>\n<p>Events will include a candle light vigil, a march to Del Playa, a paddle out held by the Surf Club, the opening of Isla Vista’s Love and Remembrance Garden and the lighting project, amongst others.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/","id":2800,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2799,2798,2797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic Building to discuss funding an independent financial feasibility study that would break down the costs of pursuing different forms of governance, including a Community Services District (CSD), cityhood and a Municipal Advisory Council. The Fund for Santa Barbara, a nonprofit organization that supports grassroots organizations in Santa Barbara county, expressed interest in organizing the study using funds gathered from local groups and organizations.</p>\n<p>Interim Executive Director of the Fund for Santa Barbara Nancy Weiss said it would cost around $40,000 to conduct a feasibility study for a CSD, with an additional $16,000-$20,000 for cityhood and $10,000 for legal analysis of I.V.’s potential self-governance options. According to Weiss, approximately $32,000 has been committed by community organizations to support these costs.</p>\n<p>“There are a number of commitments that have been made either in writing or verbally for paying for the study,” Weiss said. “That includes individuals and some major entities like UCSB and City College.”</p>\n<p>Even with enough money, the financial feasibility study would still require several months of collecting and analyzing information to complete, according to Weiss.</p>\n<p>“By the time we press go, sign a contract and have it start, what I understand is two to three months will then be needed to gather all this data and crunch it,” Weiss said. “At this point I don’t even know when a start date will be.”</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, Community Organizer from the Office of Das Williams, said her existing relationships with local agencies can speed the data collection process.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the time it takes for the study is gathering information and reaching out to agencies and all that stuff to get numbers,” Elliott said. “Since I already have relationships with all those agencies, I have a lot of that information that I can send to them that will help speed it along.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud, online crowdfunding is another source of revenue that could help pay for the feasibility study.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said fundraising can be done through the I.V. Community Relations Committee as well.</p>\n<p>“We would probably be open to it,” Schunk said. “We could do micro-donations.”</p>\n<p>Participants plan to discuss the boundaries that could potentially be under the administration of a local government in I.V. at next week’s stakeholders’ meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-22/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-study-costs/","id":4723,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4722,4721,4720],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate in the Old Little Theater and Girvetz 1004, making speeches to the senators concerning the Students for Justice in Palestine’s recent resolution. <em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night in the Old Little Theater and then in Girvetz 1004 to discuss a resolution by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), sponsored by senators Xin Ma and Steven Kwok, which calls for the university to divest from businesses profiting from alleged human rights violations in Palestine.</p>\n<p>Dozens of students signed up to speak during public forum, giving passionate arguments both in support and in opposition of the resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC undergraduate campuses whose student governments have not yet passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in November 2012.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This resolution never took into account that boycotting businesses affects business decisions that hurt the Palestinians as much if not more than the Israeli economy. Hewlett-Packard, one of the companies on the boycott list, employees hundreds of Palestinians engineers and other people in the technology industry.” – Second-year economics and accounting major Michael Torbati</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sociology graduate student Emily Schneider said students should stand in opposition to the corporations profiting from human rights violations currently being committed via the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>“The problem there is not so much about religion, or other things that we see in the media, but the fact that there’s companies over there profiting off of the cycle of violence and we have the chance here as students to play a role in ending the cycle of violence for both Israelis and Palestinians,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>Daniel Lifton, president of Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi, said that the Palestinian Civil Society’s international call for a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has unreasonable demands that target Israel’s existence.</p>\n<p>“The demands that BDS calls for amount to the destruction of Israel it’s as simple as that,” Lifton said. “The generally agreed upon solution to this conflict is a peaceful two-state solution. I want peace; I want an Israeli state, and I want a Palestinian state.”</p>\n<p>First-year global studies major Marjan Abubu said he is in support of the resolution and called on Senate to stand up on behalf of people oppressed by corporations named in the resolution.</p>\n<p>“We have the power to voice our opinions therefore we must speak out for those who cannot,” Abubu said. “Our unified voices cry out to denounce corporations that profit from cruelty and brutality.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Michael Torbati said the resolution is an attack on Israel and may have unintended consequences.</p>\n<p>“Israeli existence is questioned daily. No other nation has to deal with the constant threat of annihilation from multiple fronts. It may not seem like it, but we are standing at one of these fronts right now,” Torbati said. “This resolution never took into account that boycotting businesses affects business decisions that hurt the Palestinians as much if not more than the Israeli economy. Hewlett-Packard, one of the companies on the boycott list, employees hundreds of Palestinians engineers and other people in the technology industry.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I saw most of you running for platforms advocating for campus and social change. You all stand at a crossroads of continuing a tradition of activism and social justice that is the very reason that many of you can sit at these seats today. – Second-year math major Alonso Martinez</p></blockquote>\n<p>First-year biology major Michelle May said if the resolution were passed, it would alienate the campus’s large Jewish student population.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has the largest Jewish population of any UC, therefore clearly the Jewish community feels comfortable being here and discussing that they are Jewish,” May said.</p>\n<p>“This resolution alienates the Jewish community. There is no reason to pass a resolution that diminishes the happiness of such a large student population.”</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Alonso Martinez encouraged the Senate to pass the divestment resolution near the end of public forum by putting the BDS movement into the historical context of past social justice struggles.</p>\n<p>“As George William, a German philosopher once said, ‘The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.’ Will you be the Senators that prove him wrong?” Martinez asked.</p>\n<p>Martinez said the opportunity to pass the divestment resolution was in the tradition of past student-initiated changes such as Black Student Union’s call for changes to the ethnic studies program to accurately reflect the UC demographic and protests against UC complicity with the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>“I saw most of you running for platforms advocating for campus and social change,” Martinez said. “You all stand at a crossroads of continuing a tradition of activism and social justice that is the very reason that many of you can sit at these seats today.”</p>\n<p>As of press time, no vote had been made on the resolution.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on the page 6 of Thursday, April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This is something we have been pushing for years because the county is continuing to underserve our community. – Paola Dela Cruz of the Open People’s Party (OPP)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Answering a question about Assemblymember Das Williams’ self-governance bill AB-3, Dela Cruz said she was a strong proponent of the legislation.</p>\n<p>“Since the very first day that Assembly Bill 3 was introduced, I have been part of the dialogues and meetings that have taken place in our local community,” Dela Cruz said. “I am in full support of this bill. I believe that our community needs self-governance in Isla Vista. This is something we have been pushing for years because the county is continuing to underserve our community.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, the structural changes outlined by AB-3 are not enough to incite change in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t do nearly enough,” Morse said. “I think that it’s a way to appease the students at this particular point in time. What we really need is representation, and the way that we get representation is through cityhood, not through the current structure.”</p>\n<p>In regard to addressing rape culture on campus, Dela Cruz said there have been a lack of programs to educate students about sexual violence at the university and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I will make sure that a yearlong sexual assault campaign is launched in Isla Vista because it is extremely disappointing that our university has never launched a sexual assault campaign,” Dela Cruz said. “I will make sure as the EVPLA I address this.”</p>\n<p>Morse said he wants to bring back the activism culture of I.V. in the ’60s and channel efforts toward anti-rape culture.</p>\n<p>“This used to be an activist community until the ’70s when Reagan came in and pretty much crushed that spirit,” Morse said. “I think that we should foster that activism spirit once again.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62393\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1877346452\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62405\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62393\" data-attachment-id=\"62393\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/charles-carlos-lopez-describes-how-ucs-are-unequally-financially-represented/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428970937\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"91\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"EVPSA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62393\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt='EVPSA Candidate Charles \"Carlos\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented.

The candidates for EVPSA answered questions which focused on advocating for students’ interests on the state level, discussing funding issues within the UC and collaboration with the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we work more closely with others working for the same goals as us across the state, we can be far more effective than when we meet just once a month for a board meeting. – Independent Candidate Mohsin Mirza</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mirza said he would work with existing lobby groups to pressure the state government to increase funding for the UC and push the UC system to slow growth spending.</p>\n<p>“I have been working within the association’s Lobby Corps and also in a number of clubs and OSL groups, and I feel like engaging with them will be one of the most important things I can do if elected,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Lopez said educating UC students and California residents is the best way to create change in the UC system.</p>\n<p>“I believe the most effective way we can fight back against cutbacks in our system and raises in tuition is to advocate for average students to know what’s going on, because when average students understand the systems that affect them and the ways that they affect them, their parents and friends will understand,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Referring to UCSA meetings, Mirza said A.S should be working with UCSA members throughout the year rather than once a month on issues facing higher education across the state.</p>\n<p>“If we work more closely with others working for the same goals as us across the state, we can be far more effective than when we meet just once a month for a board meeting,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Lopez said he would make an effort to involve students in UC Regents meetings and student conferences if elected to office.</p>\n<p>“If I am elected as EVPSA, every time that we go to a conference I am going to put a priority on students that have never been to one,” Lopez said. “When we have a critical mass of students who understand the issues that face them, that’s when we can advocate for real systematic change.”</p>\n<p>Debates for other A.S. positions will continue on Wednesday and Thursday in the Hub. Elections will take place April 20-23 on GOLD.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/","id":2828,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2827,2826,2825],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/147"}},"__N_SSG":true}
