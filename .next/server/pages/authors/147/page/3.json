Coalition and individual residents, students and academic staff. I.V. Coalition member and comparative literature graduate student Shari Sanders led the meeting, inviting participants to list “trials and triumphs” in I.V. history, including the creation of the I.V. Food Co-op, the I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), I.V. Elementary School and the maintenance of I.V.’s many parks. Other points of I.V history discussed included episodes of violence, sexual assault and what some alleged as the increasing presence gentrification in I.V.</p>\n<p>Last year, Chancellor Henry T. Yang established the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on I.V. in order to increase the university’s presence in the campus’s neighboring college town.</p>\n<p>According to physics professor Harry Nelson, who is also a member of the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on I.V., there could be problems facing the university if administration tries to intervene in the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“Spending money from the University of California, not just UCSB, but the entire University of California on a thing like Isla Vista is a very hard thing to do it turns out, at least with public money,” Nelson said. “Every time you think you have an idea, there’s a vetting process, and a consideration, until someone says, ‘You know, local government is the responsibility of something else in California’s organization, not universities.’”</p>\n<p>As a public university, UCSB faces regulatory and monetary issues that differentiate it from schools with different funding models, Nelson said.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is not a private institution. If we were Stanford it would be totally different,” Nelson said. “There’s totally fewer regulations and requirements. UCSB being public, we have a lot of extra responsibilities with public money.”</p>\n<p>Nelson also said there are a great deal of alumni who feel passionately about I.V. and could potentially contribute to improving it.</p>\n<p>“One thing that’s interesting about Isla Vista is that over the past 50 years, maybe 4,000 students have come through each year,” Nelson said. “You do the math, that’s 200,000 people out there, predominantly in California, who universally love Isla Vista. That’s a very interesting phenomenon that’s never been tapped into.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Constance Brown said she is concerned with the ever-growing population of youth in I.V., a trend that she said she has seen over the past several decades.</p>\n<p>“It’s an undercurrent that, if not corrected, I simply have no hope for I.V. And that is, we used to have some hundreds of mature adults living in single-family homes,” Brown said. “And they used to be maybe professionals, two people, families, but they were stable adults.”</p>\n<p>According to Brown, an older demographic of I.V. residents would balance out the “craziness” caused by the large population of youth in I.V., a phenomenon she alleges has steered I.V. “out of control.”</p>\n<p>“They’re [older residents] virtually gone. There are a handful of us left. But all of those family homes that were a buffer, that created stability, they’re all filled with young people,” Brown said. “You see really nothing but young people out there, and they’re crammed in. Once Isla Vista is wall-to-wall young people, I don’t see any hope for Isla Vista. You cannot contain that amount of young people, all they see is other young people. It’s like Lord of the Flies.”</p>\n<p>In addition, fourth-year global studies major and IVRPD Board of Directors member Jacob Lebell said parking congestion might create a climate detrimental to residents if I.V.’s population continues to increase.</p>\n<p>“I think what kind of gives people permission to act without rules in many ways is that with parking impacted how it is, a lot of I.V. has the feeling of a parking lot and I think that sets kind of the mindset and the environment that a lot of people are acting in,” Lebell said. “It’s a place to kind of put things. That isn’t community space.”</p>\n<p>The meeting was part of an ongoing conversation regarding the I.V. self-governance movement that began <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/\">last Spring</a>. Future meetings will continue to be held the third Thursday of every month in the I.V.

Farr also discussed the process currently underway attempting to establish a form of local government in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, after the terrible events of last year, the issue really came to the floor again,” Farr said. “Associated Students became interested in it, trustees became interested in it, and so I thought well if there’s this much support, then maybe it’s time to take a look at it and see if there’s a way to craft something that would be unique to Isla Vista that would best fit the needs of Isla Vista and provide more representation on a wide variety of issues.”</p>\n<p>California State Assembly Member for Santa Barbara Das Williams, an alumnus and I.V.-native, introduced a bill early in December into the California state legislature seeking to establish I.V. as a community services district (CSD), a form of local government allowing an unincorporated area to provide services for itself independent of county oversight.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the bill does not yet outline the specific brand of self-governance I.V. will potentially take on, but rather serves as a proclamation that can be amended when more concrete plans are established.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of a placeholder … after the series of meetings [Williams] is having are over with and the community has reached some consensus on what they want it to say, then he would amend the bill to include that in it and then it would start through the regular legislative process,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>While Farr said she commends the ongoing town hall meetings that have served as forums for students and I.V. residents to discuss forms of self-governance, Farr also said she is concerned that the expectations of Isla Vistans may not meet the reality of a local government once it is implemented.</p>\n<p>“I am supportive if the community can find some sort of consensus; I think my greatest concern is that a lot of people don’t understand what it could do and what it couldn’t do,” Farr said. “At the end of the day if something was formed I wouldn’t want people to be disappointed.”</p>\n<p>Farr said it is currently unclear exactly what a governing body in I.V. would look like, but said one possible scenario of self-governance could include a governing board made up of a variety of representatives from I.V. and the university.</p>\n<p>“I think people are looking for a body that sits locally,” Farr said. “I think in this case it might be some sort of board where there is representation from the county, the university, elected representatives from the community [and] some appointed property owners. I guess we’ll have to see what comes out of the discussions that Assembly Member Williams is having.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the creation of a local government in I.V. could also lead to the introduction of local taxes or fees that would help fund local services and projects.</p>\n<p>Farr also said one of the new services I.V. could benefit from is the introduction of a community resource officer, an individual “who could really be a full time, hands on liaison between the community and law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>Assembly Member Williams’s bill will be amended in the upcoming months to include detailed plans for I.V. self-governance as public discussions continue. The next town hall regarding the bill and its contents will be held Feb. 5 in a location in I.V. to be announced.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/","id":4793,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4792,4791,4790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

A.S. Executive Director Maricela Marquez also spoke briefly about concerns surrounding last November’s Mac DeMarco concert, during which police apprehended the artist after he climbed the rafters of The Hub.</p>\n<p>Marquez announced efforts to establish better communication between UC Police Department and the A.S. Program Board, which put on the concert, in order to prevent future mistakes on the part of security personnel including the chief of police for UCPD and Program Board officials.</p>\n<p>“We sent a general memo to all those personnel to see if we could do some cross-training about how things work and what impact one of our decisions make on others and so on and so forth,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy was present at the meeting to inform the Senate about a possible I.V. rebranding project and potential university-sponsored events to be held during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Guthy questioned whether a rebranding campaign is necessary and if money raised for such a campaign could be better spent on investing in certain I.V. programs.</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, I.V.S.A.F.E., a committee on I.V. safety led Santa Barbara District Attorney Joyce Dudley, is currently working on a rebranding initiative for I.V.</p>\n<p>“Today they proposed that this campaign would cost somewhere in the realm of $90,000 so they’re looking into where they would get those sources of funding,” Guthy said, “I expressed concern over whether students would rather see that money going toward actually creating programs to benefit I.V. rather than tell the world that it is better. So we’re not really sure where we will be going with that.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said university administration is examining potential alternative entertainment programming, similar to what was held during Halloween, for this year’s Deltopia, an event typically held the first weekend of Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>“The university has reserved a lot of campus venues like Harder Stadium and Campbell Hall for alternative programming that weekend and I think A.S. Program Board is looking into hosting some sort of concert or alternative event similar to Halloween,” Guthy said. “Nothing’s been set yet but plans have been developed.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said he encouraged off-campus senators to attend town hall meetings organized by California State Assemblyman for Santa Barbara Das Williams, to discuss efforts toward I.V. self-governance. Schunk also said the first of these meetings for Winter Quarter is scheduled to take place Feb. 5, followed by subsequent meetings on the Feb. 15 and March 5.</p>\n<p>Schunk also said he would like to see expanded service offering by the A.S. Pardall Center, including the purchase of its current building, which A.S. leases, to create a more permanent A.S. presence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would like to look into the idea of the Associated Students being able to increase and expand the services provided in the Pardall Center, specifically through an increase in fee initiative,” Schunk said. “One of the main things we would be looking to do is provide the opportunity for the Associated Students to also use that funding in the long term to perhaps purchase that building so that we no longer have to worry about renting that space.”</p>\n<p>The Senate also passed its only action item of the week, “A Resolution to Support Wage Equality Among UC Employees” without objection, which voices the Senate’s support for equal salaries for staff regardless of gender.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appears on page 4 of the Thursday, January 8, 2015 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59474\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59474\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/","id":2527,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2526,2525,2524],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Community Meets for Latest on Isla Vista Self-Governance","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Approximately 30 students, homeowners, administrative officials and members of local government gathered at the Isla Vista Clinic yesterday evening to discuss the future of I.V. and the options availa...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_59084\" style=\"width: 617px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59084\" data-attachment-id=\"59084\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/iv-self-governance-forum-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IV-Self-Governance-forum-by-Alex-Nagase_for-12.04.2014-2-of-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C910&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,910\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"The forum, which was held in the Isla Vista Clinic meeting room, was attended by around 30 people, who included locals, students, board members, alumni, and former AS officers.

The meeting was hosted by Santa Barbara Assemblymember Das Williams, who on Monday introduced a bill to the California State Assembly seeking to establish I.V. as a CSD through the legislature, rather than through Santa Barbara’s Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), the county entity responsible for overseeing changes to county and municipal governments.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, an elected body governing I.V. as an incorporated city could potentially alienate long-term residents who are not students.</p>\n<p>“If I could wave a magic wand, I would be for Isla Vista becoming a full-fledged municipal government with the powers and resources of a full-fledged municipal government,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>“However, I think the flaws of it is that the question of how long-term residents would effectively continue to have a political voice in a demographic where the population became a larger population of students over the years, that was never really effectively answered.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he does not currently support cityhood for I.V. because it would not be possible to provide the variety of I.V. residents with appropriate political representation.</p>\n<p>“I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not possible politically because of that basic question of, how do you balance representation to represent all of the Isla Vista community?” Williams said. “How do you represent the 7,000 … people who live here longer than four years at a time when the vast majority live here for a shorter duration?”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59083\" style=\"width: 431px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59083\" data-attachment-id=\"59083\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/iv-self-governance-forum/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IV-Self-Governance-forum-by-Alex-Nagase_for-12.04.2014-1-of-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1100&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1100\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Assemblyman Das Williams speaks in the Isla Vista self-governance forum.

You can do almost everything except land use policy.”</p>\n<p>Another potential policy that was discussed at the meeting was the implementation of a UUT — a form of tax levied on the consumption of utilities services, such as water, telephone and gas — specifically to raise revenues to fund additional services for I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Jay Freeman, an alumnus and local business owner, a utilities tax could provide the funds for better services for I.V. residents to the tune of roughly three million dollars.<br>\nFreeman said he suggests further research be conducted as to the effects a UUT would have on I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“That kind of balances the books with what we would be trying to do with a city,” Freeman said. “I’m really interested in the idea of maybe trying to construct a new financial study that instead of just looking at what we have looks at what we have combined with what we do.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr was skeptical about the logistics of implementing taxes in I.V. if it remains unincorporated as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult to carve out one part of the unincorporated area for something to apply to,” Farr said. “The Board of Supervisors could look at trying to put a UUT on the ballot but it would have to apply to county-wide in all of the unincorporated areas.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said the student body is not satisfied with the status quo regarding I.V. and would support the establishment of a stronger form of local government.</p>\n<p>“I think students are really on board with this movement,” Guthy said. “We’ve been having these conversations in summer and I think there were questions before about do we like the status quo? In the conversations I’ve just been having, speaking from a student perspective, is ‘No.’”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, students feel the current level of safety in I.V. is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>“Students feel unsafe walking just to their homes at night, you know, just walking from the library and that sense of insecurity in our own community is problematic,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>No decisions about the most suitable form of self-government were made at the meeting. However, it was stated that more roundtable meetings and public forums will be held at times and locations yet to be determined.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59080\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59080\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/","id":4800,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4799,4798,4797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The event involves male members of various Greek Life organizations competing for the title of Mr. Greek Universe. The event fell under scrutiny by some members of the finance board.</p>\n<p>The first objector to the re-allocation of funding for the event came from Senator Steven Kwok who raised the issue of whether or not the planned desserts were in line with A.S. regulations regarding the funding of sustainable food.</p>\n<p>“My issue with the desserts is that they are primarily going to spend it on brownies from Costco,” Kwok said. “That does not meet the Green Bill to the best of my knowledge, so I don’t think we should be funding that portion of the re-allocation. Fifty percent of the food that you buy has to be from sustainable sources.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nadia Blant said she took issue with the possible exclusivity of the event.</p>\n<p>“The only people allowed to compete are Greek so if they’re getting money, that seems unfair,” Blant said. “Is there any way that stipulates that any and all competitions have to be all inclusive?”</p>\n<p>Senator Casey Firenze disagreed with Blant and said that if an event is open to all students as spectators, that is enough to qualify it for student funding, regardless of whether or not event participation is inclusive or not.</p>\n<p>“I just want to say about the whole Greek system thing, I thought that we were in agreement that if anyone can come watch it, it’s fine,” Firenze said. “And anyone can come watch.”</p>\n<p>Blant contended and said that an event that is open is not necessarily open enough.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, just open to attend is not inclusive enough,” said Blant.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Jasmine Moses said she was personally offended by Blant’s suggestion to not fund events primarily targeting a Greek community audience because of her membership in Greek Life organizations.</p>\n<p>“The way in which you said [that Mr. Greek Universe should not be funded], it made me feel some type of way because I am in the Greek community,” Moses said.<br>\nAfter discussion, the Board passed a motion granting the re-allocation of $160 for food and desserts, but not for sashes or a crown.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the Chinese Students and Scholars Association requested $1,100 to hold a dating game show event in Corwin Pavilion. According to CSSA representatives, the matchmaking event would feature several singles answering questions about their relationship goals in front of an audience and being assigned potential dates.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Kherishma Shah did not approve of the event, questioning its value to the overall student population.</p>\n<p>“Personally I don’t see how this event would benefit UCSB in any way possible,” Shah said. It’s pretty much watching people, like, meet, that’s all it is.”<br>\nFinance Officer Jerel Constantino supported funding the CSSA’s event and said the Finance committee is responsible for financing events for a diverse range of students with different cultural backgrounds and entertainment preferences.</p>\n<p>“We all know this event is catered toward the international community, right? And I don’t know about you guys but my mom is from an East Asian country, this show is familiar to me,” Constantino said. “I think for us to tell [CSSA] this isn’t entertainment, that’s kind of ripping on their culture. It might not be fun for you, but it’s fun for the Chinese students who show up, who are also paying into student fees and who are also part of this community.”<br>\nThe Finance Board eventually approved $844 in funding for CSSA’s event.</p>\n<p>A Community Affairs Board request for $230 in re-allocation for buying toys for children living in Storke Family Housing and $1,850 funding request for toys for local children by the Sigma Chi Omega fraternity also sparked debate among the members of the committee.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Haley Ferrera proposed that both initiatives come with a stipulation that the funding be used for purchasing gender-neutral toys.<br>\nChief Finance Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus objected on the basis that if the committee required the stipulation, it would be overstepping its bounds as a purely financial organization.</p>\n<p>“I’m all down for gender-neutral toys, but I feel like a lot of our personal beliefs on things is kind of getting pushed on these groups and their organizations.

Thursday’s lecture was part of an ongoing lecture series presented by the SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind.</p>\n<p>According to Dweck, contrary to popular belief, psychological traits can be influenced experience and are not necessarily inherent.</p>\n<p>“To me, a hallmark of human nature is how much is not built-in,” Dweck said. “In fact, maybe what is built-in is the capacity to learn and grow according to the world we find ourselves in.”</p>\n<p>Dweck said determining the relative influences of genetics or the environment on individual psychology is a central question in her research on psychological functioning.</p>\n<p>“It matters whether people believe their qualities are built-in and fixed by nature or whether they believe their qualities can be developed through nurture through their own efforts,” Dweck said. “It matters across many different domains of functioning.”</p>\n<p>To support her statement, Dweck said the findings of a study her team performed on adolescents, which measured how their mindsets affected their academic performance, consisted of measuring whether students entering the seventh grade thought their intelligence was something fixed or something that could be developed.</p>\n<p>According to Dweck, results showed students entering with similar past intelligence levels received varying grades, showing that intelligence can be developed with the right student mindset.</p>\n<p>Another study Dweck conducted looked at the relationship or lack thereof between income and mindset of 168,000 tenth graders in Chile.</p>\n<p>“At every level of family income, the mindset made a difference,” Dweck said. “Students with fixed mindsets showing the lowest [test scores] and those with growth mindsets the highest. Mindsets had as much predictive value as any economic indicator.”</p>\n<p>According to Dweck, another study conducted involved two groups of students all with declining grades put through varying study methods and mentalities.</p>\n<p>“The control group got eight sessions of great study skills, skills the teachers said were really important,” Dweck said. “The other group got eight lessons of study skills with a growth mindset.”</p>\n<p>The students with better mindsets showed improvement in their grades, whereas students receiving better resources but a mindset of fixed intelligence continued to have falling grades, according to Dweck.</p>\n<p>Dweck said she also explored the impact of different kinds of praise upon children’s test performance and that praising improvement led to more progress as opposed to praising intellect.</p>\n<p>“We had a program where we administered different kinds of praise in an experimental situation, finding that praising intelligence backfired. It put kids into a fixed mindset and made them vulnerable,” Dweck said “whereas praising process and effort led to more of a growth mindset and resilience in the face of obstacles.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58036\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58036\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/","id":2966,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2965,2964,2963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Finance Committee Drops S.C.O.R.E Funding Freeze","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last night, the Associated Students Senate met in the UCen’s Flying A room to discuss a variety of issues and receive input from several community members.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58000\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58000\" data-attachment-id=\"58000\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/finance-board-seeks-to-freeze-s-c-o-r-e-s-fund/as-senate-subject-is-alex-santos-by-kenneth-song_for-11-05-2014-5887/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?fit=1200%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,714\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415227044\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate (subject is Alex Santos-) by Kenneth Song_for 11.05.2014-5887\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?fit=250%2C149&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?fit=888%2C528&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?resize=500%2C298\" alt=\"Senators discussed the issue of ratifying the Finance Board’s request to freeze S.C.O.R.E.’s funds.

If approved, all student delegates selected for the Student of Color Conference this weekend will not be allowed to attend. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Last night, the Associated Students Senate met in the UCen’s Flying A room to discuss a variety of issues and receive input from several community members.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of this week’s meeting was the potential freezing of the Student Commission on Racial Equality’s (S.C.O.R.E.) funds. The A.S. Finance and Business Committee has recommended that the Senate freeze S.C.O.R.E.’s assets “based on allegations that SCORE violated student government bylaws through their Student of Color Conference (SOCC) delegate selection process,” according to a statement released on S.C.O.R.E.’s Facebook page yesterday.</p>\n<p>No members of S.C.O.R.E. were present at last night’s meeting.</p>\n<p>During public forum, Senator Nikka Kurland spoke for A.S. President Ali Guthy saying the president opposed the freeze. Chief Financial Officer of the A.S. Finance and Business Committee Andre Theus requested the Senate not ratify the freeze approved by the committee on Monday.</p>\n<p>“I am recommending that you not ratify the freeze,” Theus said. “Just to explain why I thought the freeze should happen is just that there was a lot of discrepancies happening … I think that’s the best resolution to this issue.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nikka Kurland proposed a resolution to increase “financial transparency” in response to Senate confusion about S.C.O.R.E.’s funding process.</p>\n<p>“They seemed very confused on how their funding works,” Kurland said. “So all this resolution does is it stipulates that S.C.O.R.E. must present all of their financial actions to the finance and business committee and to be approved directly by the finance and business committee just for the remainder of the quarter.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Controller Amir Khazaieli spoke in favor of freezing S.C.O.R.E.’s funding based on the organization’s lack of disclosure about Student of Color Conference (SOCC) funding, a UC Student Association gathering to take place this weekend at UC Merced.</p>\n<p>“According to policies and procedures, everything that [Finance and Business Committee] funds has to be open to all students in some way, shape or form. Nothing is, as of now, transparent in regards to this issue,” Khazaieli said. “Students have no say in who’s running [S.C.O.R.E.], how much money is spent on SOCC, what the sources of funding are for SOCC and how members of the SOCC delegation are chosen.”</p>\n<p>As A.S. Controller, it is Khazaieli’s job to make sure student fees are being allocated properly and in accordance with A.S. bylaws. Khazaieli said S.C.O.R.E.’s leaders are currently spending student money improperly.</p>\n<p>“I have an inconclusive set of data at my disposal to figure out whether or not student fees are being spent properly,” Khazaieli said. “I have to deem [the data] an inconsistent use of student fees.”</p>\n<p>In its press release, S.C.O.R.E. maintains that its current process for selecting students to SOCC is fair and compliant with A.S. regulations.</p>\n<p>“SCORE stands by its selection processes and deeply condemns [Finance and Business Committee] for attempting to freeze all of SCORE’s funding, which is used to support organizations and events that promote issues of diversity and inclusion of students of color at UC Santa Barbara,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>Senator and A.S. Finance and Business Committee member Jimmy Villarreal spoke to the Senate to summarize the committee’s thought process behind the freeze recommendation.</p>\n<p>“When we asked the representatives from S.C.O.R.E. questions they weren’t always 100 percent able to answer them. I want you to know I do not think they misused funds on purpose at all,” Villarreal said. “Because the [Finance and Business Committee] wasn’t really able to decide one way or the other [whether or not funds were being misused], we recommended a freeze. There is an issue of communication between S.C.O.R.E. and the rest of the Association.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nadia Blant said the proposal was pointless to approve, and would only waste time.</p>\n<p>“I want to table it indefinitely because this whole thing is really tedious and unnecessary and it could stop a lot of things in the process that are unnecessary,” Blant said. “We shouldn’t be deciding anything right now, if anything we should be talking about it later but deciding something and sticking it on at the end of this bill that really doesn’t make any sense if you think about it, would be a waste of our time.”</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 15.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">The Senate decided to table the motion indefinitely and to take no further action.</span></p>\n<p>College of Letters &amp; Science Senator Zach Goulhiane initially proposed a resolution to extend the special elections deadline because midterm elections and midterm exams occurred during the same week.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point in us pretty much cancelling this out. We’re pretty much silencing people’s voices,” Goulhiane said. “Giving them this extra time just until Sunday allows them to actually be able to voice their opinions.”</p>\n<p>Goulhiane said that according to the A.S. Legal Code, a certain number of votes must be met during the elections and so far there has been a low voter turnout.</p>\n<p>“We had three percent on Tuesday, based off of what I just heard today,” Goulhiane said. “After a day we reached five percent.”</p>\n<p>According to Goulhiane, in order to pass the A.S. Legal Resource Center fee increase on the ballot at least 15 percent of the total students’ voter population have to vote yes on the referendum.</p>\n<p>In addition to the needed 15 percent of votes, the fee increase will only become valid with a “20 percent overall turnout,” according to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Erika Martinez said the A.S. Legal Resource Center has been campaigning for votes through outlets like University Announcements, Facebook and the <em>Daily Nexus</em>. According to Martinez, the Resource Center should not have been campaigning for votes since they did not submit a campaign bond, which would have ensured that a fee would be charged if they were to break campaigning rules.</p>\n<p>Martinez said the Senate is also to blame for the contradiction between the elections committee’s decision and the Senate’s decision regarding putting the bill on the ballot.</p>\n<p>“They as a committee voted not to have this put on to the ballot and then we, as Senate said ‘Yes, we should put this on the ballot,’” Martinez said. “So technically, this shouldn’t even be on the ballot, because this campaign bond was never submitted and we were all aware of it.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kevin Koo said Senators have a responsibility to ensure a fair and easy voting process.</p>\n<p>“As Senators, we’re also representing our student community,” Koo said. “People not having the opportunity to read the language in the ballot is, in my opinion, very wrong and unfair towards both the LRC and the candidates who are running.”</p>\n<p>The Senate discussed other options in reaching the required percentage of students needed to vote, but ultimately decided against the resolution to extend the special elections deadline.</p>\n<p>The Senate also approved a bill that outlines guidelines for publicizing conferences and retreats as well as clarified consequences for not attending these events.</p>\n<p><strong>[Correction:</strong> A previous version of this article and the headline incorrectly referred to A.S.

Senate meeting included debate on a bill that would change the responsibilities of the Student Advocate General, a visit from UCPD’s Lt. Mark Signa and a speaker on the place of art in Isla Vista. <em>Alex Yam/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night in the Flying A room in the UCen to discuss issues including the proposed “Bill to Re-Envision the Office of the Student Advocate General” and heard questions regarding police policies for this upcoming Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>The proposed “Bill to Re-Envision the Office of the Student Advocate General” seeks to create a new advocacy unit to deal with individual students’ needs, a service the SAG currently performs. UCSB Police Department Lt. Mark Signa also answered questions from senators about police policies in I.V. this Halloween, including restrictions on vehicle traffic.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year sociology and psychology double major and A.S. President Ali Guthy, the bill would remove the casework aspects of the work done by SAG.</p>\n<p>“The bill is a structural change,” Guthy said. “It has no effect on the SAG’s ability to select their staff, it just removes their casework component.”</p>\n<p>Guthy defended the proposal and cited the A.S. Legal Code as a reason for separating the casework and outreach responsibilities of the SAG.</p>\n<p>“The constitution does not demand that the SAG perform casework,” Guthy said. “They’re supposed to educate the student body on these resources, and then they’re also doing casework, which is not listed in the constitution.”</p>\n<p>Former Student Advocate General and third-year CCS literature major Bailey Loverin, who was elected last Spring and abdicated the position in early September, said that SAG workers’ viewpoints should be considered and discussed as well as the possible issues with forming a new advocacy unit. Loverin said those present lacked any experience in the position of SAG and raised concerns about maintaining confidentiality in the proposed new unit.</p>\n<p>“I think it is ridiculous that this is even being considered,” Loverin said. “Did you know that anyone entering that office [as SAG] has to sign a non-disclosure agreement worth half a million dollars to maintain confidentiality? That becomes a huge risk when you have a unit doing this. How are you going to maintain confidentiality?”</p>\n<p>The bill will be discussed further in future meetings and a senate vote has not yet been held.</p>\n<p>Signa was present at the senate meeting as a representative of the UCPD and discussed police policies for the upcoming Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>A.S. Off-Campus Senator Michelle Moreh asked whether or not identification would be required to enter I.V. this weekend.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen a sign near campus saying you may need to provide proof of residency to be able to come into Isla Vista during a certain time period…” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>Signa said no such policies would be in place this weekend. According to Signa, the only areas facing restrictions on vehicle traffic will be the 6500, 6700 and 6800 blocks of Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road.</p>\n<p>Signa also said the police strategy to maintain peace this weekend includes an effort to keep crowds moving to prevent tensions from rising and fights from breaking out.</p>\n<p>“The goal is not to go out there and write a lot of tickets. The goal is to keep the streets going and moving back and forth,” Signa said. “When the crowd stops there’s a serious concern there that the crowd will bunch up and when people get really crowded in there, they’ve been tense, they’ve been intoxicated, they get aggressive and fights start breaking out. That’s the same reason we don’t want cars on Del Playa.”</p>\n<p>According to Signa, he enjoys working in the community, although certain segments make his job more difficult.</p>\n<p>“I love working here, I love Isla Vista, I love the community, I love the university,” Signa said. “The struggle with Isla Vista is you have such a diverse population and I don’t want to point fingers at any group but City College unfortunately has a reputation of having a lot of kids there for partying. If that’s their only goal, it’s hard to change that.”</p>\n<p>Professor Kim Yasuda from the art dept. also spoke briefly to the senate about recent public art demonstrations in I.V. and the importance of developing I.V. as an artistic community.</p>\n<p>“I really feel like Isla Vista is ripe for a creative incubator where students could engage in projects,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>Yasuda said I.V. could be made safer not only by increasing security, but also increasing public art. As an example, Yasuda broached the possibility of public lighting in the form of art installations.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I want to say is enforcement is certainly important for safety, but there’s also engagement, and I think the arts could bring the engagement piece in partnership with the enforcement piece to bring a really safe environment,” Yasuda said. “Public lighting doesn’t have to be security lights or surveillance cameras; It can be beautiful, magical lighting.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Off-Campus Senator Xin Ma was also sworn in at the meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57692\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57692\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/","id":2995,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2994,2993,2992],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Questions Television Episode","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  NBC TV Network aired an episode of crime series “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” last Wednesday featuring alleged similarities to the Isla Vista tragedy that occurred last May.

The episode has sparked discussion among students, staff and Isla Vista residents about the alleged connection between the episode and what occurred in last May.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students President Ali Guthy, the episode’s similarity to the May 23 tragedy calls for community solidarity.</p>\n<p>“The most recent ‘Law &amp; Order SVU’ episode portrays a disturbing connection to the horrific events that darkened our UCSB community this past May 23rd,” Guthy said. “In times such as these, I would like to remind everyone to support one another, take care of one another and utilize the important services offered to the entire campus community.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said moving past the tragedy is something the community must do together.</p>\n<p>“This tragedy is not something we will move forward from easily,” Guthy said. “It will take time, patience and the love of one another and our community to become stronger and heal together.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major Nathan Silverglate said that because the episode was not in documentary form, it was not appropriate to air.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a little bit inappropriate for them to be making an episode on television about a large tragedy that’s not a documentary,” Silvergate said.</p>\n<p>However, Silverglate said he supports the First Amendment rights of the producers of “Law &amp; Order” as well as their right to make controversial material.</p>\n<p>“We do have freedom of speech in this country, so if that’s what they want to do, they can do it,” Silverglate said.</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies major Jordan Fabula said he supports the producers’ apparent inspiration from what happened in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a very smart idea. With his background and his actions, I think Elliot Rodger would make a great TV or movie villain,” Fabula said. “It’s just a TV show, people should not get offended just because they’re playing off of events that happened in real life.”</p>\n<p>Third-year actuarial science major Jonah Rockowitz said the actor was so similar to Elliot Rodger that he could not watch it past the two-minute mark.</p>\n<p>“I tried watching the episode and about two minutes in I was too creeped out because the actor did a good job portraying Elliot Rodger and I could not watch the rest of the episode,” Rockowitz said.</p>\n<p>According to Rockowitz, the episode’s evident similarity to the I.V. tragedy made it difficult to watch.</p>\n<p>“I think it was uncomfortable for me because I’m so close to the incident, whereas I watch other things that are close to other incidents that I’m not close to,” Rockowitz said. “I am okay that they made it because that is what TV shows do; however it was uncomfortable for me to watch.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/isla-vista-questions-television-episode/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/isla-vista-questions-television-episode/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/isla-vista-questions-television-episode/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/isla-vista-questions-television-episode/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/isla-vista-questions-television-episode/","id":4809,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4808,4807,4806],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/147"}},"__N_SSG":true}
