More than 10 years since the initial attack on the twin towers, I watched President Obama’s address to the nation confirming bin Laden’s death as my body was emotionally overwhelmed with shock, pride for my nation and a feeling that justice had been served. His death has avenged the roughly 3,000 that perished in the assault on our country and provided some closure to the families that suffered a loss and a city who felt vulnerable after the tragedies of 9/11.</p>\n<p>However, after the initial elation had withdrawn from my body, I was left with emptiness and harsh reality of the situation. Eliminating the leader of al-Qaeda has not and will not defeat the deep-rooted and extensive network of al-Qaeda. I believe the deceased leader will only be glorified as a martyr and will serve as a catalyst for more violence and attacks from the extremists who followed him. I think of it much like a starfish: You can sever every appendage, but it will always regenerate. America’s efforts to track and kill bin Laden have proved to be more of a trophy for bragging rights than a productive step toward eliminating terrorism. At the least, America has displayed to the world something that has been proven countless times before: Our nation holds an aggressive foreign policy with a very superior, efficient and violent military machine to achieve its objectives.</p>\n<p>The only concluding thoughts I have pulled from bin Laden’s assassination is that our nation and leaders have been fooled into thinking we as a country can erase terrorism from the world. By the mouths of officials and the talking heads in media, terror has been put into a neatly packaged and nicely labeled entity called al-Qaeda. Unfortunately, terror is far beyond an organization of extremists and its essence transcends the realm of tangibility. Rather, it is an idea and a philosophy which will be used forever by those who sense a polarity in ideals, culture and religion. As long as homogeneity exists within the world, there will be conflict and thus terrorism.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/","id":6200,"author":{"id":566,"name":"Cameron Jones"},"related":[6199,6198,6197],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/566"}},"__N_SSG":true}
