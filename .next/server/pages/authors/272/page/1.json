Both the decision to divest from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy were made under this policy, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the university and its stakeholders are much better served by investing in promising opportunities in the alternative energy field rather than gambling on oil and gas,” Richard Sherman, chair of the UC Board of Regents’ Investments Committee, said in the press release.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also noted in the press release that the journey to divestment took a significant step when the UC sold off its investments in coal and oil sands one year after the UC Investment Office adopted the ESG policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to concern from investors about the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on fossil fuel stock prices, Bachher said in the press release that the UC’s divestment represents an important turning point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we certainly could not have predicted the speed nor depth of the recent downturn in the traditional energy sector, signs point to a structural shift — not merely another cycle of boom or bust,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also said in the press release that the “lowered demand and oversupply” of fossil fuels “could portend an even longer price drought in oil and gas” as the world recovers from the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, the UC investments team is committed to growing its investments in sustainable practices such as renewable energy, waste conversion, sustainable agriculture and technology associated with these goals, the press release stated. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

I didn’t feel seen there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said he wanted to find a way for all students to have access to the outdoors regardless of economic, social and structural barriers, so he created Making Adventure Possible for All Students, known around campus as MAPAS. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MAPAS, established in November 2017, is a club dedicated to diversifying the outdoors and fostering stewardship for the environment, Gonzalez said. He founded the organization with the intention of creating a welcoming community and increasing opportunities for marginalized groups to experience outdoor adventures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdoor activities tend to be homogenous and exclude underrepresented groups, Gonzalez said. Outdoor gear is expensive and purchasing the equipment required to participate in adventures is not feasible for some students, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said he does not believe that the outdoor community intentionally excludes marginalized groups, but that there are structural factors that can limit access to these spaces, and it is important to recognize and address those factors.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People’s parents have to work, they don’t have access to the outdoors, maybe they live in cities,” Gonzalez pointed out. He also noted the lack of public transit to natural spaces, such as national parks, as a further limitation on who is able to visit those spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he acknowledged groups who aim to make adventuring more affordable for students, like UCSB Adventure Programs and Excursion Club, Gonzalez said MAPAS was created to address a deeper problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has really robust opportunities for adventure,” MAPAS Outdoors Chair and fifth-year psychology major Phoebe Rogers said. “At first glance, it’s easy to see the barrier just being a paywall, but it’s more than that for us. MAPAS is trying to carve a space where people of color and people from diverse backgrounds feel like the space was made for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea for an all-inclusive outdoor community club first came to Gonzalez from a surfing trip. While out on the water one morning, Gonzalez said an exchange student from Mexico paddled up to him and they immediately connected with one another through sharing tips and stories about surfing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He looked like me,” Gonzalez said. “I remember thinking, ‘Is this how everyone else feels? Is this how it always feels to have a community out here?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To hold onto that feeling and to encourage more diversity in the surfing community, Gonzalez had the idea to create a Latinx surfing team. But after a while, he decided he wanted the club to include all outdoor activities, not just surfing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to breaking the opportunity gap and diversifying the outdoors, Gonzalez said he wanted to bring people into the outdoors to foster greater environmental stewardship, further the conversation of environmental justice and raise awareness of the inequitable environmental burdens people of color and low-income communities experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I care about environmental issues. I’m in love with the outdoors; why wouldn’t I want to take care of it?” Gonzalez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After recruiting others who were passionate about this issue, Gonzalez said MAPAS secured funding from faculty and community members through a </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/mapas-20192020-fund?fbclid=IwAR3c5AlAFNXvwvO8n7IwuDGtpf9b3vsmwa5N073AtJ1BrWQ8q0V2mg0_nqY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GoFundMe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and applied for grants through the UCSB Healthy Campus Network. MAPAS uses these funds to purchase and rent outdoor gear, purchase food, campsites and permits, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, MAPAS has organized several hikes, kayaking trips, climbing events and volunteer restoration projects as well as a backpacking trip to Big Sur. MAPAS also hosts potlucks for its members to foster a sense of community and create opportunities for connection, which Rogers said is the ultimate goal of the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear to see what kind of community we are building, and how different that feels compared to other spaces on campus,” Rogers said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of our events feel really familial, and it’s different when you have an intention and a purpose coming together. There’s more of an energy to it,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Rogers said MAPAS has plans to continue with its “Demystifying Backpacking” workshop series to share information about backpacking. In the workshop, more experienced MAPAS members get together with first-time backpackers to break down and explain everything one needs to know about backpacking, from what gear to bring to how to purify water to what to do about going to the bathroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MAPAS also has plans to include professors in its trips to break down the “student-faculty ivory tower barrier,” Rogers said. By going on a hike with a professor, Gonzalez hopes that students can make connections with faculty outside of the classroom and learn about different research and academic opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez hopes MAPAS will be an inspiration for other UCs to create their own version of the club and eventually have a widespread community that encourages diversity in the outdoors across different campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MAPAS aims to address the lack of diversity in outdoor spaces and bring more people into the conversation,” Gonzalez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our intention is to be a launchpad,” Rogers said. “Our goal is for our members to build the skills so that they feel comfortable putting themselves into outdoor spaces and breaking down the barriers together so that those spaces don’t feel so intimidating and closed off.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92750\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92750\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/","id":3392,"author":{"id":272,"name":"Nadia Abushanab"},"related":[3391,3390,3389],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Your Home Becomes a Parking Violation: Large-Vehicle Restrictions Affect Isla Vistans","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"All oversized vehicles parked overnight are subject to a $50 minimum fine and possible removal.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For third-year sociology major Erin Joy, the chance to live in a van in Isla Vista was one they were looking forward to having.

Fischer said this policy affects a few streets in Santa Barbara, some in Goleta and every street in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students like Joy, it was a shock to learn they would not be able to park their oversized vehicles in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be disappointing if they started enforcing [the ordinance] in I.V. to kick out students and others who literally can’t afford rent, and live in a van by necessity,” Joy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the College Affordability Town Hall on Oct. 11 students asked Supervisor Joan Hartmann how the ordinance would affect students who live in their vehicles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [aren’t] students but tend to be other homeless adults,” she replied, explaining that the situation in 2013 – before the passing of the ordinance – saw a number of oversized vehicles parked in I.V. that were not owned by students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the issue of housing insecurity is not limited to non-student adults </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2017, the UC Global Food Initiative found that 5% of UC undergraduate and graduate students experienced housing insecurity at some point in their enrollment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average rent for an apartment in I.V. is $2,131, according to Rentcafe.com, a rental site which compiles rental market trends. Some students choose to opt out of paying high rent prices by living in vehicles like vans, RVs or busses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katelyn Wiese, a third-year Santa Barbara City College geology student, moved into a school bus earlier this year. She had been living in I.V. for several months, but since these signs have gone up, she said she no longer feels comfortable parking her bus in the neighborhood and now parks in different locations around Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now I can’t be in I.V. It’s not even an option for me,” she told the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCSB Sustainability Coordinator Katie Maynard, the UC system has launched a Rapid Rehousing program to address housing insecure and houseless students; UCSB now receives $415,000 a year to assist housing-insecure and houseless students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Financial Crisis Response Team can place eligible students who are currently houseless or about to become houseless in bridge housing within 24 to 48 hours, after which the team will work with the student to help them find stable housing moving forward,” Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the program can also provide “awards” to students to help if “they have difficulty paying rent and need financial support to stay in their current housing.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91253\" style=\"width: 318px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91253\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91253\" data-attachment-id=\"91253\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0317\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91253\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=308%2C410\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Nadia Abushanab</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for some, the decision to move into a vehicle may not be motivated by finances. Both Wiese and Joy said that while their decisions to move into their vehicles were partially due to the financial benefit of not paying rent, they also said they wanted to experience more freedom, be able to travel more easily and learn to live more simply. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Santa Barbara municipal code, all oversized vehicles parked overnight are subject to a $50 minimum fine and possible removal. However, Alissa Hazard, a traffic engineer for the County of Santa Barbara, said that vehicles have previously only been cited when an I.V. resident files a complaint with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Wiese’s school bus is oversized, she has not yet been cited or towed as of mid-October. She has, however, had multiple negative interactions with I.V. residents, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[A resident] yelled at me a couple of times … he [said], ‘If you’re not out of here by sunset, I’m calling the cops on you!’ … He said that us van-dwellers make the neighborhood a shithole,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has also had conflicts with the IVFP. “They would wake me up at 3, 4 a.m., banging on my door, shining lights in the windows, yelling at me to get out,” she recounted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fischer emphasized that the ordinance only restricts oversized vehicles </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as Wiese’s school bus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but not regular-sized vehicles. She encourages those who are living in oversized vehicles to enroll in the Safe Parking Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cassie Roach, a UCSB alumnae now working for the Safe Parking Program in Santa Barbara, the program is meant to not only provide immediate overnight safety, but also to connect houseless folks to other community resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We partner a lot with the food bank … we also have our own food bank once a month; we try and get people connected to free showers, making sure people are signed up for food stamps, have health insurance [and] are signed up for different subsidized-housing waiting lists,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach estimates that around 10% of their clients are students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wiese said that when she has been moved by police officers, they often referred her to the Safe Parking Program. However, she said the regulations of the program have stopped her from pursuing this option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not ideal for someone who has irregular schedules, who is either going to school or working. A lot of people who live in their vehicles are working and go to school. It’s not like they’re just sitting around all day,” Wiese said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach emphasized that the regulations of the Safe Parking Program are not meant to make people’s lives more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not meant to be this overbearing, strict program that’s going to have rules that they have to follow and just make life harder. It’s meant to be a supportive safe space for them, and we do want to work with all of our clients to see how we can best support them moving forward,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be a resource for students.
