In 2011 and 2015, UCSB received the less prestigious Gold-level distinction, according to the League. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amelia Neptune, a representative from the League of American Bicyclists, said in an email to the Nexus that there were “a few weaknesses” from UCSB’s 2015 application, which is why the university was not awarded a Platinum distinction before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[There was] </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the lack of bike share at the time (there was a program but it had five bikes total, as opposed to the 650-bike HOPR program that now exists) and the poor quality of many of the bike racks on campus, which have been upgraded or are still in the process of being upgraded and/or expanded,” Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The significant changes made over the last few years, including the addition of new biking paths and bike parking spots, led to UCSB achieving the new award, Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A major factor in UCSB earning Platinum this year [is] the outcomes they were able to show: 43% of students who live off campus use a bike to commute to campus, which is huge compared to what most schools see,” Neptune said. </span><b> </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the new improvements build upon the deep-rooted bike culture that has been present on campus for decades, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The presence of dedicated bike infrastructure, including 20,000 bike parking spots, 9 bike-only roundabouts, 3 bike-only underpasses, and the network of dedicated bike paths throughout the campus, [is] also a major factor [for the Platinum BFU designation].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamey Wagner, manager of the Transportation Alternatives Program, said that UC Santa Barbara began to develop its bicycle system in the 1960s, stating that the campus has “continued bicycle infrastructure innovation for over 50 years” and that the A.S. Bike Shop has been in operation for over 45 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wagner added that the HOPR Bike Share program, which launched at UCSB in 2018, has seen significant improvement since 2015, when UCSB was last assessed as a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most recent data shows that, with the addition of hundreds of shareable bikes, the HOPR program now has 1000 semi-regular users, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, in the last four years, the UCSB Sustainability Program has been partnering with the A.S. Bike Committee to provide bike safety training and bike-lot clearing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student initiatives played the largest role [in achieving platinum status], this was aided by the diversity in spaces such as the Associated Students Bike Committee and the A.S. Bike Shop</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Wagner explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neptune added that over the past year, the Sustainable Transportation Committee has been working on a master transportation plan for the campus, which includes improvements to bike infrastructure. This plan was included in UCSB’s application to become a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new bike plan promises changes and improvements to infrastructure on campus and in I.V., Mo Lovegreen, director of sustainability on campus, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are still in the process of drafting this plan and it will take us the bulk of this academic year to complete it but the idea is that it would help AS BIKES identify areas that need improvement and provide a list of items that need to be addressed,” Lovegreen explained in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan [looks] into the future and uses what has been thought of and creates what hasn’t been thought of.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

id=\"caption-attachment-90472\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One major focus of the event was the resilience of the native and indigenous communities.<em> Ida Kazerani/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the first year that the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) was responsible for planning this event. American Indian Student Association (AISA) EOP peer mentor Jeike Meijer, a fourth-year global studies and feminist studies double major, worked with another peer mentor to plan the celebration. Meijer served as the Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs for the 2018-2019 school year and was the first Native American to serve as an Associated Students executive at UCSB — a focal point of her campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Through 500 years of colonialism and a tribal genocide, my people are supposed to be gone, but I’m still here, so [Indigenous Peoples’ Day] stands to me as resilience and I remember my ancestors, my family and how much they fought so that I can be here,” Meijer explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One major focus of the celebration was the resilience of the native and indigenous communities, which attendees touched on by sharing stories from their personal histories. Allison Dutra, a second-year zoology major who attended the event, found the emphasis on family origins particularly impactful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it was really cool how [attendees] touched on their roots, the efforts that they’re putting in today to help kind of restore [what] once was here,” Dutra said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One attendee used their time to speak out against Chancellor Henry Yang’s involvement with the Thirty Meter Telescope Project, currently in construction on Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii – a sacred ground for native Hawaiians. Yang currently serves as the chair of the telescope’s board of governors; his role sparked backlash from UCSB students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other AISA members touched on the importance of UCSB students being aware of the past Chumash roots of the campus. Linda Murray, an alumna who was involved with AISA during her time at UCSB, believes that UCSB students have a responsibility to honor the Chumash. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We respect [the Chumash] and their culture and know that they’re still here. Natives are not in the past tense — we’re alive and nationally have networks,” Murray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that the role of academia on campus translates to a heightened responsibility to learn about the realities of indigenous history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we’re taking in knowledge, we’re learning and hopefully providing [information] for future generations to say that Columbus Day isn’t okay anymore,” Meijer explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the I.V. Community Services District began acknowledging the Chumash people’s roots to I.V. at the beginning of each meeting with a statement meant to “pay our respects to the Chumash elders, past, present  and future, who call this place, Anisq’Oyo, the land that Isla Vista sits upon, their home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To many in attendance, an important part of the celebration was to recognize the historical inaccuracies in regards to indigenous people, to correct this history and to understand their right to occupy spaces on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The history [needs to] be written correctly for students to know before they get to the university,” Murray said. “It’s really important for us to exchange with each other and to feel that we also belong here when we are actually the original descendants.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90500\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/eop-and-american-indian-student-association-honor-native-communities-through-indigenous-peoples-day-celebration/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90500\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/eop-and-american-indian-student-association-honor-native-communities-through-indigenous-peoples-day-celebration/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/eop-and-american-indian-student-association-honor-native-communities-through-indigenous-peoples-day-celebration/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/eop-and-american-indian-student-association-honor-native-communities-through-indigenous-peoples-day-celebration/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/eop-and-american-indian-student-association-honor-native-communities-through-indigenous-peoples-day-celebration/","id":1946,"author":{"id":54,"name":"Nidhi Satyagal"},"related":[1945,1944,1943],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/54"}},"__N_SSG":true}
