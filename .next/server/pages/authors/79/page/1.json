Although extremely raw and immature physically, Beeler has shown great potential and is already a capable defender with great hands. According to ESPN, Beeler is the No. 131-ranked power forward.</p>\n<p>“He can run and shot block at this level now,” Williams said of his tallest recruit. “He has got to get way more physical, but his upside is as good as anybody in this class — that is why we had to beat out Washington State and other bigger conference teams to get him, because it’s so hard to find bigs that can run at this level.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mitch Brewe</strong></p>\n<p>Mitch Brewe, a 6’8” forward out of Seattle Prep in Seattle, WA, may have the best chance out of any Gaucho to make an immediate impact as a freshman. Brewe is the No. 65 power forward in this year’s class. The lack of depth in the UCSB frontcourt may allow this 230-pound power forward to contribute as a defender and high-energy post player off the bench.</p>\n<p>“Brewe is very strong, very physical and ready defensively,” Williams said. “He is fundamentally sound and can make an immediate impact as a great screener, defender and ball movement guy.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Michael Bryson</strong></p>\n<p>A 6’4” guard from Foothill High School in Sacramento, CA, Michael Bryson has the all-around game to make an immediate and lasting impact on the program in the coming years. Bryson, the No. 81-ranked shooting guard in his class according to ESPN, is known as a great shooter with range. Despite averaging just over 14 points per game in high school, Bryson attracted coach Williams with his all-around game.</p>\n<p>“He is a good shooter but a better basketball player,” Williams said. “He has got a really good basketball sense and makes a great commitment to the defensive end of the floor. He is a complete player that will only improve.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Dalante Dunklin</strong></p>\n<p>Dalante Dunklin is a 6’0” point guard out of Francis Parker High School in San Diego, CA. The No. 40-ranked point guard according to ESPN, Dunklin is an athletic beast. A strong and active player, Dunklin is a physical presence that can blow by a defender for a dunk or hold his ground defensively. With junior Nate Garth and freshman T.J. Taylor returning as point guards, it is unsure whether Dunklin will redshirt or not, and if he will be able to acquire playing time next season. “[Dalante] is way more of a physical presence than any point guard we have had recently,” Williams said. “I think he is physically ready to come in and play at this level. The adjustments will come within growing up and being a point guard in terms of leadership and all that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Aamahd Walker</strong></p>\n<p>Coach Williams’ latest recruit, Aamahd Walker, committed to attend UCSB after signing a national letter of intent in early April. The 6’2” shooting guard from Culver City High School in Culver City, CA is a natural wing scorer in the mold of recently departed senior shooting guard Orlando Johnson or last year’s recruit, redshirt freshman John Green. According to ESPN, Walker is the No. 69-ranked shooting guard in the nation in his recruiting class.</p>\n<p>Walker averaged 20.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.5 steals, 3.0 assists and 1.1 blocked shots per game during his senior season. He also shot 46 percent from the field, 33 percent from three-point range and 76 percent from the free throw line. Walker’s outstanding performance led to a Second Team All-CIF selection and First Team All-Ocean League.</p>\n<p>“He is really talented offensively — a natural scorer,” Williams said. “If we don’t redshirt him, I would expect him to make an immediate scoring impact. … He made such a commitment of wanting to be here. He really had to work and change certain aspects of his academics and he worked very hard to make it happen.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to the freshmen of this year’s class, UCSB will return three redshirt freshmen in 6’5” guard John Green, 6’8” forward Taran Brown and 6’1” walk-on guard Duke DaRe. The rest of the Gaucho roster is expected to be filled out by three sophomores, two juniors and a lone senior.</p>\n<p>“A lot of how we play and determining which of our freshmen will redshirt next season will depend on our bigs,” coach Williams said. “In Big Al [Williams], we have a legitimate center, but with him off the court we have to play a smaller lineup. If Brewe or Beeler can come in and contribute right away, then we won’t have to worry about catering to our big lineup and our small lineup in different situations.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46971\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46971\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-17/rebuild-reload/","id":721,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[720,719,718],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Begins Defense of of Big West Tournament Title","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/M-BBALL-v-UCR-2.11.2012-Kenneth-Song-72901.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/M-BBALL-v-UCR-2.11.2012-Kenneth-Song-72901.jpg?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will begin its defense as the two-time defending Big West Tournament Champions today when the team faces Pacific in the first round of the conference tournament at the...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team will begin its defense as the two-time defending Big West Tournament Champions today when the team faces Pacific in the first round of the conference tournament at the Honda Center in Anaheim.</p>\n<p>“We feel good coming into the weekend, but we are very realistic,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “It’s a one-and-done situation and you have to play your best for three straight days.” Santa Barbara (18-9 overall, 12-4 Big West) enters the tournament this year on a roll as the No. 3 seed, having won six of the team’s last seven games.

On Jan. 28, the Gauchos escaped on the road to beat the Tigers 56-53. The 56 points were a season low, but Santa Barbara was able to get it done with solid defense, holding Pacific to 31.2 percent shooting. At home on March 1, UCSB dominated Pacific 76-61 behind a season-high 28 points and career-highs eight assists and six three-pointers from senior guard James Nunnally.</p>\n<p>“We have to control [Pacific’s] penetration,” coach Williams said. “If we come out and play hard and match up with them well, I like our chances.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Orlando Johnson and Nunnally both were honored as members of the All-Big West team earlier this week. Johnson, a top-25 finalist for the John R. Wooden Award, received First Team All-Big West honors for the third consecutive season, the first UCSB player ever to accomplish that feat. Nunnally was named to the Second Team All-Big West for the second time in three years. Johnson averaged a team-leading 20 points per game on the season, and led the team with 2.9 assists per game. Nunnally was second on the team with 15.9 points per game and first with 6.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great for them that they made All-League,” coach Williams said. “It is a great honor. Nun has played exceptionally well, as well as the best players in the league, and OJ continues to be OJ … I am very proud and very happy for both of them.”</p>\n<p>The Tigers are led by junior forward Travis Fulton and sophomore forward Ross Rivera, both of whom received All-Big West Honorable Mentions. Rivera was also named Sixth Man of the Year in the conference. Rivera leads the team with 11.4 points per game, while Fulton leads the team with 5.7 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>If they beat Pacific, UCSB will face the winner of No. 2 Cal State Fullerton (21-8, 12-4) and No. 7 UC Irvine (11-19, 6-10) in a game on Friday at 6:30 p.m. on ESPNU. The championship game is on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN2.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton and Irvine play the game right after our, so if we win we will watch them play,” coach Williams said. “We have watched tape on both schools, but we just ahve to take this one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>All tickets for Big West Tournament games are $10 for students.

I didn’t want that Second Team honor, I feel like I am First Team … It will just make be hungry going forward though; I’m motivated like crazy right now. I just want to prove to everybody and all the coaches that voted against me that they made the wrong choice.</p>\n<p><em>Nunnally was voted Second Team All-Big West in 2009-10 and an Honorable Mention All-Big West last season. He averaged 15.9 points per game and 6.2 rebounds per game this season, both career highs.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: After scoring 24 points on Senior Night last weekend, you moved into fourth place on the All-Time UCSB scoring list with 1,619 career points. Did you ever imagine this being possible when you came here as a freshman?</p>\n<p>JN: No, I never did. My first two games here I barely played — like 10 minutes a game. So I didn’t think that would be possible. Then I started to play more and more … at first it was looking rocky, but it’s been great since. … It’s pretty amazing looking back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: So after you went through your whole recruiting process, what led you to come to UCSB?</p>\n<p>JN: I didn’t really know too much about the university, then my coach back home that I was real close with — my brother’s junior college coach — he kind of was guiding me where to go. He told me, ‘It’s a good program; they are going to be bringing in a couple more freshmen to reboot the program.’ Then when I came on my visit and played with the guys, everyone was really cool, and the guys were accepting. They just sold me — it felt like the perfect fit.</p>\n<p><em>Nunnally’s older brother, Michael, transferred to Pacific, where he and James played against each other multiple times.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: You and Orlando Johnson came in here together four years ago. You guys were freshman roommates, are great friends and now are two of the top four leading scorers in school history. How has it been to accomplish all that you have alongside a great teammate and friend like OJ?</p>\n<p>JN: It’s unbelievable. When we came in, we just said we wanted to win and do things players had never done at this school. It’s just been really, really fun, man. I’m honored to play with OJ … playing with OJ has been special — if they double him, I’ll be open, if they double me, he’ll be open, and I find him. We just feed off each other; it’s a good chemistry we have.</p>\n<p><em>Orlando Johnson ranks first on the all-time UCSB scoring list with 1,754 career points.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: This year your overall game has evolved, as you seem to be more patient on offense. Was this a conscious effort by you to improve in certain areas?</p>\n<p>JN: I have definitely made a leap this year. It’s just all the hard work I put in over summer. One of my best friends, we watched film together and worked out all summer. I just worked on everything I need to work on, you know? My post-game, seeing the floor, change of speed — just everything. And it really helped me.</p>\n<p><em>Nunnally averaged a career high 2.6 assists per game this season.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: It was just announced that this season was the highest average attendance for the men’s basketball program in 17 years. What does it mean for the team on the court to have that kind of fan support at home?</p>\n<p>JN: Really?! Wow. That means a lot to us. We love to see the Gaucho Locos out there and all the fans from the community. It really helps us on the court; they are like the sixth man. I love playing against big crowds especially at home … it motivates us even more because we are doing it for the school and the community, and not just for ourselves.</p>\n<p><em>The Thunderdome drew an average crowd of 3,323 per game in 14 home games this season, the highest since 1995. Highlights were a sellout of 6,000 vs. Long Beach State on Jan. 21, and over 5,000 in back-to-back games vs. San Diego State and UNLV in November.RP: Off the court, what are your favorite things to do?</em></p>\n<p>JN: I just like to chill. I like to hang out, stay mellow … listen to music, hang out with my friends, watch sports all day. I like going to the beach if the weather is nice. I go and check out downtown SB a little bit. You know, just a little bit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: Any pre-game rituals we should know about?</p>\n<p>JN: I just take a nap. I take like a 45-minute nap and then get in the shower, nothing too crazy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: Kobe or LeBron?</p>\n<p>JN: Kobe. That’s my guy. Kobe is the one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: What gets you fired up? Any trash talk?</p>\n<p>JN: I have a chip on my shoulder because people have overlooked me. I have the attitude like I’m the underdog. That’s the main thing that gets me going … when people start talking that gets me going too; that’s extra motivation. I don’t usually start the trash talk, but it will get me going.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: How many tattoos do you have?</p>\n<p>JN: I have about 17 tattoos.</p>\n<p>RP: Favorite one?</p>\n<p>JN: My favorite is the one on the left inside of my arm, of my mom’s name.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: What does the future hold for James Nunnally?</p>\n<p>JN: I’m definitely going to pursue my dream and try to get drafted or picked up in the NBA. That’s my number one priority. I feel like I’m an NBA player, and I feel like I can make it, and I feel like I am gonna make it … just gotta keep working hard and staying humble and hungry.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: Do you have a favorite moment or memory from your four years here?</p>\n<p>JN: On the court, my favorite memory here was the chance to play against North Carolina in my freshman year. It was Hansborough’s first game back from injury, Ty Lawson, Danny Green, Wayne Ellington … that was a fun game in a fun atmosphere.</p>\n<p><em>North Carolina went on the win the National Championship that season. Nunnally had season-highs of 22 points and seven rebounds in the game. Hansborough, Lawson, Green and Ellington were all drafted to the NBA.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: What about off the court?</p>\n<p>JN: Off the court, I gotta go with Floatopia 2009. That was probably one of the funnest days ever.</p>\n<p>RP: Yeah that was epic, and we were lucky — we caught that last one as freshmen.</p>\n<p>JN: We did! We caught the last one. One of the best days ever.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: You guys have won each of the last two Big West Tournament Championships, beating the No. 1 seed this year, Long Beach State, both times. Any predictions for the tournament this weekend?</p>\n<p>JN: No prediction — we are just going to play our hearts out. It’s win or go home now and as a senior, the stakes are much higher.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: When you look back on your time spent here in Santa Barbara, how will those memories be?</p>\n<p>JN: My time here has had its ups and downs, and all in all I have loved it.

Williams has started 14 of 24 games overall for the Gauchos, including 13 of 14 in conference play. Taylor has started nine games overall for UCSB, including eight in conference.</p>\n<p>“Al and T.J. have really both created their own opportunities by playing well when given the chance,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Especially Al; every time he played he was productive and his minutes just got extended as he carved out a niche for himself.”</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that anyone who has seen a UCSB game this season knows Williams’ niche is rebounding the basketball. The 6’7” big man is currently averaging 8.2 rebounds per game in conference play, good for third in the Big West. His 1.9 blocks per game also rank third in the Big West. Impressively, Williams has more offensive rebounds on the season, a statistic in which he ranks first place in the league, than defensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I know my biggest impact is rebounding the ball,” Williams said. “It takes pressure off my guards knowing they can put up shots and I’m under the basket rebounding … I just try to go after it and get it done — it’s fun to work hard.” <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/T.J.-Taylor-vs-UNLV_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=307%2C220\" alt=\"\" width=\"307\" height=\"220\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>“It is invaluable to know your role as a player,” coach Williams said. “The key to being successful, whether you are a player on a team or in a corporation, is that you see what you can bring to the table. … Al sees what he brings, he does what he is best at and he is excited about doing it every day.”</p>\n<p>Big Al has become a fan favorite this season, as the Gaucho Locos’ cheers often reach their loudest after Williams blocks a shot, grabs an offensive rebound or dives for a loose ball.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot of fun to go out there and try to bring as much energy as possible,” Williams said. “Our fans are loud and supportive … we do it for them, we represent this whole campus and school, it feels good that they are supporting us.”</p>\n<p>Standing at 5’9”, Taylor is the lightning to Williams’ thunder. Often the smallest guy on the court, Taylor makes up for his lack of size with exceptional speed and fearlessness.</p>\n<p>“He has got great quickness and is a natural leader,” coach Williams said. “He has this natural charisma about him that is just contagious.”</p>\n<p>As a young point guard often asked to run a veteran-laden team, the responsibility of being a leader is magnified. Taylor, who ranks fifth on the team in minutes and third in assist-to-turnover ratio in conference, is accepting and embracing the challenge with an eye toward the future.</p>\n<p>“If I can become a good leader for this team with a veteran group, it will help me in the future,” Taylor said. “I would like to work on becoming more vocal, more fearless and just fully taking advantage of the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The recruiting experiences for Williams and Taylor were not alike, as different circumstances in the past few years eventually brought the pair to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Williams played high school basketball in Phoenix, Arizona, and was not highly recruited out of high school despite winning two state championships in his sophomore and junior seasons.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really start getting recruited until the summer between my junior year and senior year,” Williams said. “That was the last recruiting period so I guess you could say I was a late bloomer.”</p>\n<p>Initially unsure of whether Williams was a good fit for UCSB, coach Williams decided to make an offer after attending a tournament to watch him play.</p>\n<p>“Watching him in a tournament in Arizona, I remember a specific play where he was running the length of the floor at full speed,” coach Williams recalled. “He picks up a ball thrown at his ankles in a dead sprint and finished with a finger roll right over the rim … a guy with that kind of ability for a big man is just rare.”</p>\n<p>Taylor’s path to UCSB began differently. Out of Oakland, Taylor had originally committed to Santa Clara as a sophomore before later deciding to reopen his recruiting. That is when coach Williams swooped in.</p>\n<p>“I liked T.J., but I fell in love with the kid when it came down to the in-home visit,” coach Williams said. “When I went in the home and got to know his family and his mother and grandmother, I fell in love with the kid. I walked out of the home and said I would really love to have him — he would be a great fit for our program.”</p>\n<p>As this year’s squad looks to close out its season with a Big West championship and trip to the NCAA Tournament, Williams and Taylor understand that their impact at UCSB will be felt for years to come.</p>\n<p>“It only gets better,” Taylor said. “We don’t plan on having any dip in the program in the future. We will be coming strong here for the next three years.”</p>\n<p>“We will be the sophomore veterans next year,” Williams added.</p>\n<p>A bit of an oxymoron, but that is quite possibly the truth. As the only two regular starters returning to a team that will lose five seniors to graduation, much of the leadership roles will fall on their shoulders.</p>\n<p>“That’s why it’s good for us to be out there getting the experience,” Taylor said. “To set the tone for the next three years.”</p>\n<p>While excited and optimistic about the program’s future, coach Williams remains reserved with his expectations.</p>\n<p>“They have some big shoes to fill,” coach Williams said. “They still have a lot to prove. … However, I love the fact that they are excited about it and I do think this freshman class has a chance to be as great as our graduating senior class right now.”</p>\n<p>The immediate future will allow both Williams and Taylor to make a difference in the Gauchos’ postseason run this season, but the freshman duo will have three more years to make a lasting impact on the UCSB men’s basketball program.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

He hit his first two shots of the game, the second a three-pointer that gave him the record. The Seaside, Calif., native now has 1,710 career points in only three seasons for UCSB, after transferring from Loyola Marymount following his freshman year.</p>\n<p>“Orlando has been a special player,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He has had an unbelievable career, and to set this record in only three years is a great accomplishment … he has improved so much because he works on his game so hard — he is relentless.”</p>\n<p>Nunnally, who currently has 1,570 career points for the Gauchos putting him at No. 6 all-time, shared his coach’s sentiments about his teammate and friend.</p>\n<p>“I’m proud of that guy, man,” Nunnally said of his former freshman roommate. “Ever since he got here he has worked hard, always in the gym … I’m really proud of him; that’s one of my best friends.”</p>\n<p>Up 21-16 in the first half, the Gauchos got hot offensively. Behind seven points from Nunnally, UCSB ran off an 11-0 run to extend its lead to 32-16. Both Johnson and Nunnally reached double figures by halftime, but 10 offensive rebounds by Cal Poly kept them within striking distance at 31-40.</p>\n<p>“I liked how we played tonight,” Williams said. “I liked our energy level … we are a team that is getting better … I was happy with our effort in the second half, especially on the boards after that first half.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly fought to cut the deficit to seven on multiple occasions early in the second half, but could get no closer. With the score at 49-42, Johnson took over. The senior captain assisted on three-pointer from junior guard Nate Garth, then scored five straight points capped off by a steal and slam dunk on the ensuing fast break. Johnson hung on the rim and slapped the backboards; he was consequently whistled for a technical foul on the play.</p>\n<p>“I just got a little too emotional,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had trouble closing out the Mustangs, but held off its rivals just long enough. The final eight-point lead was the Gauchos’ smallest since the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final two games of the season this week at home, against Pacific on Thursday and UC Davis on Saturday. After that is the Big West Tournament, beginning next Thursday.</p>\n<p>“We are just trying to get better every game,” Nunnally said. “We have been improving every game and are on the right track heading into the conference tournament.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45015\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45015\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/santa-barbara-tops-rival-cal-poly-6860/","id":764,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[763,762,761],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB, Cal Poly Clash Saturday on ESPNU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Senior guard Orlando Johnson needs just three points to become UCSB’s all-time leading scorer as the third-place men’s basketball team is set to host Cal Poly in a nationally-televised Saturday ni...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AnnieHall_mbball-v-UCR_2.11-5.jpg?resize=285%2C237\" alt=\"\" width=\"285\" height=\"237\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Senior guard Orlando Johnson needs just three points to become UCSB’s all-time leading scorer as the third-place men’s basketball team is set to host Cal Poly in a nationally-televised Saturday night matchup.</p>\n<p>UCSB (15-9 overall, 9-4 Big West) is coming off a lopsided loss at Long Beach (20-7, 13-0) on Wednesday night.

The Gauchos traveled to Cal Poly, and barely escaped with a narrow 58-57 victory. Down by two with less than 10 seconds left in the game, a bouncing three-pointer from Johnson fell through the net with just under five seconds left. Senior forward David Hanson had a shot at the buzzer for the Mustangs, but couldn’t convert and UCSB took the victory. The win was the 223rd of Head Coach Bob Williams’ career, good for first place in school history.</p>\n<p>The 49ers opened up an early lead over the Gauchos in Long Beach on Wednesday night and never looked back, leading for nearly the entire game on their way to a 70-58 victory. 20 turnovers, including 12 in the first half, plagued the Gauchos and led to 23 Long Beach points. Missed free throws also hurt Santa Barbara. The team missed nine free throws in the game, hitting only 14-of-25 (56 percent) from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>“The turnovers were huge,” Peterson said. “We didn’t really execute too well when we had chances to cut into their lead. We kind of shot ourselves in the foot.”</p>\n<p>Johnson scored a game-high 20 points to bring his career total to 1,694, only two behind first-place Alex Harris (1,696 points from 2004-08). What’s even more impressive for Johnson is that he has only played three full seasons in a UCSB uniform, after transferring from Loyola Marymount after his freshman season.</p>\n<p>With the win, Long Beach clinched a second consecutive Big West regular season title and will enter the Big West Tournament as the No. 1 seed. UCSB is currently the third seed, behind second place Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>This game will be the first in a three-game homestand to finish off the season for the Gauchos. Tip-off is set for 8 p.m. on ESPNU.</p>\n<p>“It feels so good to be home, it seems like we have been on the road non-stop lately,” Peterson said. “Hopefully we can finish off the season strong and get a good seed heading into the Big West Tournament.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44977\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-24/ucsb-cal-poly-clash-saturday-espnu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44977\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-24/ucsb-cal-poly-clash-saturday-espnu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-24/ucsb-cal-poly-clash-saturday-espnu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-24/ucsb-cal-poly-clash-saturday-espnu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-24/ucsb-cal-poly-clash-saturday-espnu/","id":761,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[760,759,758],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Long Beach State 70-58","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Long Beach State continued its dominance of the Big West conference Saturday night, as the 49ers (20-7 overall, 13-0 Big West) beat visiting UCSB 70-58.

In front of a sold out crowd in The Pyramid, Long Beach improved to 10-0 at home. With the loss, Santa Barbara (15-9, 9-4) falls to third place in the conference and 7-6 on the road this season.</p>\n<p>Long Beach is 2-0 against UCSB this season after losing to the Gauchos in each of the past two Big West Tournament Championship games. This marks the second year in a row in which the 49ers have swept the season series against the Gauchos. In a matchup earlier this season, Long Beach handed Santa Barbara a 23-point loss at home.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Jaime Serna corralled the opening tip for the Gauchos, and senior guard James Nunnally hit a jumper to give UCSB an early 2-0 lead. Long Beach, behind the home crowd dressed for the whiteout, ran off 11 straight points to take the lead before a Nunnally dunk off a pass from junior guard Nate Garth ended the 49er run.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos battled back to cut the deficit to three at 19-22 behind two Nunnally free throws, but Long Beach responded with a run of its own.

Long Beach cruised the rest of the way to the win. The 49ers’ largest lead reached 19 points with six minutes remaining, and the closest Santa Barbara got was the final deficit of 12.</p>\n<p>Johnson didn’t take his first shot until more than five minutes into the game, and couldn’t find the net early. He shot himself out of an early hole and finished with a game-high 20 points on 8-of-16 shooting. Nunnally added a double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The 49er trio of Ware, senior forward Eugene Phelps and junior guard James Ennis led the way for Long Beach, all scoring in double-figures. The 49ers outshot UCSB from the onset, finishing with a 44.3 shooting percentage compared to the Gauchos’ 35.7.</p>\n<p>Long Beach was coming off a loss at Creighton (24-5, 13-4 Missouri Valley), where the Blue Jays knocked off the 49ers on a last second fall-away jumper. The loss was just the team’s first in 12 games dating back to December.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final three remaining games of the regular season at home in the Thunderdome, beginning this Saturday against Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44940\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-23/gauchos-fall-long-beach-state-7058/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44940\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-23/gauchos-fall-long-beach-state-7058/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-23/gauchos-fall-long-beach-state-7058/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-23/gauchos-fall-long-beach-state-7058/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-23/gauchos-fall-long-beach-state-7058/","id":759,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[758,757,756],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Head to Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In a nationally televised matchup costarring the top two teams in the Big West conference, the UCSB men’s basketball team will travel to face undefeated Long Beach State tonight.

For his efforts last weekend in road wins over UC Irvine and Utah State, he was named Big West Player of the Week for the sixth time in his career, tying him with two current Long Beach State players — senior guard Casper Ware and senior guard Larry Anderson — for the third most in Big West history. Johnson is currently third on the UCSB all-time career scoring list, just 13 points out of second place and 22 shy of the school’s all-time record.</p>\n<p>“We are a really confident team right now,” Johnson said. “We had to grow up a little bit, and I feel like we did that in the past few weeks — we are getting better each game.”</p>\n<p>Nunnally ranks second on the team and 10th in the conference with 12.9 points per game and ninth in the conference with six rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Long Beach (19-7, 12-0 Big West), after playing one of the toughest nonconference schedules in the country, entered Big West play with a .500 record at 7-7. Since then, the 49ers have dominated Big West opponents, winning 12 games in a row by an average margin of victory of 13.3 points.</p>\n<p>“It just takes a good game [to beat Long Beach],” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “No doubt we will have to play very well and execute, but it won’t take a perfect game. They have played well, but are by no means untouchable.”</p>\n<p>Led by four prolific senior starters of its own in guards Ware and Anderson and forwards T.J. Robinson and Eugene Phelps, Long Beach leads the league in scoring defense (62.7 points allowed per game), field goal percentage (.486), rebounding margin (+4.5) and steals (6.4 per game).</p>\n<p>“They are a team that just has a different gear than any other team, especially defensively,” Williams said. “We have to adjust and control the game on the offensive end — that means being more physical, setting good screens, and taking care of the basketball.”</p>\n<p>Several NBA scouts will be in the house on Wednesday night, with Johnson and Ware as the main attractions. In a matchup between the schools earlier this season, it was all Ware and Long Beach as the 49ers jumped out to an early lead and never looked back. Behind a stellar .587 percent shooting performance, Long Beach stunned a sell-out crowd at the Thunderdome to beat the Gauchos 71-48. UCSB was never able to get a rhythm going and had a tough time finding easy buckets all game.</p>\n<p>“The main thing is that we need to come out with a better defensive energy than last time,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>While Long Beach thrives on pushing the ball in an up-tempo offensive system, the Gauchos will attempt to combat the 49ers’ speed with their own big lineup.</p>\n<p>“We don’t think we took advantage of our big lineup against them,” Williams said. “We didn’t get our big guys — mainly Jaimé [Serna] — the ball enough in the right positions.”</p>\n<p>This will be Santa Barbara’s final road game of the season, as the Gauchos will play their final three games at home in the Thunderdome. Tip-off is set for Wednesday night at 8 p.m. on ESPN2.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44889\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-22/gauchos-head-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44889\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-22/gauchos-head-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-22/gauchos-head-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-22/gauchos-head-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-22/gauchos-head-long-beach-state/","id":756,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[755,754,753],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins ESPN BracketBuster","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Led by its two senior captains, the UCSB men’s basketball team beat Utah State on the road Saturday night 72-64 in a nationally televised ESPNU BracketBuster matchup.

UCSB senior forward Jaimé Serna turned the ball over and fouled Utah senior forward Morgan Grim. Upon jumping up from the ground, Grim hovered over Serna and was charged with a technical foul for taunting. Nunnally proceeded to make both foul shots for the Gauchos, and they ran off nine consecutive points to stretch the lead to 65-52. The lead never dipped below eight points, Santa Barbara’s margin of victory at 72-64.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is a looming trip to Long Beach State on Wednesday for a nationally televised matchup on ESPN2. Long Beach is currently undefeated in the Big West and beat UCSB earlier this season by 23 points.</p>\n<p>“We definitely would love to keep this momentum going into Long Beach,” Williams said. “We have a big challenge to finish off our last road trip.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-wins-espn-bracketbuster/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-wins-espn-bracketbuster/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-wins-espn-bracketbuster/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-wins-espn-bracketbuster/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-wins-espn-bracketbuster/","id":757,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[756,755,754],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to Utah State for ESPN Bracket Buster","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Coming off an 85-62 dismantling of UC Irvine on the road Wednesday night, the UCSB men’s basketball team will travel to Utah State on Saturday night to take on the Aggies in a nationally televised E...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off an 85-62 dismantling of UC Irvine on the road Wednesday night, the UCSB men’s basketball team will travel to Utah State on Saturday night to take on the Aggies in a nationally televised ESPNU Bracketbuster game. <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/M-BBALL-v-UNLV_Kenneth-Song_2011-season.JPG-4.jpg?resize=270%2C179\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"179\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>“[Wednesday] night was one of the best games we played from start to finish,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We defended well, shot well and were really unselfish.”</p>\n<p>In the win at Irvine, senior guard Orlando Johnson led the way for the Gauchos with game highs of 25 points and 10 rebounds.

That will be a tough test for us to see how good we are.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off a 60-52 win over UC Riverside at home on Saturday. Despite a season-low 23 points in the first half, UCSB rallied for the win in the second half behind 19 points and nine rebounds from senior forward Jaimé Serna.</p>\n<p>UCSB beat Irvine handily at home earlier this season 74-56. In that game, the Gaucho scoring was distributed as three players scored in double figures, with none scoring more than 15. Senior guard Orlando Johnson led the way with 15 points, and freshman center Alan Williams pulled down a game-high 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos remain tied for second place in the Big West with Cal State Fullerton (16-7, 8-3). The team’s final road game of the season will be against first place Long Beach State (19-6, 12-0) next Wednesday, Feb. 22.</p>\n<p>The prolific Gaucho scoring duo of senior guard Orlando Johnson and senior forward James Nunnally continues to climb the UCSB record books. Johnson now has 1,627 points for his career, good for third place all-time. He enters this road stretch needing 70 points to pass Alex Harris (1,698 points from 2004-08) and become the school’s all-time leading scorer.</p>\n<p>“They have both had great careers here,” Coach Williams said. “They have scored a ton and been great all around players, plus they are both highly motivated to finish strong. I know they want to go out on a high note this season.”</p>\n<p>Nunnally scored 15 points in Saturday’s win over UC Riverside to increase his career total to 1,506 — good for sixth place all-time. Nunnally has scored in double-figures in 20 of 21 games this season, and needs 75 to move into fifth place all-time.</p>\n<p>“We are just trying to stay focused on getting these last six wins, and just continuing to play hard,” Nunnally said. “I have had an amazing time [at Santa Barbara] these past four years and I am glad I picked to play at this school. We just want to finish it off right and play hard and get some wins. That’s what it’s all about.”</p>\n<p>After being named Big West Player of the Week two weeks ago for his efforts — including 33 points in two games — in road wins over UC Davis and Pacific, Serna has been on fire ever since. While the Gauchos shot a dismal 35 percent from the floor in the team’s win over Riverside, Serna kept the team afloat by hitting 7-of-10 shots. A model of offensive efficiency, Serna currently ranks fifth in the nation with a .664 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>After the three-game road trip, UCSB will return home to the Thunderdome on Feb. 25 for the final three games of the season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44659\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/gauchos-head-south-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44659\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/gauchos-head-south-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/gauchos-head-south-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/gauchos-head-south-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/gauchos-head-south-uc-irvine/","id":784,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[783,782,781],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Grinds Out Win Over UC Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite a slow start on national television that saw UCSB match their lowest scoring output in a first half on the season, the Gauchos rallied to win a close game over UC Riverside 60-52 in the Thunde...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Untitled-33.jpg?resize=130%2C213\" alt=\"\" width=\"130\" height=\"213\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Despite a slow start on national television that saw UCSB match their lowest scoring output in a first half on the season, the Gauchos rallied to win a close game over UC Riverside 60-52 in the Thunderdome on Saturday night.</p>\n<p>“We weren’t very pleased with how we played,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “But I think it is good for us to have to win a game like that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB (13-8 overall, 8-3 Big West) remains tied with Cal State Fullerton (16-7, 8-3) for second place in the Big West.

Senior forward Jaimé Serna led the Gauchos with 19 points and 9 rebounds and continues to be a model of efficiency on the inside. After 7-for-10, Serna is currently fifth in the nation with a 66.4 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to come out and play hard,” Serna said. “I have some great teammates and they attract a lot of attention — we just gotta keep it rolling now.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward James Nunnally added 15 points, and sophomore guard Kyle Boswell added a career-high six assists. Nunnally’s 15 points moved him past the 1,500 career points mark, as he became the sixth player in school history to exceed the landmark.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t even realize,” Nunnally said of his scoring milestone. “That will matter one day down the line when I leave here, but right now I’m just trying to help my team win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB came out ice cold in the first half, shooting 24.1 percent from the field, including 0-for-9 on three-pointers. Solid defense kept the Gauchos in the game and they entered the locker room down 23-30.</p>\n<p>“We were coming off of six of our best practices, this and last week,” Williams said. “That first half didn’t remotely look like the team I have been coaching in practice. I challenged them a little bit in the locker room, because we haven’t played well on television.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came out of the locker room with a newfound energy and began to slowly chip away at Riverside’s lead. A Boswell three-pointer with 9:18 left to play brought the Gauchos within one point at 37-38, before another three-pointer by Nunnally gave UCSB its first lead of the game at 42-40. The Gauchos did not trail the rest of the way, using eight free throws in the last six minutes to seal the game 60-52.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will hit the road for three straight road games beginning next Wednesday at UC Irvine. UCSB will return home Feb. 25 to finish out its conference schedule with three straight home games.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44567\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/ucsb-grinds-win-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44567\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/ucsb-grinds-win-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/ucsb-grinds-win-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/ucsb-grinds-win-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/ucsb-grinds-win-uc-riverside/","id":783,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[782,781,780],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Returns Home to Face Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Home sweet home.

With a week off to practice and recover, UCSB looks forward to the opportunity to avenge a loss at Riverside (11-12, 5-5) earlier this year. In that game on Jan. 12, the Gauchos lost to the Highlanders 79-70 in overtime.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big game,” senior forward/guard Christian Peterson said. “From here on out we have to win out because we want that second seed in the Big West tournament. Each game becomes more and more important, especially coming off a loss.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s lone loss on the road trip was against Cal State Fullerton (15-7, 7-3) on Saturday. Fullerton was on fire offensively in the team’s win over the Gauchos, shooting 52.5 percent from the floor and a blistering 65.4 percent on three-pointers.</p>\n<p>“We played a team that got really hot,” coach Williams said. “I told (the players) to keep their head up and don’t let this game cause a hangover. We played well on the road trip and had been getting better.”</p>\n<p>In that loss, two prolific Gauchos reached career milestones. With 28 points in the game, senior guard Orlando Johnson moved into third place all-time in the UCSB record books, becoming the fourth Gaucho ever to reach 1,600 career points. With at least eight games remaining, Johnson has a firm chance at becoming UCSB’s all-time leading scorer. In the same game, senior guard James Nunnally poured in 19 points, increasing his career scoring total to 1,491 — good for sixth place all-time.</p>\n<p>The loss to Fullerton dropped the Gauchos into a tie with the Titans for second place in the Big West, behind only first-place Long Beach State (17-6, 10-0). Santa Barbara lost to Long Beach at home earlier this season, but will get a chance for revenge when the team travels to face the 49ers on Feb. 22.</p>\n<p>UCSB has already played in three televised games, going 0-3 in those contests. The Gauchos have three more games planned for national TV — an ESPNU BracketBuster matchup at Utah State on Feb. 18, the Long Beach State game on ESPN2, and a Feb. 25 home game against Cal Poly on ESPNU.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if it pumps us up or not — we are kind of oblivious to it to be honest,” Coach Williams said of playing on the national stage. “We need to play our best basketball, and we are disappointed that we have not played particularly well on national television.”</p>\n<p>“It brings more people out to the games which is fun,” freshman center Alan Williams said of playing on the national stage. “With more fans in the seats, we feed off that energy and noise.”</p>\n<p>After the Riverside game this Saturday, the Gauchos will once again hit the road for a three-game road trip. After the road trip, the team will finish off its Big West season with three straight games at home.</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday is at 7:30 p.m. The game is televised on Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/","id":780,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[779,778,777],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Continues Road Trip, Faces Fullerton on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will travel to Cal State Fullerton tomorrow night to face the Titans in its final game of a four game road trip.

One of those games is an ESPN Bracket Buster game at Utah State (12-10, 4-3 WAC) on Feb. 18.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, UCSB started off the road trip with a convincing 86-59 win over UC Davis on Thursday. Two days later, a game at Pacific went down to the wire. With 29 seconds left in the game, sophomore guard Kyle Boswell hit a three-pointer to put Santa Barbara up by one at 52-51. The Tigers took the lead back with two free throws, but a foul by Pacific and clutch free throws from senior guard Orlando Johnson with 14 seconds left eventually iced the game for the Gauchos 54-53.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great way to start off our trip and a stretch where we have [seven of eight] on the road,” Williams said. “This will be the most crucial part of our season, and we are focused on taking care of business.”</p>\n<p>This year’s Gaucho squad may be one of the deepest teams in recent memory for Coach Williams. All 11 players — including three freshman — have started at least one game for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We are still searching for the right combination … how we want to play,” Coach Williams said of his rotating lineups. “We think the big lineup has been very productive and has allowed us to do things defensively.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/","id":774,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[773,772,771],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/79"}},"__N_SSG":true}
