The Gauchos (9-7 overall, 4-2 Big West) will look to rebound from a tough loss at home to first place Long Beach State (14-6, 7-0) on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara plays seven of its next eight games on the road. The Gauchos’ lone home game over that span is against UC Riverside (10-9, 4-2) on Feb. 11. UCSB remains tied in second place in the Big West with Cal State Fullerton (12-6, 4-2) and Riverside.</p>\n<p>Prior to the loss to Long Beach, the Gauchos had won three consecutive home games. UCSB has not fared as well on the road, where it is 2-4 this season. Three of the team’s four road losses came in nonconference games, against formidable opponents Washington, Cal, and BYU. Santa Barbara’s latest road loss came at UC Riverside on Jan. 12, where the Gauchos lost a heartbreaker 79-70 in overtime.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Senior standouts Orlando Johnson and James Nunnally continue to produce for the Gauchos this season.</p>\n<p>Despite off games for the prolific scoring duo against CSULB on Saturday (Johnson shot a season low shooting percentage, and Nunnally has a season low five points), Johnson leads the Big West with 19.6 points per game on the season, and Nunnally ranks seventh with 15.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>In last Thursday’s game against Cal State Northridge, Johnson became the fifth Gaucho ever to score over 1,500 career points.

More specifically, the rumors assume that Ainge could abandon the prospect of competing for a title this season and trade one of his aging veterans (most likely Paul Pierce or Kevin Garnett) in an attempt to get younger and jumpstart the Rajon Rondo era of the franchise.</p>\n<p>While a shortened and condensed regular season was expected to work against aging, shallow teams like the Celtics, it is obvious that the team is struggling beyond the schedule. Boston, whose strong defense has been a staple of the team since gaining Garnett, currently has the No. 29 defense in the league, a statistic that may even be inflated because the Celtics have played the fourth-easiest schedule so far. Furthermore, Boston lacks the diverse offensive weapons to attack the stout defenses of the Chicago Bulls and Miami Heat — the best in the East.</p>\n<p>Even if Ainge could find a suitable trading partner for Pierce (the team’s most likely tradable asset), which would be beyond difficult (Pierce is owed $48 million through 2014), I am here to say that he should refrain. Unless he can pull off a Pierce-for-Josh Smith or Pierce-for-Rudy Gay swap (which are actually trades that could make sense for both sides), the Celtics should see where this team could take them in the playoffs. And really, all they have to do is make the postseason for an outside shot to reach the NBA Finals. Either way, Boston has virtually nobody beyond Pierce and Rondo on the salary cap next season, which is when Ainge should begin the rebuilding process for his storied franchise.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Daily Nexus <em>sports editor Ryan Porush is currently on the trading block.

But once the game began, UCSB struggled offensively as Long Beach State used a 23-2 run to cruise to a 71-48 victory.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t stay as resilient as you have to when you are playing a team of Long Beach’s athletic ability,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I thought we were a little fragile out there. We didn’t stay fighting.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers (14-6 overall, 7-0 Big West) cruised past UCSB (9-7, 4-2) and its 2-3 zone defense, shooting a blistering 58.7 percent from the field to remain in sole possession of first place in the conference. The Gauchos are currently tied for second place with UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“They shot the hell out of [the ball],” senior forward Jaimé Serna said. “We started off well and we were right there with them, and it just didn’t happen for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 35.1 percent as a team and scored a season-low 48 points, as senior captains and leading scorers Orlando Johnson and James Nunnally suffered through off nights, shooting a combined 5-for-22 from the field. Johnson finished with 10 points and Nunnally had a season-low five points. Freshman Alan “Big Al” Williams and senior center Greg Somogyi each scored a team-high 10 points for the Gauchos. Santa Barbara’s previous low was 50 points in a loss at Berkeley last month.</p>\n<p>“Quite frankly we have to knock down shots and we have to take better care of the ball,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Four out of five Long Beach starters scored in double figures, led by senior guard Larry Anderson with 19 points. Senior guard Casper Ware poured in 14 points and a game-high five assists, and senior forward T.J. Robinson, the leading rebounder in the Big West, posted a double-double with 11 points and a game-high 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>With 07:34 to play in the first half, sophomore guard Kyle Boswell hit a three-pointer to give the Gauchos a 21-18 lead — the last lead they would have in the game. Long Beach went 7-for-8 from the floor and ran off an 18-2 run to head into the halftime up 36-23.</p>\n<p>“You just can’t let Long Beach get in transition,” Williams said of the Big West leading 49er offense.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker room, it was more of the same struggles for the Gauchos. A layup from Ware and a three-pointer from Anderson crushed any hopes for a Gaucho run out of the locker room, as the 49ers continued their devastating run, extending their lead to 41-23 with 19 minutes left. UCSB was able to cut the deficit to 43-27 on a baseline dunk by Johnson with just under 18 minutes to play, but never got closer than that. Long Beach reached its biggest lead of the night at 65-34 on a layup from Anderson, before eventually winning 71-48.</p>\n<p>“We just have to flush [this game] out,” Serna said. “What’s tough is that we want to play our best in front of a sell-out crowd, and then to come out and get blown out … You win some, you lose some.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will hit the road for four straight games, as the Gauchos play seven of their next eight away from the Thunderdome. UCSB will play at UC Davis and Pacific this weekend, and will return home next on Feb. 11 when it hosts UC Riverside in a game televised on PrimeTicket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-23/gauchos-suffer-lopsided-loss-long-beach/","id":800,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[799,798,797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Long Beach on National Stage","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This is what it’s all about.

The 49ers are coming off a 78-69 win on the road at Cal Poly on Thursday night. A team that thrives on a fast-paced dynamic offense, Long Beach State leads the Big West in scoring offense (74.4 points per game), scoring margin of victory (14 per game), and field goal percentage (47.7 percent).</p>\n<p>“You have to slow them down, they are by far the best transition offensive team,” Williams said of the 49ers. “They get out and fly offensively. We will have to contain [Casper] Ware — he is a one man wrecking crew — and keep them off the boards.”</p>\n<p>Ware, the senior Long Beach point guard who joined the Gauchos’ Johnson on the Wooden Award Preseason Top-50 list, ranks third in the Big West with 16.4 points per game. Long Beach senior forward T.J. Robinson and senior guard Larry Anderson rank 10th and 8th in the conference in scoring, with 14.7 and 12.6 points per game, respectively. Robinson leads the conference in rebounds with 10.3 per game.</p>\n<p>“They are a really good team, there is no doubt about it,” Williams said. “They get pretty fired up to play us. The taste of what happened in the Big West championships against us is something that they carry in their mouth. … We are going to have to fight that fire and beat their intensity.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers gained national notoriety for its amazingly tough nonconference schedule. At one time, Long Beach’s RPI (Rating Percentage Index, a measure of strength of schedule) was No. 1 in the country, after the veteran squad beat then No. 9 Pittsburgh and No. 14 Xavier, and played other nationally ranked squads to close decisions.</p>\n<p>“They play the toughest schedule they can get,” Williams said. “[Long Beach Head Coach Dan Monson] feels it makes his team battle tested, and is a great way to prepare them for the Big West.”</p>\n<p>The matchup at Long Beach may be even more important, given the Gauchos upcoming schedule. After facing the 49ers tomorrow night, UCSB plays seven of its next eight games on the road, including four straight away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“Those seven of eight games on the road is a daunting task,” Williams said. “We just have to focus and take care of business at home first.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hopes to capitalize on its home court advantage against Long Beach. The Gauchos are 6-2 at home this season, having only narrowly lost to No. 16 San Diego State in overtime and No. 14 UNLV in double overtime. With national television cameras in the Thunderdome, a crowded and rowdy student section is expected.</p>\n<p>“Some of the best crowds we have ever had have been at home this year,” Williams said. “It really pushes us on.”</p>\n<p>In the win over Northridge, both teams played zone defense the entire game, with the Matadors applying full-court pressure. Although CSUN leads the conference in steals per game, UCSB came out on top in all of the “hustle” categories, recording more rebounds, blocks and steals.</p>\n<p>Despite taking seven fewer shots than CSUN in the first half, UCSB entered the locker room with a 31-22 advantage. The Gauchos came out slow at the onset of the second half, and turnovers allowed the Matadors to run off an 11-0 run to take a 33-31 lead with 17 minutes remaining, Northridge’s first lead of the game. At that point, coach Williams had seen enough, and decided to sub in a fresh five off the bench.</p>\n<p>“I think that was the first time this year that I have [subbed in] five new,” Williams said. “There was just an energy on the floor that had to change. The great thing is that nobody hung their head, and they all played better when they went back in.”</p>\n<p>UCSB rallied and — behind a 13-0 run of their own — was able to stretch its lead to 57-40 with 6:30 to play. Unable to close out the Matadors UCSB once again let up on the gas, allowing CSUN to hang around.

The Matadors, who currently lead the Big West in steals per game, beat UC Davis (1-16, 0-5) on Saturday after losing to Pacific (5-12, 1-4) and Long Beach State (12-6, 5-0).</p>\n<p>Freshman center Alan “Big Al” Williams has started the last three games for the Gauchos, contributing in a big way as a force inside. Williams has averaged 8.8 points per game and a team-leading 10.5 rebounds per game and 2.5 blocks per game, which both rank him second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Al is just a beast,” senior guard Orlando Johnson said of the freshman big man. “You can’t really keep him off the glass … He is so big and strong, but also very athletic.”</p>\n<p>Using Williams has allowed Coach Williams to play a bigger lineup, sliding senior forward Jaime Serna — who often starts at the center position — to power forward. Serna, who was hurt on Jan. 5 against Cal State Fullerton, missed the game at UC Riverside and played minimally against UC Irvine, but is expected to start tonight against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>“Our big lineup has been very productive for us,” Coach Williams said. “It allows us to be versatile off the bench and create some nice mismatches.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are 6-2 at home this season, with their only losses coming in overtime against San Diego State, and double overtime against UNLV in November. After two consecutive home games this weekend, Santa Barbara will hit the road, where it plays four straight — and seven of the next eight contests — away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“All home games are really important,” Coach Williams said. “You want to win games at home and take care of business as much as possible.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>CENTER: Andrew Bynum (LA Lakers)</p>\n<p>Pretty predictable, yet incredibly amazing. Four out of five starters from Los Angeles make up this extremely well-rounded team that should have chemistry right from the start. How much fun is Chris Paul going to have running the point for this team? — that is, until Kobe decides he wants a fifth All-Star game MVP and starts shooting (and making) fadeaway corner three-pointers with 20 seconds on the shot clock.</p>\n<p>RESERVES: Russell Westbrook (G, OKC Thunder), Monta Ellis (G, GS Warriors), Pau Gasol (F, LA Lakers), Kevin Love (F, MIN Timberwolves), LaMarcus Aldridge (F, POR Trail Blazers), Dirk Nowitzki (F, DAL Mavericks), Marc Gasol (C, MEM Grizzlies)</p>\n<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS: Kyle Lowry (G, HOU Rockets), Steve Nash (G, PHO Suns), James Harden (G, OKC Thunder), Danilo Gallinari (F, DEN Nuggets), Rudy Gay (F, MEM Grizzlies), David Lee (GS Warriors), Marcin Gortat (PHO Suns)</p>\n<p>It was hard to leave Lowry ­— who is having a huge breakout year — off the roster, but I just couldn’t give him the nod over Ellis, who seems to be overlooked every year. He could make the roster over one of the power forwards, and it would seem to be Nowitzki’s spot he would take. Dirk is having a down year for the Mavs, but I have to believe he will begin to turn it around. I think Nowitzki gets voted in partly based on his resume, and the fact that his team would be complete garbage without him.</p>\n<p>EASTERN CONFERENCE:</p>\n<p>GUARDS: Derrick Rose (CHI Bulls), Dwayne Wade (MIA Heat)</p>\n<p>FORWARDS: LeBron James (MIA Heat), Carmelo Anthony (NY Knicks)</p>\n<p>CENTER: Dwight Howard (ORL Magic)</p>\n<p>The East starters (and these will be the starters) might as well call themselves “The Monstars.” Five hall-of-famers, and five of the best eight players in the league make up the group. Can you say, fast break?</p>\n<p>RESERVES: Rajon Rondo (G, BOS Celtics), Deron Williams (G, NJ Nets), Ray Allen (G, BOS Celtics), Chris Bosh (F, MIA Heat), Josh Smith (F, ATL Hawks), Amar’e Stoudemire (F, NY Knicks), JaVale McGee (C, WAS Wizards)</p>\n<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS: Brandon Jennings (G, MIL Bucks), Jose Calderon (G, TOR Raptors), Joe Johnson (G, ATL Hawks), Andre Iguodola (F, PHI 76ers), Ryan Anderson (F, ORL Magic), Greg Monroe (F, DET Pistons), Tyson Chandler (C, NY Knicks)</p>\n<p>The East All-Stars were not too difficult to pick, apart from deciding who would back up Howard at center. The spot would normally belong to Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks, but he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury last week. I decided to give the spot to JaVale McGee over Tyson Chandler and Spencer Hawes. Chandler has the name recognition (and will probably get the spot) and Hawes is in the midst of a breakout year for a breakout team, but McGee has the athleticism and motor to thrive off the bench for the East. After all, the All-Star game is all about entertainment, and McGee averages a league-leading 3.2 blocks per game, and a respectable 2.5 poster dunks a game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THOUGHTS:</p>\n<p>First off, look at those completely fake and totally not official starting lineups … And reserves, for that matter. WOW. The talent level in the NBA may be at an all-time high, and the days of Jamaal Magloire, Wally Szczerbiak and Mo Williams making the all-star team are clearly over. A young influx of superstar talent (Rose, Durant, Griffin, Love and Bynum) is currently fusing with an already thriving superstar crop (LeBron, Wade, Howard, Durant and Carmelo), while both groups battle with an aging class of all-time greats (Kobe, Allen and Nowitzki) who are refusing to pass the torch just yet. This All-Star game has the potential to contain as many as 12 hall-of-famers in it.</p>\n<p>The West has a much deeper team than the East, starting with its big men. This team may boast the conference’s scariest frontcourt since Shaquille O’Neal, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Chris Webber and Dirk Nowitzki combined in their respective primes in the 2002 All-Star game.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the East holds an advantage in athleticism and speed. With several players to run the lanes — and Rose, LeBron, Rondo and Wade to feed them the rock — we are sure to see several highlight dunks.

Because of the team’s recent success, UCSB began this year on much of the country’s radar, receiving votes in the season’s first mid-major poll. Additionally, the Gauchos will be featured on national television as many as seven times during this regular season.</p>\n<p>While recognition on the national scene is nice, it all comes down to conference play for the Gauchos. UCSB received four first-place votes and was picked to finish second in the Big West in the annual preseason media poll released by the conference. Long Beach State (10-6, 3-0), whom the Gauchos beat in the Big West tournament championship in each of the past two seasons, was picked to win the conference.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really put any stock into these preseason ranking and awards,” Williams said. “It is all about being hungry, staying within yourself as you grow during the year you have a chance to achieve. We are highly motivated.”</p>\n<p>Facing Fullerton (10-5, 2-2) in the team’s home opener, UCSB got off to a slow start but behind solid defense, was able to coast to a 77-64 victory. In the team’s Big West opener on the road at Cal Poly (10-6, 1-2) last week, senior standout guard Orlando Johnson’s three-pointer miraculously bounced in with five seconds left to give the Gauchos a one point lead and decisive advantage. The win gave Williams, who is in his 14th season as head coach of the Gauchos, his 223rd career win.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to make a statement on the road against a good Cal Poly squad to start off</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t exactly how we pictured it,” Williams said of Johnson’s bouncing three-pointer. “We were hoping to get Orlando going to the rim, but the defense forced him outside, and that was that…”</p>\n<p>With a preseason John R. Wodden Award, preseason Top 50 and Lute Olson Preseason All-American, Johnson leads the Gauchos with 20.4 points per game — good for first place in the Big West and 13th in the nation. After transferring from Loyola Marymount, the 6-foot-5 player was named the Big West MVP as a sophomore two</p>\n<p>seasons ago, and has led the league in scoring each of the past two seasons (including a Gaucho single-season record of 674 points last season).</p>\n<p>Johnson and Nunnally (16.5 points per game, fourth in the Big West) — both of whom were selected to the Preseason Big West All-Conference Team — form the best 1-2 scoring punch in the conference.</p>\n<p>“It helps us a lot,” Johnson said of he and Nunnally. “We are similar in a lot of ways — athletic, long, shoot the ball well … When one of us has an off-night, the other one is usually there to pick up the scoring slack. It’s something that other teams have to worry about.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s third returning senior starter is forward Jaime Serna. An All-Big West Tournament pick a year ago, Serna is currently third in the nation with a .692 field goal percentage while averaging 9.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I would certainly like to see Jaime get more shots up,” Williams said. “He is unbelievably productive, and when he’s active he is the best big man in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>Mixed in with the experienced veterans are two key transfers and several freshmen that will be asked to make an immediate impact for the squad. Junior guard Keegan Hornbuckle, a transfer from Colorado, has come on strong as of late after returning from an early season injury. Junior guard Nate Garth, who was forced to sit out last season after transferring from New Mexico, has started nine games for the Gauchos, averaging 2.6 assists per game, as he and freshman point guard T.J. Taylor have split time at point guard.</p>\n<p>UCSB currently has an influx of youth on its bench, with seven freshmen on its roster. Coach Williams will decide which will redshirt as the season continues, as four have played so far on the season.</p>\n<p>“They have all acclimated pretty well,” Williams said of his freshmen. “They will all have to be big contributors for us at some point.”</p>\n<p>Nine different players have started a game for the Gauchos in this young season, and Coach Williams has no plans of slowing down his lineup changes. Based on the opponent and style of play desired, UCSB will continue to thrive on versatility, tweaking lineups to capitalize on advantages.</p>\n<p>“We try to change it up,” senior guard Christian Peterson said. “We are a very versatile team.”</p>\n<p>Last season, in its quest to continue as regular season league champions, UCSB struggled in conference play and limped into the Big West tournament as a fifth seed. An improbable run to win the tournament sent the Gauchos back to the NCAA Tourney, becoming the lowest seed to do so since 1996. Despite a positive end result, UCSB is more focused this season.</p>\n<p>“We have learned from past experiences,” Williams said. “Off the court manifested on the court, and we weren’t cohesive or physically aggressive. It is all about how you continue to grow and improve as a team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opened up the season on fire, winning its first four games as part of a six-game stretch in November at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>However, arguably the team’s two toughest nonconference opponents yet were due into Santa Barbara next. On Nov. 26, UCSB suffered its first loss of the season in an overtime thriller to No. 25 San Diego State, a team that is slated to become a member of the Big West conference beginning in 2013.</p>\n<p>Four days later, another ranked opponent — this time, No. 17 UNLV (15-2) strolled into Santa Barbara fresh off a win over No. 1 over North Carolina. With the rowdy Thunderdome home crowd behind them, the Gauchos battled all game behind Johnson’s 36 points and 10 rebounds, but eventually lost 94-88 in double overtime after a buzzer-beater tip-in from senior center Greg Somogyi forced overtime, and then a UNLV buzzer-beater three-pointer forced a second extra period.</p>\n<p>“It’s just tough to swallow games like that,” Johnson said. “We will just build on it, that’s all we can do.”</p>\n<p>With a 4-2 record in its pocket, the UCSB squad hit the road at the beginning of December for a four game 12-day road trip with games at USD, UWash, UC Berkeley and BYU — teams with a combined record of 41-24.</p>\n<p>“It was a great time for a road trip, right after finals. We love going on the road during that time of the year,” Williams explained. “It is a building and bonding time for the team.”</p>\n<p>The trip began positively after the Gauchos bested San Diego 65-61. Three days later at Washington, 24 points and 10 rebounds from Johnson was not enough as the Gauchos ran out of gas late, falling 87-80 to the Huskies. At Cal (12-3), UCSB struggled mightily in its most lopsided game of the year, falling to the Bears 70-50. UCSB ended its road trip with another close loss against a tough opponent in BYU (12-4). The Gauchos fought hard but were unable to pull the game to closer than seven late in the second half, as a season-high 19 turnovers limited the team’s opportunities.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this team knows it all comes down to conference play, and will use its tough nonconference schedule to learn and grow as a cohesive unit.</p>\n<p>“We are still evolving as a team,” Williams explained. “We are still trying to find ourselves in terms of our identity, but going forward we will have to be a team that doesn’t turn the ball over, defends hard and plays very unselfish. If we get those three things going, I like our chances.”</p>\n<p>Aware of what is at stake, the Gauchos are focused and grounded headed forward.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to just take it one game at a time and get better consistently,” Johnson said. “We want to put ourselves in the best situations and make sure we are on the right path to where we want to go … With the group we have I think will do a good job to not let this season take a bad turn … We want to make this year special, and be a Cinderella team.”</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State: 49ers</strong></p>\n<p>As the reigning No. 2 team in the conference for back-to-back seasons, it may have seemed surprising that Long Beach State would be ranked pre-season No. 1 in the conference. However with four out of five starters returning — including last season’s Player of the Year senior guard Casper Ware — the 49ers will bring back more experienced leaders than any other team in the league.</p>\n<p>“A lot of veterans have been through a lot of different parts of seasons, good and bad,” Head Coach Dan Monson said. “And we’ve had a lot of both. They’ve changed the Long Beach State program.”</p>\n<p>Forward T.J. Robinson, guard Larry Anderson and forward Eugene Phelps each received All-Big West honors last season, and join Ware as the core of the 49ers squad.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s preseason schedule this year was not only one of the toughest for a Big West team, but one of the most challenging in the nation amongst Division I schools. The 49ers faced perennial powerhouses North Carolina, Kansas, Louisville, San Diego State, Xavier and Pittsburgh, all of which made it to the NCAA tournament last March. CSULB was able to upset Pittsburgh and Xavier, each by a 10-point margin. For Monson, the rigorous preseason schedule is another step toward the goal of improvement.</p>\n<p>“My philosophy is that the preseason is to get yourself ready for the season,” Monson said. “It’s really hard for players or teams to know how good they are unless they play good teams.”</p>\n<p>CSULB is thus far undefeated through its first three games of Big West play after beating UC Irvine 74-60 on the road, Cal Poly 55-50 at home, then Cal State Northridge 81-68 at Northridge. Robinson currently averages a double-double with 12.5 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. Ware ranks third in the league in scoring with 16.6 points per game, the highest average of any 49er.</p>\n<p>In each of its Big West championship appearances during the past two years, CSULB has suffered a defeat to UC Santa Barbara. With the return of four experienced seniors this season, Monson hopes to continue playing through March for the first time since 2007.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t just losing to Santa Barbara … we didn’t play well in the [Big West] tournament,” Monson said. “[This year] we have the opportunity to compete for a championship.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton: Titans</strong></p>\n<p>Projected to finish fourth in the preseason Big West conference poll, Cal State Fullerton is off to an impressive start in the 2011-12 basketball season, compiling a 10-5 record (2-2 Big West).</p>\n<p>The Titans, who finished sixth in the Big West last season with a 11-20 record (7-9 in the conference) are headlined by a trio of incoming transfers who have boosted the talent of the team tremendously.</p>\n<p>“It’s been terrific, I don’t know if I’ve ever had a team that gets along as well as these kids do,” nine-year Head Coach Bob Burton said. “They blend in very well; that was the difference of us winning 11 games last year and having 10 already at the halfway point. The difference has been the transfers.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Omondi Amoke, a transfer from UC Berkeley, has led the Titans in rebounding with 8.5 boards per game, good for second in the Big West. Amoke also ranks fourth on the team in scoring, averaging 11.5 points a game.</p>\n<p>“He’s not only given us good scoring, rebounding and defense, but a lot of leadership too,” Burton said. “The kids have appointed him the captain of the team unanimously.”</p>\n<p>Pacing the highest-scoring offense in the Big West have been a pair of junior guards in Kwame Vaughn and D.J. Seeley, transfers from San Francisco and Berkeley, respectively. Vaughn is second on the team with 15.3 points per game and leads Fullerton with over four assists a contest. Seeley meanwhile is the team’s leading scorer at 15.5 points a game on the season.</p>\n<p>Fullerton used a seven-game winning streak, the last two of which were in conference, to come into Big West play strong before dropping tightly contested matchups to UCSB and Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We actually lost a couple of games I thought we should have won, but all in all I’m really happy with the preseason we had,” Burton said. “Starting 2-0 in league has really been great for us.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the starting five for the Titans are sophomore guard Isiah Umipig and senior forward Orane Chin, the most veteran player on Fullerton’s roster.</p>\n<p>Burton envisions his team playing tough down the stretch and competing for a spot in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s feasible, but it’s going to be very difficult,” Burton said. “Obviously Long Beach and Santa Barbara are the two dominant teams in the league. I think in this league anything can happen. I think we have the capability to do it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: Mustangs</strong></p>\n<p>Touting the Big West’s top defense in points allowed per game, Cal Poly currently holds a 10-6 record (1-2 in conference) entering the second week of conference play.</p>\n<p>Finishing last season second in the Big West at 15-15 (10-6 conference), the Mustangs were picked to finish third in the preseason conference poll.</p>\n<p>“Our number one goal: keep improving,” three-year Head Coach Joe Callero said. “If we keep improving, we feel like we have enough talent this year that we can be competitive and we have a chance to win the postseason tournament and get to the big dance.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Mustangs is senior forward David Hanson, a preseason Big West first team selection after garnering second team honors last year. Hanson currently leads Cal Poly in scoring at 10.9 points a game, while second on the team in rebounds, averaging over five a game.</p>\n<p>“The best part about David is that he is such a calm and confident guy,” Callero said. “He brings not just great play, but a great maturity and great poise, and that’s what you rely on out of your seniors.”</p>\n<p>While securing impressive road victories over Fresno State and USC, the Mustangs have fallen short against a number of top teams including two five-point losses to both DePaul and St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p>“We had five or six games against good if not great teams,” Callero said. “I think it has prepared us well. I think a lot of teams in the conference have played really good preseason games.”</p>\n<p>Conference play meanwhile has been cruel to Cal Poly with a 55-50 loss at Long Beach and a 58-57 defeat from UCSB at the hands of an Orlando Johnson last second three-pointer.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs rebounded with a win over Fullerton on Saturday for their first conference victory.</p>\n<p>“I think we would have liked the bounces to have gone a little bit better,” Callero said in reference to Johnson’s winning shot. “That always hurts. You win some games that way and you lose some games that way. The first two games we played very well, we just got pinched in the last minute of the game.”</p>\n<p>Playing important roles for the Mustangs this season are a pair of senior transfers from Hagerstown College in forward Will Taylor and point guard Amaurys Fermin. Both were eligible to play last season but were redshirted due to academic and health issues.</p>\n<p>Taylor is fourth in the conference with a team-high 7.8 rebounds per game while averaging better than 10 points a contest. Fermin meanwhile also averages over 10 points and is second in the conference with four assists per game.</p>\n<p>“It gives us a really true experienced point guard in Fermin and gives us another real aggressive rebounder and post up player [in Taylor],” Callero said. “They played junior college together so they have very good team chemistry too. They really know how to play well together.”</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside: Highlanders</strong></p>\n<p>There are few teams in the Big West playing as well as the UC Riverside Highlanders are right now. After stumbling out of the gates to a 1-4 start, they have won six of their last 10 games and sport a 7-8 (1-1 in conference) record early on in the conference portion of the season.</p>\n<p>“I think we got off guard a little bit,” Head Coach Jim Wooldridge said. “I think we all felt that since we had a number of returning players that we would have a better identity early on. We got humbled a bit, and then we started to realize what we had to do to be a better team.”</p>\n<p>Like most coaches, Wooldridge pays little mind to preseason rankings. He knows that his team will face stiff completion from the rest of the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We knew coming into the season that Santa Barbara and Long Beach were the two best teams in the league, and then from there it is a mixture of teams,” Wooldridge said.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders are lead by a pair of senior guards, Phil Martin and Kareem Nitoto, who lead the team in most statistical categories. They stand out most, however, in their contribution to the team’s offensive output. Martin leads the team with a whopping 242 points, 16.1 per game, and Nitoto is second with 151 points (10.1 per game). In comparison, the third highest scorer on the team has put up just 83 points.</p>\n<p>“They are critical to our success,” Wooldridge said. “If you look at our scoring, we’re somewhat limited in that department. If those guys play well offensively then it really gives us a chance to win ball games. We don’t have a whole lot of other options currently, so we have to rely on both of those guys to play that role for us.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have lately reaped the benefits of junior guard Robert Smith, who transferred from Santa Clara this season and had to sit out the first several games due to the NCAA’s transfer rules. Even with the missed time he has put up nine points per game for a total of 72 points.</p>\n<p>“He’s changed our team,” Wooldridge said. “He’s helped us win a few ball games at home and on the road. He’s a talented young man. He’s brought a level of confidence to the other players on our team, because they know that they can rely on him to make plays.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders’ real strength, however, lies on the defensive side of the ball. They lead their opponents in steals and blocks per game and are +0.1 in the turnover margin. In order to succeed in a competitive Big West, they will need to continue their strong defensive play.</p>\n<p>“Well the numbers look pretty good right now,” Wooldridge said. “I think we can play better defense. I think that’s going to be the staple of this team. It is the only way we can consistently win ball games.”</p>\n<p>Though 1-1 is only a so-so start to the conference portion of their schedule, the Highlanders have the potential to contend for a Big West title. They enter conference competition playing well, and, with players like Martin, Nitoto and Smith leading the way, they have to potential to be a force to be reckoned with in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Defensively, [we need to] finish possessions get defensive rebounds [and not] allow second chance opportunities to creep into the ball game,” Wooldridge said. “Offensively, when we’ve been successful, we’ve had good balance; we’ve moved the ball; we share the ball; we get the ball into the lane.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders are coming off a two-game road win streak and will now head home to do battle with UCSB and Cal Poly. Both are teams they must beat in order to contend for the Big West title.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis: Aggies</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis men’s basketball team enters its fifth season in the Big West conference after finishing last season at the bottom of the conference table, finishing 10-20 overall and 4-12 in conference play. Led by new head coach, Jim Les, the Aggies have started this season on a nine-game losing streak, going 1-12 and 0-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>After coming off their worst season since entering the Big West conference, Les has the task of replacing most of its offense from last season including its top two scorers in Mark Payne and Joe Harden, as well as losing 49.5 percent of their assists and 48.9 percent in steals. With only two seniors on the team, the Aggies have struggled in finding consistency so far in the season.</p>\n<p>“Right now we’ve been inconsistent with the guys we need to step up,” Les said. “We’re searching for answers in terms of guys that can replace that productivity. We need multiple guys to step up and play, and be more productive for us.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way for the Aggies this season will be senior guard Eddie Miller who started all 30 games last season and finished second on the team in total steals (32) and third in scoring (12.5). Last year’s Big West Co-Freshman of the Year, sophomore guard/forward Josh Ritchart is the Aggies’ leading scorer averaging 12.2 points per game and is team leader in blocks with 10.</p>\n<p>The Aggies will have to replace junior guard Ryan Sypkens who, before going down with a knee injury for the season was averaging 14.5 points per game. Head coach’s son, sophomore guard Tyler Les also appears to play a prominent role in the offense. Last year Les played in 25 games and shot 50 percent from behind the arc and is second in the league in three pointers (2.75).</p>\n<p>“[Tyler] is getting more playing time and he’s in a system and culture he’s comfortable with, and that’s allowing him to step up and produce,” Les said. “He’s a young player, he needs to continue to grow and get better. His work ethic in practice every day is allowing him to have success on game night.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies have had a rough start to the season where they have lost their last nine games including their first conference match against Cal State Fullerton. Davis’ offense ranks eighth in the conference with 62.5 points per game and are last in defense giving up 75.9 points per game, averaging 15.9 turnovers per game.</p>\n<p>In his first year at UC Davis, Head Coach Les is trying to bring enthusiasm and relevance to the program by bringing in an up tempo and high scoring offense to the team, which is ranked second in the conference in three point field goal percentage (36.5), but has struggled in bringing in a tough, physical defensive mentality to the team.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten off to a rough start but I think we’ve made some strides,” Tyler Les said. “Defensively there’s a lot more intensity, a lot of ball pressure, it’s definitely helping us individually and as a team. If we play hard and bring it every night we should be at the top of the conference.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/big-west-basketball/","id":788,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[787,786,785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tuesday Ballin’ With Ed. and Ed.: Sports Editors Pella & Porush Tackle Some Early Season NBA Headlines","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Thunder & Lightning The Oklahoma City Thunder have gotten off to the fast start we expected, but at 8-2 the Thunder may be even better than advertised.

Kevin Durant is continuing to grow and improve, which is saying something when you are already the two-time defending scoring champion. James Harden is in the midst of a breakout year, and has morphed into Oklahoma City’s third best player and a spark-plug off the bench — the ‘Lamar Odom of the Thunder,’ if you will. Harden has provided the all-around perimeter game expected when he was taken with the third overall pick in 2009.</p>\n<p>This team is young and deep. They like each other, play well together and buy into their coach’s game plan. Right now, it’s looking more and more like OKC is the team to beat in the West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Ultimately, this team will go as far as Russell Westbrook can take them. The offensive-minded Westbrook needs to learn how to be effective as a game manager and pass-first point guard. He doesn’t need to transform himself, just be able to recognize when he should facilitate and feed the ball to Durant every time down the floor. Not impossible, right?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Welcome to Lob City</strong></p>\n<p>And so the tale is told … David Stern, in his customary tyrannical grandeur and douchebag-ness, declared that the mighty Lakers could not acquire the treasure, and he disallowed the exchange. The one whom they call Chris Paul was stuck in purgatory, but a new land was to arise out of the ashes of controversy.</p>\n<p>LOB CITY was born!</p>\n<p>The Clippers are 4-2 so far, and have looked both like one of the best teams at times and one of the worst at others. It would seem that this inconsistency stems from adding three (Chris Paul, Chauncey Billups and Caron Butler) of the team’s six most important players to the mix during this shortened offseason. These inconsistencies would be more likely to disappear if Vinny Del Negro weren’t the head coach.</p>\n<p>Either way, CP3 needs to shoot the ball more and be more aggressive as a scorer offensively. Blake Griffin needs to keep doing his thing. DeAndre Jordan needs consistency. Billups needs humility (he is no longer a volume shooter, but a three-point shooting veteran presence at this stage in his career). And Vinny Del Negro needs a new haircut.</p>\n<p>Like a 40-year-old hippie wandering through the Coachella desert on acid, this team is still finding itself. Mainly, the Clippers need to learn how to win. Close-game experience in situations that actually matter, despite being virtually nonexistent in Clipper history, can’t be accurately replicated in practice.

We aren’t going to play as fast, but have advantages inside and on the glass.”</p>\n<p>UCSB got off to a sluggish start offensively in the first half, though their defense remained stout. The Gauchos took an 18-16 lead on a three-pointer from sophomore forward Keegan Hornbuckle. The shot sparked an 11-0 run for the Gauchos and they entered halftime leading 35-21.</p>\n<p>Fullerton battled to come back to a 52-43 score with under 10 minutes left in the second half, but the Gauchos responded. An alley-oop dunk from junior point guard Nate Garth to senior center Greg Somogyi ended that Titan run and put the Gauchos back in control. Up by eight points with just over a minute left, it was Johnson’s turn to ward off a Titan run with six consecutive free throws (10-of-11 on the night). The Gauchos’ lead never dipped below eight as they secured the win 77-64.</p>\n<p>“We try to change it up,” Peterson said of the team’s different looks. “We are a very versatile team and can be dangerous when we exploit our lineups against opposing teams.”</p>\n<p>Johnson paced the Gauchos with 23 points and six rebounds despite a poor shooting night (5-for-18 on field goals). Nunnally scored 13 of his 18 points in the first half, and Hornbuckle added nine points, five rebounds and two blocks. Garth recorded a game-high five assists.</p>\n<p>A scary moment for the Gauchos occurred with 12:10 left in the game when senior forward Jaimé Serna rose up to score on a driving layup and was fouled. Serna fell hard to the floor, landing on, and injuring, his right wrist. Luckily for Santa Barbara, X-rays taken the following day came back negative, and Serna is currently day-to-day.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased with the win,” coach Williams said. “[Fullerton] is a really good team. … Overall, it was a productive night for us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to face UC Riverside on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43374\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43374\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/gauchos-top-csf-7764-improve-20-big-west/","id":822,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[821,820,819],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Johnson’s 36 Points Not Enough to Top UNLV","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In front of a loud and restless crowd, the UCSB men’s basketball team fell to visiting No. 18 UNLV 94-88 in double overtime in one of the best games at the Thunderdome in recent memory. “We left e...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In front of a loud and restless crowd, the UCSB men’s basketball team fell to visiting No. 18 UNLV 94-88 in double overtime in one of the best games at the Thunderdome in recent memory.</p>\n<p>“We left everything out there on the court,” senior guard Orlando Johnson said. “I couldn’t be prouder of my team.

UNLV threatened to run away with the game, taking a 57-49 lead after a 12-2 run with seven minutes left to play in the second half. Consecutive three-pointers from senior forward James Nunnally and Johnson brought the Gauchos to within two. The Runnin’ Rebels again held off the home team to take its biggest lead of the game at 69-59 with two minutes left to play after another Moser three, forcing a Gaucho timeout.</p>\n<p>“We knew the game was far from over,” Johnson said. “We practice those situations all the time. … We just kept believing in each other.”</p>\n<p>UCSB came out of the timeout determined not to go down without a fight, and Johnson took over. He started the comeback with an assist on a layup by senior center Jaime Serna. Johnson then ran off seven consecutive UCSB points to go along with a rebound and a steal to cut the deficit to one point at 68-69 with 17 seconds left. On the ensuing UNLV possession, Nunnally stole the ball and was called for a charge on the fastbreak in a controversial play.</p>\n<p>“I thought that first [charge call] was questionable,” Williams said. “It was a tough call, but as a competitor you always want to get those close calls.”</p>\n<p>UNLV took a three-point lead after two free throws, and UCSB had the ball under its own basket, down by three with seven seconds left. As expected, the Runnin’ Rebels opted to foul Johnson, sending him to the line down by three with two seconds left. After Johnson hit the first free throw, Williams subbed in seven-footer Greg Somogyi as the UCSB home crowd collectively held its breath.</p>\n<p>“It was amazing fan support,” freshman point guard T.J. Taylor said. “It was a great atmosphere to play in, and a really fun game…It is just disappointing that we came up short.”</p>\n<p>Johnson intentionally missed the second free throw, and in the scramble for the offensive rebound, Somogyi was able to miraculously corral the ball and toss up a shot, completing the Gaucho comeback to send the game to overtime with zeros on the clock.</p>\n<p>“I just tried to shoot it as high as I could, got a lucky bounce, and the big fella caught it and put it in with no time left on the clock,” Johnson said. “That was a big, exciting moment.”</p>\n<p>When the game is on the line, you expect your clutch players to play their best basketball. Johnson and Nunnally stepped up for the Gauchos in the first overtime period. Rejuvenated and excited after Somogyi’s buzzer-beater, the UCSB squad dug in defensively as the senior duo scored 10 points on 3-of-3 shooting and 3-of-3 from the free throw line to put the Gauchos up three with 13 seconds left. Taylor stepped up to hit a huge three-pointer with the game tied to put the gauchos in front at 81-78 with 1:19 left in the overtime period.</p>\n<p>“I have to be confident and step up in those situations,” Taylor said. “Orlando and [Nunnally] can’t do it by themselves.”</p>\n<p>On the next possession, UNLV recorded an offensive rebound off a potential game tying three-pointer before a second offensive rebound and quick kick-out allowed senior guard Chace Stanback an opportunity at the buzzer. Stanback hit the three as part of his 19 points, all of which came after halftime, to send the game to double overtime.</p>\n<p>“It was just desperation man,” the UCLA transfer Stanback said. “Thankfully I was able to hit it.”</p>\n<p>Williams explained his rationale behind not opting to foul UNLV to send them to the free throw line at the end of the first overtime.</p>\n<p>“Ideally, what we would have loved is to have a foul after that rebound with about four seconds left,” Williams said. “But I wasn’t thinking about fouling with [13 seconds] left.”</p>\n<p>In the second overtime period, Serna was called for an intentional foul that gave UNLV a free point with just under five minutes to play. They never trailed again, ending the game 94-88 behind two Stanback free throws. Another questionable offensive foul on Nunnally with just under four minutes left sent the senior to the bench for good with five fouls.</p>\n<p>“It hurt not having [Nunnally] out there,” Johnson said. “He is always a threat to score and they would trap me and I would have to pass.”</p>\n<p>Nunnally recorded 14 points and 8 rebounds, and senior center Serna added 13 points and six boards. Anthony Marshall recorded a game-high eight assists for the Runnin’ Rebels, and Stanback went 9-of-10 from the free throw line for his 19 points.</p>\n<p>The Runnin’ Rebels previously upset No. 1 North Carolina in Las Vegas 90-80. In that game, Stanback led UNLV with 28 points and 10 rebounds, and Moser with 18 rebounds, and Bellfield with 9 assists.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to give UNLV a ton of credit,” Williams said. “They were outstanding defensively. That’s the best defensive team we’ve played by far.”</p>\n<p>This marks the second consecutive game that the Gauchos have lost in overtime to a visiting Mountain West school. On Saturday night, UCSB fell to SDSU 76-75 in overtime. While the past two games are certainly tough to swallow for the veteran Gaucho squad, the team has some perspective going forward.</p>\n<p>“It’s just tough to swallow, those games like that,” Johnson said. “We will just build on this, that’s all we can do…We can’t sit here and sulk, it was tough and it hurts, but tomorrow we are going to have to forget about it, and get back to studying for finals and getting ready for this roadtrip we got ahead of us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will hit the road for a four-game roadtrip against San Diego, Washington, BYU, and Cal that begins in San Diego on Dec 13.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43285\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43285\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-12-01/johnsons-36-points-top-unlv/","id":821,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[820,819,818],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Continue Home Action Against Westmont","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On a roll through two games this season, the UCSB men’s basketball team will look to remain hot when it hosts cross-town NAIA opponent Westmont College in the Thunderdome Friday night. “It’s a h...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On a roll through two games this season, the UCSB men’s basketball team will look to remain hot when it hosts cross-town NAIA opponent Westmont College in the Thunderdome Friday night.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge cross-town rivalry for them,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We have to stay motivated.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos (3-0) are coming off an 89-56 dismantling of Santa Clara at home on Tuesday night, in which they were led by senior duo Orlando Johnson and James Nunnally.

High energy and urgency are vital for a Gaucho team that should have no struggle scoring the ball any given night. In the win over Santa Clara, Santa Barbara won the battle in every “hustle” category, tallying more rebounds, assists, and steals as well as fewer turnovers than the Broncos.</p>\n<p>“The last few weeks, coach has really been preaching defense to us,” sophomore guard Kyle Boswell said. “Our defense is progressively getting better in practice and it showed in the game. It’s all about the energy level for us — that’s what makes our defense go.”</p>\n<p>The two teams traded buckets to begin the game, going back and forth until UCSB called a timeout down 14-17 with 11 minutes left in the first half. The Gauchos came out of the timeout determined to put the game away. Behind lockdown defense and a patient, unselfish offense, UCSB scored 18 straight points, holding Santa Clara scoreless for almost seven minutes.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos ended the first half on a 28-7 run that featured five different players scoring to stretch the lead to 42-24 at halftime. The run was highlighted by an alley-oop pass from Johnson to Nunnally, who slammed it down with just over three minutes to play.</p>\n<p>“They are a good team, we just played really well tonight,” Nunnally said. “We came into this game with a focused mentality determined not to lose at home.”</p>\n<p>Santa Clara, which shot 4-for-22 from three-point range, hit two straight from beyond the arc to open the second half as part of a 12-7 run to force a UCSB timeout.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, the Gauchos stepped on the throat of the visiting Broncos, a solid team that was ranked in the preseason mid-major poll, and cruised the rest of the way to an easy victory. With multiple NBA scouts in the house, and the shot clock winding down on a possession late in the second half, Johnson received the ball near mid-court and stepped up to hit a shot well beyond the three point line, sending the Thunderdome into an uproar.</p>\n<p>“I look to get more guys involved early in the game and try to be a facilitator,” Johnson said. “I like to make my mark scoring the ball later in the game.”</p>\n<p>Four different players scored in double figures as the Gauchos cruised through the rest of the second half. Unselfish offensive play and great ball movement allowed UCSB to stretch the lead to as many as 32 points on two occasions before closing out the emphatic win by a convincing score of 89-56, the team’s biggest lead of the game.</p>\n<p>“It’s fun to score in the high 70’s and low 80’s and we have the personnel to do it,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Boswell added 12 points for UCSB, and junior point guard Nate Garth dished out a game-high five assists, with some pretty passes to set up teammates as the Gauchos ran away with the game late in the second half. Senior forward Jaime Serna added 10 points and four rebounds before going down with an apparent right knee injury with 15 minutes left in the second half. Williams said Serna will be fine, and only suffered a bruised knee.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense stifled the Santa Clara offense, which made 14 three-pointers in its season debut. Bronco guard Kevin Foster, who led the nation in three-pointers and the WCC in scoring last season, was held to only 12 points on 3-of-13 shooting and 1-of-8 from three.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to the court next on Friday when it hosts NAIA opponent Westmont at home in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42966\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/gauchos-trample-broncos-8956/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42966\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/gauchos-trample-broncos-8956/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/gauchos-trample-broncos-8956/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/gauchos-trample-broncos-8956/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/gauchos-trample-broncos-8956/","id":811,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[810,809,808],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Santa Clara in T-Dome","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will face its first Division I opponent Tuesday night when the team hosts visiting Santa Clara in a nonconference game. “We are looking forward to coming out and try...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Untitled-13.jpg?resize=157%2C213\" alt=\"\" width=\"157\" height=\"213\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">The UCSB men’s basketball team will face its first Division I opponent Tuesday night when the team hosts visiting Santa Clara in a nonconference game.</p>\n<p>“We are looking forward to coming out and trying to stay hot,” senior guard Orlando Johnson said.</p>\n<p>UCSB (1-0) easily handled Division III Chapman in its season debut last Friday, beating the Panthers 74-48 behind a dominant shooting performance.

Two years ago, Santa Clara pounced on UCSB in the Thunderdome, beating the Gauchos 79-64. Last season, on the way to a 24-14 overall record (9-6 West Coast Conference) and a CollegeInsider.com postseason tournament championship in late March, Santa Clara fell victim to the Gauchos, who handed the Broncos the team’s first home loss of the year.</p>\n<p>In that game, senior forward James Nunnally had a career-high 34 points (8-for-11), including four three-pointers while making 14 of 16 free throws. Senior forward Jaimé Serna posted 11 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks, and Orlando Johnson poured in 16 points to go along with five rebounds. Junior guard Kevin Foster scored 25 for the Panthers.</p>\n<p>“It gives us confidence knowing that we beat them [last season],” Johnson said. “But at the same time we have to be humbled and know that they are a good team.”</p>\n<p>Santa Clara began its season with a convincing 80-48 win over NAIA opponent UC Merced. Foster, who led the team last season with 20.2 points per game and 3.7 assists per game, led the Broncos in their season debut with 17 points and six assists. In the win, Santa Clara made 14 three-pointers, with three different players making four or more. Foster, who led the country with 140 threes last season, made a game-high five against Merced.</p>\n<p>“Our perimeter defense will have to be strong,” Williams said. “[Foster] looks to take about 11 [threes] a game, so we have to be ready for that.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42896\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-15/gauchos-host-santa-clara-tdome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42896\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-15/gauchos-host-santa-clara-tdome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-15/gauchos-host-santa-clara-tdome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-15/gauchos-host-santa-clara-tdome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-15/gauchos-host-santa-clara-tdome/","id":806,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[805,804,803],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Offense Rolls Past Chapman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Friday night in the Thunderdome, the opening tip went up for grabs and the UCSB men’s basketball team caught fire offensively.

Senior forward James Nunnally went 9-for-12 from the field to lead the squad with 20 points, 14 coming after halftime.

Chapman was able to cut the deficit to 34-22 at halftime.</p>\n<p>Chapman hung around for a time in the second half, and a Panther three-pointer with 13 minutes left in the second half cut the deficit to nine at 45-36. Then Nunnally took over, scoring five straight points and 10 of the team’s next 13 to help stretch the Gaucho lead to 62-42 with 5:36 left to play. The run was highlighted by a play in which freshman guard T.J. Taylor stole the ball then threw an alley-oop that Nunnally slammed home with 9:18 left in the second half.</p>\n<p>“Running down the court, I saw T.J. and we had a little connection,” Nunnally said. “I knew he was going to throw it and I went up and got it, and got the crowd going behind us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB cruised the rest of the way, finishing off Chapman by a score of 74-48. The Gauchos shot 60.9 percent from the field and 75 percent (6-of-8) from beyond the arc in the second half.</p>\n<p>“It was a great start,” Nunnally said. “We are going to continue to get better every time we step out on the court.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara got great play from its backcourt. Taylor and junior point guard Nate Garth each played 21 minutes and combined for seven points, 10 assists and no turnovers. As a team, UCSB had only seven turnovers to go along with 20 assists.</p>\n<p>“Both [of our point guards] will do nothing but get better as the year goes on,” Williams said. “They have contrasting styles that will both be effective, and are a great twosome for us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to the court Tuesday night when the team hosts Santa Clara in the Thunderdome, the second of six straight home nonconference games to begin the season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42857\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/gaucho-offense-rolls-chapman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42857\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/gaucho-offense-rolls-chapman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/gaucho-offense-rolls-chapman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/gaucho-offense-rolls-chapman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/gaucho-offense-rolls-chapman/","id":810,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[809,808,807],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/79"}},"__N_SSG":true}
