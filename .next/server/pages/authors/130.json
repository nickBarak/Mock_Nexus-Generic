Panelists included Gina Messina-Dysert, Dean of the School of Graduate and Professional Studies at Ursuline College, Nia Malika Dixon, author, filmmaker and founder of Audaz Entertainment and Rabbi Tamara Cohen, Director of Innovation at Moving Traditions. All three panelists are contributors to <em>Faithfully Feminist</em>, a collection of 45 essays on feminism in religion, for which they held a signing after the event.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Moore, religious studies professor and department chair at UCSB, said although religion and feminism are not inherently opposed, there is conflict generated by people’s expectations that an opposition exists.</p>\n<p>“They are not an either-or dichotomy, although the conflict between religion and feminism is real,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert said it is harmful for nonreligious feminists to discount the work of religious feminists, because the success of feminism depends on working together and mutual support between the two.</p>\n<p>“Individuals who identify as religious and feminists receive a lot of judgment, if you will, from both their religious communities and from feminists,” Messina-Dysert said. “I personally find both damaging, but I find judgment from feminists more damaging.”</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert offered her definition of feminism, which she said is inspired by those of Bell Hooks and Rosemary Radford Ruether.</p>\n<p>“I like to talk about feminism as being a movement that is focused on eradicating sexism, yes, but all oppression, because you cannot uproot one without uprooting all,” she said.</p>\n<p>Religion needs feminism, according to Messina-Dysert, as it is still inundated with patriarchal interpretations that lead to oppression.</p>\n<p>“Certainly it is necessary for feminism to be a critical part of religious practice,” Messina-Dysert said. “We need to continue to acknowledge the great oppressions that still exist within religious traditions and find the ways that we can create healing.”</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert spoke specifically about Catholicism to exemplify oppressive religious traditions such as the Vatican’s resistance to reproductive rights and women’s ordination. She said women are a “blind spot” of Pope Francis, who upholds the “theology of complementarity,” which declares a woman’s purpose and value come from her role as a wife and mother.</p>\n<p>Such traditions are not inherently part of religion and should be resisted, according to Messina-Dysert.</p>\n<p>“Certainly, the foundations of religion are not sexist — it’s the interpretations that are,” she said. “Feminism allows us to work toward disrupting those problematic interpretations.”</p>\n<p>Malika Dixon said she believes God gives her the right to stand up for both feminism and religion even though many interpretations hold them in contention.</p>\n<p>“Asking a Muslim ‘why are you feminist?’ to me seems kind of misinformed, because to me, as a Muslim, I believe we are automatically feminist,” Malika Dixon said. “The patriarchy that pervades our religious beliefs is not a part of our beliefs, it’s an interpretation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68035\" style=\"width: 810px\"

traditions such as the unequal status of bat mitzvahs and bar mitzvahs, which she experienced in her conservative synagogue and orthodox school while growing up.</p>\n<p>“Girls could have a bat mitzvah, but not equal to a bar mitzvah,” Cohen said. “We could read from the Torah only on Friday night, which doesn’t really count, and not on Saturday morning.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said her family chose to have a bar mitzvah for her despite the orthodoxy of her synagogue and school, empowering her to fight for feminist reforms to Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>“I had this sense with the way we did it that if something wasn’t fair out there we could change it,” Cohen said. “It wasn’t many years later that a lot of places began to say, yes, you can do it on Saturday morning, and that change happened because women demanded it and feminists demanded it.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said she had a crisis of faith after coming out as a lesbian in college, because conservative Judaism did not allow for ordination of LGBT Rabbis, which lead her to a new understanding of feminism.</p>\n<p>“It really shook me to my core and made me think about ‘what is feminism all about?’ and ‘who is it for?’ and ‘what are the limits of a certain feminism and how do we have to push it forward?’” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>She said she has struggled to assert both her feminist and her Jewish identity due to the popular notion that they are at odds.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to be accepted as what a certain image of what a feminist was and in some sense a certain aesthetic of what a cool dyke was in that moment of the early 90s,” Cohen said. “In some sense I wanted to go underground as a religious person because I couldn’t feel the two together.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said she uses “feminine God-language” in order to unravel the core of many patriarchal religious interpretations.</p>\n<p>“If our images in terms of the ultimate power of the universe and the language we use is only male … it becomes enshrined,” she said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Evelyn Cabral said she strongly agreed with everything the panel members said during the event.</p>\n<p>“Everything to do with feminism and religion is a choice, and the intersectionality between the two of them and the parallels between the two to them,” Cabral said.</p>\n<p>Cabral said she chose to attend the event because it brought together “two good parts” of her life, referring to religion and feminism.</p>\n<p>“Usually it is hard to find events that bring these two parts of your life together. It’s usually either religion or feminism. It’s never both of them together, so that’s why I wanted to come to this event,” Cabral said.</p>\n<p>Mariam Tariq, second-year global studies and political science double major, said as a Muslim feminist she related to many of the experiences the panel discussed.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been feeling a lot of conflict about what is a woman’s role within religion,” Tariq said. “This event seemed like a good way to listen to scholars and hear what they have to say, and I thought it was really enlightening and it was a reaffirmation of everything that I believe and it’s amazing to see other women of different faiths also struggling with the same issues.”</p>\n<p>Tariq said she would like to see more events that combine feminism and faith, which are usually kept in different spheres on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think religion on campus is sort of a touchy subject. Not many people bring it up and there’s very limited spaces where you can bring it up,” Tariq said. “I don’t see this much on campus where you get to see women fighting as feminists and for their religions.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

(EPS) in association with Berkson Associates in May 2015 to conduct a study on the financial feasibility of different self-governance options for I.V.  An oversight committee comprised of representatives of various community demographics advised EPS in an effort to ensure the study accurately represents the fiscal needs and realities of I.V.</p>\n<p>EPS assessed possible services, costs and revenue sources of various options for self-governance in I.V., including a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Assemblymember Das Williams proposed the CSD as part of Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), signed by Governor Jerry Brown on Wednesday afternoon. The study also investigated the feasibility of incorporating I.V. as a city or forming an Area Planning Commission (APC) and Municipal Advisory Council (MAC). The presentation addressed topics such as I.V.’s demographic breakdown, tax revenue and services.</p>\n<p>EPS representative Rebecca Benassini said part of I.V. is currently SB County Service Area 31 (CSA 31), which secures county funding. According to Benassini, I.V. could lose CSA 31 funding and county municipal services under the self-governance options studied, but would maintain other county-based services.</p>\n<p>“Those are the only two of all the services that are provided that we are talking about potentially affecting,” Benassini said.</p>\n<p>Benassini said an APC and MAC, which cannot raise revenue and do not have authority over land use, would be the “simplest” options and would maintain the highest level of county involvement.</p>\n<p>“Those two options are connected to county functions and county powers that don’t really require too much more in terms of formation,” Benassini said.</p>\n<p>If a CSD is formed through AB 3, it will require approval by potential residents through a vote. Residents would also vote on whether to implement a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which would tax residents a portion of their utilities such as gas and water.</p>\n<p>According to the study, an eight percent UUT would fully fund administrative costs with $255,000 remaining for further services, such as tenant-landlord mediation, non-sworn personnel patrol and building inspection. In addition, UC Santa Barbara has pledged an annual $200,000 to CSD services from 2017 to 2024 if AB 3 passes.</p>\n<p>Principal at Berkson Associates Richard Berkson said cityhood would give I.V. the most autonomy but would cause it to suffer a “shortfall” of approximately two million dollars in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>“It would require an additional special tax,” Berkson said. “That would be about $350 to $360 per bedroom per year to fill that gap.”</p>\n<p>According to Berkson, the sole purpose of the study is to inform I.V. residents about self-governance options.</p>\n<p>“We took as objective of an approach as week could,” Berkson said. “We tried to lay out the information so that you, the residents of Isla Vista, can make your own decisions.”</p>\n<p>UCSB history professor and Fund board member Alice O’Connor said the unveiling of the study was a “historically auspicious moment.”</p>\n<p>“It is part of discussion of governance in Isla Vista that dates back at least four decades,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>According to O’Connor, challenges I.V. has faced pressured residents to partake in a “concentrated” and “sustained” effort for self-governance.</p>\n<p>“It is a conversation about governance that has been galvanized by various tensions and events in the community, including police-community tensions, incidents of sexual violence and of course the devastating mass shooting that we went through,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the diversity of the oversight committee, which he sat on, contributed “a lot of expertise” to the study.</p>\n<p>“We had elected officials, business owners, students, university officials that all came together to make this study very effective,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Field Representative with Williams’ office and UCSB alumnus Cameron Schunk said the study provides proponents of a CSD with information to be used in ongoing planning.</p>\n<p>“It really allows us to start the concrete planning and look at what we can do, and not just that, but how do we want to do it,” Schunk said. “Now we’re really going to be focusing on all the different services that could be provided by the CSD proposed in AB 3.”</p>\n<p>Associated Student External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the study will help voters in making the decision on whether to establish the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Now we have the educational information to provide voters with what they need,” Dela Cruz.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said students who have not followed the I.V. self-governance movement likely will not read the published study in its entirety, and she hopes to help distribute the information in a more accessible way.</p>\n<p>“I had a long time reading everything. It’s more than 100 pages, and the only reason I read it was because I’m EVPLA,” Dela Cruz said. “A UCSB student who is not involved in A.S. is going to have some trouble reading that.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said one way she plans to “disseminate” the information in the study is by encouraging professors like O’Connor to raise the issue of I.V. self-governance to their classes.</p>\n<p>“One way I plan to engage students in the voter education part of this is by reaching out to professors like her who can include this as a part of their course, or if they don’t, at least share it with students and encourage them to come,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Senate postponed its regular 6 p.m. meeting to 7:30 p.m. to allow senators to attend the presentation. On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double-major Nawar Nemeh said I.V. self- governance is “hard for senators to ignore” because most UCSB students live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It’s really interesting — the relationship between A.S. and Isla Vista,” Nemeh said. “It’s a responsibility of A.S. senators to come to this.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said it was “surprising” how much cityhood would cost based on the report, and he thinks a CSD is the “most progressive” governance option for I.V.</p>\n<p>“From my perspective we are trying to aim for the most localization possible, but that’s feasible without creating huge tax burden,” Nemeh said. “I think a CSD looks like the best option.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65121\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65121\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/","id":4662,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[4661,4660,4659],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The Index is based on the share of students receiving Pell grants, the graduation rate of Pell grant recipients and the net cost after financial aid for low and middle income students. This year’s results led the NYT to call UC “California’s upward mobility machine.”</p>\n<p>Thirty-eight percent of UCSB students receive Pell grants, with 31 percent also likely to graduate based on past rates, and the net cost for low and middle income students is $14,000.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), University of California Student Association (UCSA) undergraduate chair and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major Mohsin Mirza said NYT’s praise of UC as an “upward mobility machine” is “somewhat incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Students of all incomes struggle with the rising costs of housing and textbooks,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>“While the UC should be praised for the amount of financial aid it provides to low income students, particularly in comparison to other universities, that praise should be tempered with the reality that there is much work to be done.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said while the College Access Index highlights the successes of UC, UCSA will continue to be critical.</p>\n<p>“We see our role as pushing the UC to be the best it possibly can be,” Mirza said. “Praise isn’t effective at creating changes, actions and pressure are.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop said she feels UCSB is “very proactive” in creating economic diversity and its high ranking in the College Access Index is a result of outreach efforts that start long before the admissions process.</p>\n<p>“We work closely with high school and community college counselors to spread the word about opportunities available at UCSB,” Przekop said in an email. “We also work with community organizations and early outreach programs to reach younger students and families as they begin to consider college preparation.”</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, one way UCSB works to serve low-income students is being “visible and available,” providing information that explains the application and financial aid processes and shows low-income families higher education is “a viable pathway to success.”</p>\n<p>“Some families don’t have a history of college attendance and fear that the cost is a barrier to even considering college,” Przekop said in an email. “We have special programs in place to meet the informational needs of first-generation and/or low-income students because they may not have easy access to that information otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said outreach and informational assistance are the only ways UC campuses increase their numbers of Pell-receiving students, because the admissions process itself is “need blind.”</p>\n<p>“Family income cannot be a deciding factor in admitting a student,” Przekop said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, the Office of Admissions promotes UCSB at over 600 high schools every fall and chooses campuses with students of all economic backgrounds, leading to greater economic diversity at the university.</p>\n<p>“These schools include those situated in low-income, middle-income, and high-income regions of the state,” Przekop said in an email. “We want students from all backgrounds because we want a diverse learning community.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and Pell grant recipient Chance Adkins said while he was surprised UCSB is ranked third in the nation on the College Access Index, he is not surprised it was ranked highly given his experience with financial aid opportunities.</p>\n<p>“I was offered more financial aid here than anywhere else,” Adkins said. “Talking to people who attend other universities, the gap between my financial aid and theirs is higher than one would expect, especially between the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Adkins said while he is glad aid is available when needed, he believes the high number of students receiving Pell grants at UC could explain in part the recent increases in tuition and is a sign that public higher education is increasingly unaffordable without aid.</p>\n<p>“With the way that tuition keeps increasing, it makes sense that more people are needing assistance,” Adkins said.</p>\n<p>Mirza said UC should be proud of the ranking but should not let it take away from the urgency to take on “problems that still exist.”</p>\n<p>“Between unaffordable housing, students skipping meals to save money, and the majority of students in the middle class, in particular taking on tens of thousands of dollars in debt, there is much work to be done,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print

up in Pakistan’s formerly Taliban-controlled Swat Valley where she advocated for women’s education after the Taliban declared no girls would be allowed to attend school. In response, a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012. Having made a full recovery, she now continues her secondary education and activism in the United Kingdom. In October 2014, Yousafzai became the youngest Nobel laureate in history.</p>\n<p>The event consisted of a short explanation my Yousafzai regarding her life and activism, followed by a discussion and Q&amp;A session moderated by event sponsor and Malala Foundation board member Susan McCaw. McCaw presented questions pre-submitted by students at UCSB, Santa Barbara Middle School, Montecito Union Elementary and Harding University Partnership School.</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said the Swat Valley was “paradise” before the Taliban took control, but terrorism brought “darkness” to her community.</p>\n<p>“My life was a happy life and, suddenly, things changed,” Yousafzai said. “A villain came. This villain in our story was terrorism — Talibanization. Our peaceful valley turned from a place of tourism to a place of terrorism. More than 400 schools were destroyed at that time. People were flogged, killed; women were not allowed to go outside, girls’ education was banned and life became so hard.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said her father allowed her to go to school even though most girls in the Swat Valley did not, providing her with the foundation that allows her to advocate for fair treatment and education for women.</p>\n<p>“He treated me equally as my brothers,” Yousafzai said. “He allowed me to get education, and I was one of the luckiest girls who got this opportunity … He believed that if we want our society to go forward, if we want our country to succeed, we need to empower women.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she has fought for her own education and universal women’s education because it leads to individual empowerment.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, in a patriarchal society, women lack identity,” Yousafzai said. “They are wives, sisters, mothers, but they are never allowed to have the identity of an individual. I did not want to suffer through the situation of being only called the wife or the mother to someone.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she is “not a lone voice” in her advocacy for women’s education, because she represents all those who are denied the opportunities she seeks to create.</p>\n<p>“When I go and see presidents and prime ministers I say, ‘don’t think this is only this one girl, Malala, speaking to you, these are the girls in Nigeria, these are the girls in Kenya who do not get the opportunity to get their secondary school education,’” Yousafzai said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Effie Sklavenitis said the event taught her the importance of speaking on behalf of others to create change.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a voice, and just because you’re one person doesn’t mean you’re alone. It means that you have to speak up if you want things to change.” Sklavenitis said. “Even when people speak up against you, you still have to keep on talking and keep on expressing your points.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she sees many students in countries with universal education who do not value and take advantage of their opportunities.</p>\n<p>“It’s really sad because, one side of the world, children are fighting, children are struggling for the right to go to school … even if they have to pay, even if they have to travel long distances, even if they have to face the difficulty of having no teachers or sitting in a classroom with 90 to 100 students,” Yousafzai said. “I think all the children who have this opportunity should be very thankful.”</p>\n<p>Third-year geology major Cassidy Meehan said the event prompted her to realize the value of the education she continues to receive.</p>\n<p>“It really made me feel inspired to take advantage of my education,” Meehan said. “It really made me realize, ‘wow, I’m really lucky to have this.’”</p>\n<p>According to Yousafzai, cultures that do not allow for or support women’s education can and should be changed.</p>\n<p>“These cultures and traditions, they are not sent by God from the sky and said that this is your culture and you have to follow it,” Yousafzai said. “It is we people who have made these cultures, and we have the right and duty to change them when they go against basic human rights.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and marine biology double major Francesca Pezzullo said she agreed with Yousafzai that culture should not inhibit human rights.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really interesting to say that we can change our culture, we can change our traditions,” Pezzullo said. “It’s not a good thing to hold on to if it’s impeding on people’s human rights. It’s very important for people to understand that you can’t just hold onto it because it’s familiar. That doesn’t mean it’s right.”</p>\n<p>Pezzullo said the event showed her, despite Yousafzai’s influence and achievements, that the activist is also a “very normal” teenage girl.</p>\n<p>“She seemed like a very genuine person,” Pezzullo said. “She’s exceptional in her situation, but she seems like a down-to-earth person.”</p>\n<p>Sklavenitis said the event inspired her to consider how students’ actions in the United States affect the fight for basic human rights in other parts of the world.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for people to think about their own societies and their own actions every day and how that affects the bigger picture and how that affects anything from women’s rights to education for children, because everything is connected,” Sklavenitis said. “We may live in different places, but at the end of they day we live on the same planet.”</p>\n<p>Pezzullo said Yousafzai’s story demonstrates the effect one activist can have on an issue.</p>\n<p>“You have to be the one to see the change that you want to see happen, which is something that is hard for people to wrap their heads around because they feel like their life is so important personally, they don’t realize you have to actually do it yourself,” Pezzullo said. “Malala is a girl who just did it herself.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64212\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64212\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-28/activist-malala-yousafzai-makes-an-impact-on-santa-barbara-audience/","id":3442,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[3441,3440,3439],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Demand Bookstore Discontinue Jansport Products","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB chapter of United Students Against Sweatshops, Chancellor Henry T.

Yang, Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher and UCSB Bookstore director Mark Beisecker to discuss pulling Jansport products from the Bookstore. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB chapter of United Students Against Sweatshops, Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fisher and UCSB Bookstore director Mark Beisecker agreed in a meeting on Wednesday in room 5123 of Cheadle Hall to halt the Bookstore’s non-backpack apparel purchases from Jansport and discuss alternatives to Jansport backpacks in summer meetings.</p>\n<p>USAS came to the meeting demanding the Bookstore licensees be signatories to the Accord on Fire Building Safety in Bangladesh, a legally binding document that outlines factory safety standards for corporations. Because Jansport is owned by VF Corporation, whose practices in Bangladesh do not adhere to the accord, USAS demanded the Bookstore stop buying the company’s products. At the meeting, Yang also agreed to advocate for similar changes UC-wide by speaking with other chancellors.</p>\n<p>USAS member and third-year global studies major Brandon Yadegari said he became concerned about the Bookstore licensing relationships after Rana Plaza, a factory in Bangladesh, collapsed in April of 2013, killing over 1,100 workers.</p>\n<p>“Since Rana Plaza collapsed in April of 2013, it has been pretty disturbing to us to find out about the relationships and connections between manufacturers that sell clothes to our bookstore,” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>Yadegari said the Bookstore should not work with companies that have factories in Bangladesh such as VF, especially because collegiate apparel is a major source of its profit.</p>\n<p>“In Bangladesh, where wages are the lowest in the world and factories are the most unsafe, it seemed apparent to us as a group to work to make sure our university does not do business with companies that … are unwilling to cooperate for safer standards for those workers or who are owned by a company that participates in such supply chain management,” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>According to Yadegari, while no products in the Bookstore are made in Bangladesh, profits from Jansport products go to VF, which is responsible for serious workers’ rights abuse overseas.</p>\n<p>“VF, their parent company, who owns brands like Vans, North Face and Columbia, still maintains much of their production in Bangladesh, and maintain production that is secured through relationships with local, provincial governments in Bangladesh that have consistently suppressed unionization attempts through violence, in some cases killing,” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>Yang said he would rather work with other UC chancellors to affect system-wide change than act independently as a campus.</p>\n<p>“Many issues are joined issues. If we work together, we have better results,” Yang said. “This is not an isolated issue like an I.V. issue. This is such a good opportunity for me to bring them all on board.”</p>\n<p>Beisecker also said he advised against campus-level action to halt business with Jansport, because it may be politically unsound given other UC campuses also use the company.</p>\n<p>“For me to pull the license from Jansport and for the other campuses to keep theirs, is a real mixed message,” Beisecker said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64013\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64013\" data-attachment-id=\"64013\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/usas_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1433330593\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"120\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"USAS_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64013\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-64013\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Yadegari, multiple campus leadership entities unanimously voted to support a discontinuation of business with Jansport, meaning Yang should meet UCSB USAS’s demand rather than rely upon UC-wide alternatives.</p>\n<p>“We’re coming in with right now, UCSB students, UCSB Associated Students, UCSB Academic Senate, UCSB Graduate Student Association, Chancellor’s Sustainability Committee, obviously USAS, obviously the 2,000 signatures that we got, want action at UCSB,” Yadegari said. “For Chancellor Yang to see our university and our climate and then have to ask other UCs, there is a little bit of a disconnect there.”</p>\n<p>USAS member and first-year math major Kyle Butts said other university campuses have adopted the accord.</p>\n<p>“The decision is not unprecedented,” Butts said. “There are campuses like NYU, Stanford, University of Michigan. There are over 40 universities that have acquired the accord, so we are not alone.”</p>\n<p>Butts said because the UC Code of Conduct for Trademark Licensees Steering Committee’s vastly supported resolution asking UC to adopt the Accord was rejected by UC President Janet Napolitano last summer in favor of allowing UC to do business with signatories of either the Accord or the much more lenient Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, USAS has little faith in the notion of UC-wide reform.</p>\n<p>“We saw UC-wide support. Every campus was in support of trying to get the Accord to be passed, and we saw the recommendation that UC as a whole should require the Accord,” Butts said. “There was so much support for that, and then it seemed like President Napolitano on her own decision ignored the recommendation and said the Alliance or the Accord.”</p>\n<p>According to Yadegari, the Alliance gives corporations more flexibility in determining their own safety standards, which discouraged many student and faculty activists who had campaigned for UC adoption of the much stricter Accord.</p>\n<p>“The Office of the President handed down the decision that either the Accord or the Alliance would be required, essentially giving a lot of companies an easier way out of holding themselves accountable and responsible for the conditions that they perpetuate in Bangladesh,” Yadegari said. “I think that was really demoralizing for a lot of us.”</p>\n<p>Yadegari said, given the shortfall of Napolitano’s decision, campus USASs need to take initiative.</p>\n<p>“At this point, with UC-wide activism being forced into retreat after the president’s decision, USAS at UCSB has come back and said ‘our chancellor will listen to us, we want to work with him, we want to work with our administration,’” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>USAS member and third-year global studies major Dana Patterson said through campus-level adoption of the Accord, UCSB can lead the way for UC-wide change.</p>\n<p>“Our focus has been on this and them being able to extend that to the other UCs, and that’s just our strategy as of right now,” Patterson said. “We’re the most active USAS campus, so we’re very much leading the way … We’re the strongest organization of the UCs working on this. We’re the most proactive group.”</p>\n<p>According to Butts, UCSB’s independent adoption of the Accord could be the most effective step toward UC adoption.</p>\n<p>“By UCSB leading the way and forcing strictly the accord … we could rejuvenate a lot of the activity campaigns toward the Accord,” Butts said. “If UCSB makes the first stride to require the Bangladesh Accord, that gives the committee more power for producing another resolution for Janet Napolitano.”</p>\n<p>Yadegari said Yang needed to represent the student body by supporting the Bookstore’s adoption of the Accord rather than consider UC politics.</p>\n<p>“We can make our own decisions. Every relevant governing body on campus has told you want they want you to do” Yadegari said. “We understand it’s hard for you to put your neck out on the line, but when every student is telling you to, you should.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Beisecker, Fisher and Yang agreed the Bookstore should initiate adoption of the Accord by stopping orders from Jansport for non-backpack apparel, but Fisher said backpack orders would have to continue until USAS presented a comparable alternative.</p>\n<p>“We’re not driving the market, the market drives us,” Fisher said. “We have to find a product line that will replace the one we already have.”</p>\n<p>Yang said while he will support a UCSB initiative, he still plans to talk to other chancellors to implement similar change on other campuses.</p>\n<p>“I am willing to talk to them, I will be strategically talking to them,” Yang said. “You have more work to do to go to the other students and say ‘we met with our chancellor, have you met with yours?’”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, June 4, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64091\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64091\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/","id":2739,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2738,2737,2736],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Internal Vice President, who acts as President of the Senate, should appoint Senators as Chairs and Vice Chairs of Senate Standing Committees.</p>\n<p>The bill changes the current protocol which allows committees to elect chairs and vice chairs.</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted unanimously to move the bill to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-136-a-bill-to-institutionalize-the-as-innovation-fund/\">A Bill to Institutionalize the A.S.

Innovation Fund, which gathers donations to fund student initiatives. If passed, the bill will establish protocol for the disbursement of donated funds.</p>\n<p>If the bill passes, A.S. Director of Alumni Affairs and A.S. Chief Financial Officer will assist in the stewardship of the A.S. Innovation Fund, and future expenditures from the fund will be recommended by the A.S. President in consultation with the Donor Oversight Committee, then approved by a two-thirds vote in Senate.

Internal Vice President to coordinate a training for all A.S. senators with the Anti-Defamation League by the sixth week of fall quarter.</p>\n<p>The bill builds on the A.S. Resolution to Condemn Anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted unanimously to move the bill to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-145-a-bill-to-update-article-iv-section-1/\">A Bill to Update Article IV Section 1</a>, written by off-campus senator and second-year communications and political science double major Hiro Bower, offers new protocol for when campus organizations funded by lock-in fees end the fiscal year with money left over.</p>\n<p>If the bill passes, funding not rolled over to campus organizations accounts for the next fiscal year will move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee, and distributed to any Office of Student Life (OSL) or A.S. entity “requesting funds for a project or program relevant to the specified language of the lock in.”</p>\n<p>The bill also establishes exceptions to this code, allowing Educational Opportunity Program, KCSB, A.S. Program Board, Communications Personnel, A.S. Recycling, I.V. Improvements, I.V. Tenants Union, the Coastal Fund and the Community Affairs Board automatic rollovers of funds not spent by the end of a fiscal year.</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and second-year CCS physics major Liam Stanton said he was “not a yes” on the bill because he thought unused funds should remain at the discretion of Senate to supplement the A.S. budget.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t appropriate it to OSL from the accounts and just leave it in the general fund, it can be used for whatever and whoever,” Stanton said. “We have to trim money every year off the budget, and if we didn’t allow so many rollovers and we allowed it to roll over into the discretionary funds, I guess we wouldn’t have to trim because the scale at which we trim is way less than the amount of money that is rolled over each year.”</p>\n<p>But College of Letters and Science collegiate senator and fourth-year economics major Nikka Kurland said the bill could ensure students “get what they paid for” with lock-in fees.</p>\n<p>“We’re not like any other business where you need to save money,” Kurland said. “It’s encouraged that a lock-in spends all the money they have within that year, because those students paid for those things for that one year.”</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted to move the bill to old business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-134-a-bill-to-re-envision-the-senate-standing-committees/\">A Bill to Re-envision the Senate Standing Committees</a>, also written by Mancini, would combine the Senate University Affairs Committee and Senate Constitution and By-Laws Committees to form the Campus Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>Mancini said the bill should pass to create a larger committee, which could ensure quorum more often and foster discussion on the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the fact that we are still having joint University Affairs and CBL meetings is indicative of why the bill should pass,” Mancini said. “You do need to have a large group of people to have good discussion on things.”</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted to move the bill to old business.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yang’s office on the fifth floor of Cheadle Hall, issuing a list of demands asking the administration to reform policies and procedures for punishing sexual assault perpetrators and supporting victims.</p>\n<p>At a rally in the Arbor preceding the sit-in, three sexual assault survivors including second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza, first-year art history major Lacy Wright and fourth-year sociology major Melissa Vasquez, shared stories of their experiences, reporting that they had been sexually assaulted to the Office of Judicial Affairs. All three women believe their cases were not given sufficient attention and were handled poorly by university administration.</p>\n<p>A crowd of over 100 students gathered in the Arbor to hear the students speak, and approximately 50 joined them in the sit-in. Yang was not present in his office, so various administrators involved in sexual assault policy heard the demands of the students coordinating the sit-in.</p>\n<p>Vasquez said the perpetrator in her sexual assault case was found guilty by the Santa Barbara County Court of Law, but will still be allowed to walk at his graduation commencement on May 13.</p>\n<p>“He got found guilty by the court of law before we started the school year, and the school knew that, and they still offered him university housing across the street from me,” Vasquez said. “Nine months after the school had known, they only gave him a one-quarter sanction, which was this quarter, and they are still allowing him to graduate next year.”</p>\n<p>Chican@ studies Professor Denise Segura said she is disappointed in how the institution for which she works does not provide services that protect students.</p>\n<p>“One of these students who is in my class came to me and I did what I am supposed to do: I referred her to the right people and these right people did not protect her the way I think she should have been protected,” Segura said. “I am ashamed, ashamed to be a tenured faculty of this institution that allows this to happen and I deeply apologize to these women.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista United Methodist Church Reverend Frank Schaefer said by attempting to silence sexual violence cases and criticism of the administration’s policies, the university will only make the situation worse for all parties involved.</p>\n<p>“We are calling on the administration, on school officials, on faculty members, to please take this very seriously,” Schaefer said. “Sweeping things under the rug is never going to be good for the future and if you wanted to address this issue and correct it and restore justice and security for students and any member of this community, you need to face this issue head on.”</p>\n<p>The students demanded mandatory educational workshops on consent and relationships, increased diversity in the Judicial Affairs staff, increased funding to train support staff for sexual assault survivors, free mental health services for survivors, better handling of sexual assault cases, monetary compensation for survivors in past cases that have been mishandled, immediate suspension for more than two quarters and bans on housing, employment and other privileges for convicted perpetrators, among other demands.<br>\nVasquez said she wanted UCSB to instate a minimum penalty for students found guilty of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“There is not a minimum consequence for those convicted of sexual assault, it could be a one-quarter suspension,” Vasquez said. “One or two quarters have been the most a student has gotten.”</p>\n<p>According to Vasquez, UCSB currently has harsher penalties for plagiarism than for sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“There is a minimum penalty for plagiarism, but there is no minimum penalty for sexual assault,” Vasquez said. “What’s that say about how they value women or people in general, what do you value about our bodies, what do you value about us, our tuition?”</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major and Gaucho Consent Coordinator Alexa Weyrick said the sit-in is a community effort to change sexual misconduct policies at the university.</p>\n<p>“For example, if a perpetrator is found guilty, they are not immediately suspended,” Weyrick said. “They’re allowed to finish off their quarter, which is disgusting.”<br>\nMelgoza said she wants administration to follow through on the no-contact order brought against her perpetrator.</p>\n<p>“He has been spotted on campus again, and I sent an email about that as well,” Melgoza said. “I want that immediately fixed. I cannot believe that I won, quote unquote, my case and yet he has been spotted on campus various times.”</p>\n<p>Acting Associate Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services and Campus Compliance Officer Pam Lombardo said the UC system has already taken steps to improve how sexual assault cases are handled by forming a Subcommittee on Sexual Violence.</p>\n<p>“I know it doesn’t move fast enough for you, but we are looking at minimum sanctions for different kinds of events, assaults, and I think the area has come to our attention and we are moving as quick as we can, which is sometimes very slow in the scheme of things,” Lombardo said.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean for Student Life Debbie Fleming said administrators have already discussed implementing some of the policies the sit-in demands, such as mandatory preventative education.</p>\n<p>“Several of the things on the list we already have in place so it would be an opportunity for us to talk with students about it, helping them understand what we already have in place,” Fleming said. “We were already just having a conversation in there about some of our mandatory education and we would like to get student input into getting it more effective.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said the process to sanction sexual assault offenders needs to be faster in order to allow survivors to heal and focus on their lives as students.</p>\n<p>“How am I going to focus on my studies and my education if I keep seeing my perpetrator every single day?” Melgoza said. “My perpetrator was supposed to be suspended this spring, yet he is here.”</p>\n<p>Vasquez said she and three other sexual assault survivors demand funding for transportation and board to travel to the next Board of Regents meeting on May 20 and speak to UC President Janet Napolitano and Governor Jerry Brown in public forum.</p>\n<p>“They’re meeting in a couple weeks, so we want traveling funds for that and also to have a spot to speak because Governor Jerry Brown and Janet Napolitano do show up but they walk out on comments,” Vasquez said.</p>\n<p>According to Vasquez, students participating in the sit-in demand a meeting with Yang and financial compensation for the hardships they have experienced at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We won’t leave until we have a written notice that we will meet with him at a date and time,” Vasquez said. “I would also like a written notice of my tuition reimbursement before I leave.”</p>\n<p>Vasquez said the group demands further sanctions on the academic privileges of students convicted of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I also want the school to develop an education intervention program for those who are found guilty of sexual assault, and they are not allowed to receive their degree until that process is done” Vasquez said. “Being a Gaucho is an honor, and that should not be given to offenders of sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>Vasquez also said administrators should go through mandatory “sensitivity training” to be better prepared to aid students who report sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“It’s very unfair these responses coming especially from women,” Vasquez said. “Telling us that it was ‘bad sex,’ and that we ‘need to get over it,’ and that ‘how should they have known that’s not what we wanted?’”</p>\n<p>Weyrick said the administrative efforts to address sexual violence need to work to include students.</p>\n<p>“Me and Alejandra only sit on the Sexual Violence Subcommittee because we heard about it through Ali Guthy since we’re execs in Take Back the Night,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>“Students aren’t able to lend a voice; it’s a bunch of administrators sitting in a room.”</p>\n<p>Fleming said she hopes a small group of representatives from the sit-in will have an opportunity to speak with Yang about the list of demands, but that he was “on the road” and difficult to reach.</p>\n<p>“At this point they would very much like to meet with the Chancellor face to face,” Fleming said. “I’m hoping that can be scheduled. We’re having a little bit of a problem reaching him.”</p>\n<p>Segura said she hopes Yang listens to the sit-in’s demands and takes initiative on speeding the process to implement better policy.</p>\n<p>“The Chancellor has a chance to be a leader rather than just react,” Segura said. “We already know what needs to be done. We already know what’s right. We already know these things.

It also includes $436 million over the next three years to reduce UC’s pension liability. A tuition freeze would be contingent on the UC Board of Regents lowing its pension ceiling and establishing benefit plans for certain employees in accordance with the 2013 Public Employees Pension Reform Act.</p>\n<p>UC plans to further increase revenue by raising the Student Service Fee by five percent annually and, if approved at the May 21 meeting of the UC Board of Regents, increase out-of-state tuition by eight percent annually. The budget will go to the state legislature for consideration.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said Brown has acknowledged the importance of UC education by agreeing to the budget revisions.</p>\n<p>“With this agreement, the Governor has recognized the need to reinvest in UC as well as the imperative to provide students, their families and the University with a reliable way to budget for the cost of a UC education,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Communications Director for the A.S. Lobby Corps and first-year art history major Lacy Wright said she supports the proposed increase to the Student Services Fee, because UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is in need of better funding.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. works so incredibly hard to help all the students seeking counseling, but just doesn’t have the funds,” Wright said. “Students often have to wait weeks to see a counselor, and this wait could be drastically shortened with the increase in funds.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major Mohsin Mirza said while Student Service Fee provides important services, students should not have to bear so much of the financial burden.</p>\n<p>“The services fee will go to programs that are very helpful and necessary, like increased funding for mental health services so C.A.P.S. can hire more practitioners,” Mirza said. “It’s incredibly important, but unfortunate that, once again, it’ll be students who, across the state, already are struggling financially, who will have to be picking up the tab rather than the state.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63462\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63462\" data-attachment-id=\"63462\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/budgetproposal-to-freeze-in-state-tuition-provide-more-program-funds/brown_budget-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416399737\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brown_Budget-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63462\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Daily Nexus File Photo\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Mirza said the proposed increase to out-of-state tuition is “unfortunate” because it will exclude many people of lower economic classes from attending a UC.</p>\n<p>“Out-of-state students are already extremely financially burdened, and I worry that this latest increase will mean that only the wealthiest out-of-state students will continue to afford to be here.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, Prop 13 reform and UC budget transparency can help eliminate future “tuition battles.”</p>\n<p>“These are the big changes we need, and the only way I can foresee that happening is if we can build a stronger student movement over the next two years,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said the budget revision will not accommodate UC’s desired increase in enrollment.</p>\n<p>“It does not fund California student enrollment growth — so our work is not done,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to a statement from the UC Students Association (UCSA), UCSA President Jefferson Kuoch-Seng said while May Revise is an important step, students should continue pushing for lower tuition.</p>\n<p>“Today’s announcement contains promising news for California UC undergraduates,” Kuoch-Seng said. “However, students will continue our direct advocacy in Sacramento and build broad support across California within and beyond our campuses.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he is “cautiously optimistic” UC will use new state funding efficiently.</p>\n<p>“The UC has a history of mismanaging funds, it was a key reason as to why Prop 30 failed to have the impact we had hoped it would,” Mirza said. “I know students will be doing their best to hold them accountable.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

CFO Andre Theus (right), listen to funding requests from campus organizations Monday evening. <em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associate Students Finance and Business Committee met Monday in the UCen’s State Street Room to hear funding requests from five campus organizations, two of which it granted.</p>\n<p>The committee heard requests with approximately $4,000 allocated for Culture Weeks and Graduation and no further funding available, according to Chief Financial Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus. Pilipino Graduation (P-Grad), Hermanas Unidas, the University Center (UCen) and the Persian Student Group all requested funding, and Black Graduation (Black Grad) requested reallocation of previously granted funds. The committee granted P-Grad and Black Grad’s requests.</p>\n<p>Black Grad representative Jasmine Moses requested the $3,250 the committee previously granted the organization to fund a keynote speaker be reallocated for degree covers, paper to print certificates, flowers, a cake, UCen catering services, use of Campbell hall, a balloon arch and cocktail tables.</p>\n<p>According to Moses, the organization had to request reallocation because university policy prohibits private groups from paying faculty members to speak at graduation events.</p>\n<p>“Our speaker is a faculty member, hence we can’t pay a faculty member to speak at graduation,” Moses said.</p>\n<p>The committee reallocated $2,300 of Black Grad’s funding and suggested the group request further reallocations at a later meeting.</p>\n<p>P-Grad requested $2,570 to fund a dinner for 23 graduates and their guests, a speaker and transportation for the organization’s graduation event.</p>\n<p>A P-Grad representative said the organization has been fundraising, but would like help from the committee.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of fundraisers this quarter,” the representative said. “We had one last week and we have two more, so we are trying to fund programs ourselves, so it would just be a big help.”<br>\nThe committee granted P-Grad’s request.</p>\n<p>The UCen requested $700 to fund labor for UStudy Center, the UCen’s extended hours and services during dead week and finals week.</p>\n<p>According to a UCen representative, the UStudy center needs a service manager and service assistant on shift earning $10 per hour from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. to oversee special services throughout the UCen property, such as review sessions and free massages.</p>\n<p>“In order to be able to do this for our students, we need to be able to have our staff here at that time,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>The committee denied the UCen’s request.</p>\n<p>Hermanas Unidas representative Julia Ostromogilskaya requested $1,042 to purchase catering service for an estimated 70 to 100 people, furniture, a piñata and other supplies for the organization’s annual “Carne Asada con La Raza” cultural event.</p>\n<p>Ostromogilskaya said the event would include discussion on cultural appropriation surrounding Cinco de Mayo, even though the holiday has passed.</p>\n<p>“It’s usually a little closer to Cinco de Mayo,” Ostromogilskaya said. “This year since it’s after we’re still going to reference it and talk about Cinco de Mayo and its actual history and cultural appropriation and what that is and how people within the community feel about it.”</p>\n<p>Financial officer and second-year political science major Izzy Ninh said the $500 the organization budgeted for food was excessive.</p>\n<p>“I would love for us to make that happen; however, I think spending $500 on food for 70 people is a lot,” Ninh said.</p>\n<p>The committee denied Hermanas Unidas’ request.</p>\n<p>Persian Student Group representative and third-year psychology major Leilani Riahi requested $1,000 to fund a catered dinner for an estimated 200 people after the group’s annual Persian Cultural Show this Thursday at the MultiCultural Center Theater.</p>\n<p>Riahi said the organization would plan an alternative gathering if it cannot fund a catered dinner.</p>\n<p>“We usually do dinner, but if we don’t get the money we could always do Persian sweets and tea,” Riahi said.</p>\n<p>Financial officer Austin Kang said the committee should not fund the group out of funds allocated for Culture Weeks and Graduation because they are not planning an event as part of a culture week.</p>\n<p>“If it’s not part of a weeklong event or if it’s just like a one-day celebration, it shouldn’t come out of Culture and Grad,” Kang said. “I looked at the Legal Code, and it said it was for cultural, weeklong events.”</p>\n<p>The committee denied Persian Culture Group’s request.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The bill’s current language circumvents the LAFCO process by stating the CSD and its funding mechanism, a Utility Users Tax (UUT), will be ratified by a vote of its potential residents.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor and LAFCO Vice Chair Doreen Farr and public comment participants spoke in favor of AB 3, while other commissioners said it does not sufficiently clarify the role of UC Santa Barbara, the CSD’s boundaries and the district’s financial feasibility, especially for funding special approval elections.</p>\n<p>Long term I.V. resident and UCSB Economics Lecturer Lanney Ebenstein said he has lived in I.V. since 1961 and, despite the costs, believes a CSD is the “best opportunity” for I.V. he has seen in his time in the community.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista has unique issues — both as board compensation and funding — that make state legislation necessary,” Ebenstein said. “There is no question that it would be an expense to the county, but, in the long run, I believe it is very much to the County of Santa Barbara’s financial benefit to see that there is an Isla Vista Community Services District.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Associate Student Government Senator and I.V. resident Ethan Bertrand said SBCC A.S. unanimously voted to support AB 3, and he is in favor of a parking district to better manage parking in the streets of I.V. and monitor I.V. visitors.</p>\n<p>“A parking district as included in AB 3 would allow more control for who can park in Isla Vista, which would help regulate out-of-towners and just bring more order to our streets,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Roger Aceves said a parking district can be established through Santa Barbara County and does not require AB 3.</p>\n<p>“This thing about the parking district — the county can do that,” Aceves said.</p>\n<p>SBCC trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he is not unwilling to form a CSD through LAFCO, but feels some members of the board would oppose the bill regardless of whether it went through the LAFCO process or not.</p>\n<p>“I just personally get the feeling that LAFCO is going to oppose AB 3 CSD whether we include LAFCO in the process or not,” Abboud said. “I’m getting the feeling from comments that your [LAFCO’s] board members have already said in public that this will not pass, regardless, so including you in the process almost seems like a moot point, because to include you would be to kill the bill at a later date.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said LAFCO and Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative should work together to focus on the main problem of addressing I.V.’s community needs instead of opposing each other’s ideas.</p>\n<p>“Just take a step back and look at [what] the problem we are really trying to solve is, which is the safety and welfare of residents in Isla Vista,” Abboud said. “We could just negotiate and work in good faith together without any preconceived notion of what should happen in Isla Vista and focus on what the residents think should happen … instead of coming up with your own idea of blocking the ideas of people who have been working on it for years.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Louis Mariano said he does not see a purpose in including LAFCO, because the commission consistently opposes the bill.</p>\n<p>“Last Tuesday, we did discuss including LAFCO in the process, but if you oppose the bill, why would we want to bring you into the discussion furtherly?” Mariano said. “We do want to bring you in on the implementation of the CSD, but if you really oppose it, there’s really no point because you’re not going to want the CSD to succeed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Izeah Garcia said the bill should not face opposition because it is representative of the needs of many I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s illogical to oppose or question this movement, because it’s a grassroots movement, and there has been information gathered across the board with regards to Latino families, students and even individuals who own houses in Isla Vista,” Garcia said. “We’ve been working for this for many hours and many weeks and this is a collective effort.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD­) Board Member Jacob Lebell said I.V needs representatives that would work with Santa Barbara County, UCSB and law enforcement to solve larger issues on behalf of the community.</p>\n<p>“Other entities such as the county, UCSB and the police need to have representatives of our community that they can talk to, negotiate and partner with to really address the large number of problems that our community is facing,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>Lebell said while he believes LAFCO members can potentially contribute to the CSD plan, their uncompromising attitude discourages him from wanting to work with them.</p>\n<p>“I do understand your concerns about AB 3 circumventing the LAFCO process,” Lebell said. “I think you all have value to add to it, but I would just like to make you aware that a lot of my fellow residents are quite frankly afraid of you.”</p>\n<p>I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman said the lack of sales tax and a transient occupancy tax in AB 3 is concerning for business owners, and the Utility Users Tax is the only tax item left in the bill.</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Downtown Business Association has been meeting recently, and one of the things that has come up there is that Utility Users Tax is the only tax that is left in the bill,” Freeman said. “The sales tax and the transient occupancy tax has been removed, and that’s a concern amongst business owners because it affects businesses.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he supports I.V. self-governance but does not think AB 3 will be a sufficient foundation without intervention from LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“The boundaries for the university are confusing,” Freeman said. “This is one of the many reasons why I have continued to believe that LAFCO should be involved.”</p>\n<p>LAFCO Vice-chair Craig Geyer said amendments to AB 3 address issues from LAFCO’s Feb. 19 letter of concern, such as board makeup and district boundaries, but the ad hoc committee on the bill still wants to see an amendment stating the CSD formation will go through LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“I think, at the end of the day, the consensus from the ad hoc committee was basically we should maintain an opposed position unless the motion comes back through local LAFCO,” Geyer said.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Roger Welt said he sees progress in the amendments to AB 3 thus far and hopes Williams’ office will “keep up the good work,” but is not ready to support the bill without further clarification on the role of UCSB and funding for proposed elections.</p>\n<p>“You are starting to fill in the blanks,” Welt said. “I think there’s a couple things that are still hanging out there that give me reason to wait on this a little bit further.”</p>\n<p>Commissioner Janet Wolf also said AB 3 was making progress in clarifying the questions posed in the letter.</p>\n<p>“In our letter of opposition, we did get the chance to specify what some of our issues were,” Welt said. “This bill is moving forward — a lot of those questions are being answered, such as the makeup of the board and the boundaries”</p>\n<p>Commissioner Steve Lavagnino said he feels Santa Barbara County provides adequate services to I.V making AB 3 unnecessary and insulting.</p>\n<p>“I guess we take it a little personally — at least I do — on the Board of Supervisors when people say they are not getting the services they need in an unincorporated area,” Lavagino said. “The county’s really stepping up and providing a level of service that you might not see in a lot of other areas.”</p>\n<p>Welt said the lack of information on the proposed CSD’s financial feasibility limits the commission’s support of AB 3.</p>\n<p>“I really believe in the power of that feasibility study,” Welt said. “Finance is really important here, and the feasibility study might flush that out.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said he agrees with Lavagino that supporters of AB 3 take county services for granted.</p>\n<p>“I agree with Commissioner Lavagino,” Aceves said. “I would take offense to that, because a lot of money spent is providing the necessary services, but now we’re asking to add additional taxes.”</p>\n<p>But Farr said I.V. needs more services than the county can provide, and a CSD with a UUT would create the needed funding.</p>\n<p>“In looking at all the things the CSD wants to do, I could go down every one of them and tell you how we have tried and continue to try to find the money to support so many of these,” Farr said. “Without a dedicated source of funding for Isla Vista, the county is not going to be able to keep up with what it needs”</p>\n<p>Lavagino said LAFCO should not support AB 3 until a financial feasibility study is complete.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think any of us in any of our jurisdictions will move forward on anything without finding out first if it makes financial sense,” Lavagino said. “The only way we can do that is with a feasibility study.”</p>\n<p>Lavagino said he fears student proponents of AB 3 are unrealistic in their support of the bill.</p>\n<p>“I feel like these young people are well-intentioned and maybe have been sold something they feel is a panacea,” Lavagino said. “If this thing goes down the road … my fear is, down that road, you’re going to be looking five years after the CSD is there and saying ‘Wow I don’t see a whole heck of a lot that’s different.’”</p>\n<p>According to Aceves, only a city or county can impose a Utility Users Tax, meaning a CSD imposing a UUT in I.V. would require additional legislation.</p>\n<p>“How can this bill authorize a special district to it, because that is, in my mind, concerning, because every special district in the county would want to take advantage of that if they could.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said LAFCO is not impeding the CSD formation process as many AB 3 supporters suggested, but rather doing their job.</p>\n<p>“We are legislatively required to follow the law,” Aceves said. “It’s what we have to do as a Local Agency Formation Commission for the orderly development of special districts or cities, and this one doesn’t even want to talk to us.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said he was concerned AB 3 allows 10 years for I.V. residents to approve a UUT by a two-thirds vote.</p>\n<p>“What are these board members going to do for ten years with no money?” Aceves said.</p>\n<p>Moorhouse also said he was concerned about the bill’s establishment of a 10-year period for approval of the tax.</p>\n<p>“We could actually have an election every year,” Moorhouse said. “Tens upon tens of thousands of dollars could be spent.”</p>\n<p>Commissioner Bob Orach said he thinks the proposed CSD should better incorporate IVRPD.</p>\n<p>“It would seem to me that the CSD having that power and authority — those local officials that are concerned about their parks and recreation — why wouldn’t they be included?” Orach said.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Jeff Moorhouse said AB 3 should follow the LAFCO process in order to form a long-term solution for I.V., and it is important to include larger I.V. entities, such as UCSB, in the self-governance process.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to do this the right way and do the process the way it should be done, so when change is made, it’s sustainable and will last for generations,” Moorhouse said. “I don’t think that’s gonna happen until you get some of the major players participating. UCSB has been one of the entities that has helped create this disadvantaged community. We need to get UCSB to the table.”</p>\n<p>Moorhouse said AB 3 takes away local power by allowing the state legislature to mandate county-level elections.</p>\n<p>“In the language that is currently proposed, it states that the County of Santa Barbara is going to put it on the ballot,” Moorhouse said. “We are being told by the state legislature that we are going to expend thousands upon thousands of dollars for an election.”</p>\n<p>Geyer said Williams should amend AB 3 to include LAFCO in the CSD establishment process.</p>\n<p>“What I support is opposing this bill until it’s amended to include the formation of the proposed district through the local LAFCO,” Geyer said. “Most of the questions — district boundary, financial feasibility — that would all be vetted through our normal LAFCO process”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO should have used more positive language in its initial stance on the bill.</p>\n<p>“This is an opportunity to try to do something, finally, for Isla Vista,” Farr said. “If LAFCO initially had taken a position of ‘support if amended,’ as opposed to ‘opposed unless amended,’ even though they seem to be two sides of the same coin, I think the import is much different.”</p>\n<p>Fox also said LAFCO should take a more supportive stance of AB 3 while voicing concerns about potential issues.</p>\n<p>“We need to take ‘unless amended’ out of there for some more positive words that say ‘we’re here to help you as an organization of LAFCOs,” Fox said.</p>\n<p>Wolf also said LAFCO should help the I.V. self-governance movement and motioned that the commission support AB 3 if amended.</p>\n<p>“I think we should take an affirmative stance,” Wolf said. “I think we should support this bill and make recommendations for amendments and/or clarifications.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said LAFCO should not support the bill until members are satisfied with its language and made a substitute motion to oppose the bill unless amended to include LAFCO in the CSD formation.</p>\n<p>“The amendment will include specifics,” Aceves said. “One: that they go through LAFCO, and two: that they have a feasibility study.”</p>\n<p>Aceves’ motion passed in a five-to-two vote, with only Farr and Wolf voting against it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/lafco-opposes-ab-3-calls-for-amendments/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/lafco-opposes-ab-3-calls-for-amendments/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/lafco-opposes-ab-3-calls-for-amendments/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/lafco-opposes-ab-3-calls-for-amendments/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/lafco-opposes-ab-3-calls-for-amendments/","id":4703,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[4702,4701,4700],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Food Co-op Outreach and Education Coordinator Ashley Audycki said the Co-op wanted to host a potluck at the Pardall Center, and the meeting attendees decided the dinner should take place May 25.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and linguistics major and IVTU Vice President Alexandra Meallet said there should be forums for open discussion surrounding the series of memorial events.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s still a time when we’re becoming more comfortable with speaking about it [the May 23 tragedy] and I think open group discussion is pretty healthy,” Meallet said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Pardall Center staff member Natalie Dimas said her sorority Sigma Alpha Zeta has been discussing arranging a Zumba class if they could secure funding and coordinate with the Pardall Center staff.</p>\n<p>“Dancing can relieve stress and it is a method of coping,” Dimas said. “I’ve been looking around and seeing if I could find a Zumba instructor that would provide the class at a reduced price, if anything.”</p>\n<p>Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) Director Jeanne Stanford said it is important to remember individuals cope with tragedy in different ways and to be respectful of other’s methods if they differ from your own.</p>\n<p>“I am aware of people who don’t want to hear anything else about it … and then there’s people that want to remember it,” Stanford said. “Whether you want to turn away from it or you want to delve into it, we shouldn’t be judging each other.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said C.A.P.S. staff will be available for anyone who wants to talk about the events of May 23 last year, but will not push their services on anyone who does not approach them.</p>\n<p>“We are not saying that anybody needs counseling,” Stanford said. “We didn’t do that last year, because we had just drop-in consultation, because it was an unusual event.”</p>\n<p>Audycki said she thinks local art stores would be willing to help provide craft supplies for an artistic-themed event to commemorate the tragedy and help students heal.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be really therapeutic for some people to be able to create with something that could’ve been destroyed,” Audycki said.</p>\n<p>Puentes said one goal of the memorial events is to tailor them to the variety of ways that students can cope with last year’s tragedy and find healing through community.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we are trying to do is help people access a lot of different ways to be involved, whether it’s more actively or passively,” Puentes said. “We definitely want to make sure that we have mental health and counselling services available to people in a place that is in the community.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said the memorial events will provide an opportunity to honor the students lost and restore faith in humanity.</p>\n<p>“Naturally, as human beings, we remember what happened,” Stanford said. “What we’re doing with remembrances and anniversary events are about community and about restoring people’s faith in humanity.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/","id":4726,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[4725,4724,4723],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senators listen to funding requests from student organizations. <em>Alexander Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met yesterday in the State Street Room in the University Center to hear funds requests from eight student organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to partially fund one organization, table two requests indefinitely, recommend one organization to seek funding from senate and not fund four requests. They started the meeting with $12,009 in the culture weeks and graduation fund, $3,196 in the senate unallocated fund, and zero dollars in all other funds including the sports teams, OSL and Student Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP) funds.</p>\n<p>The Committee indefinitely tabled decisions on the Geography Club, which requested $260, and the Pacific Island Student Association, which requested $5228, because their representatives were not present.</p>\n<p>Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion y Revolucion (M.U.J.E.R.), an advocacy group for Chicana and Latina students, requested $3,006.60 for the food and venue for their annual MUJERcitas conference, which has brought in around 150 high school girls each of the past three years.</p>\n<p>Committee chairman and third-year history of public policy Jimmy Villarreal said the committee had to deny M.U.J.E.R. of all funding, because their request would come out of SIOP.</p>\n<p>UCSB Cycling Team president Richard Lo requested $1,000 from Finance Board to offset the cost of airfare to road nationals, as the team has been unable to get funding from other sources.</p>\n<p>“We are looking to send four men and three women to road nationals in May,” Lo said. “We have already looked at rec sports and other external funding, but we haven’t gotten any.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said the committee had no money to grant the team.</p>\n<p>“We are zeroed out of our sports funds, but we will discuss if we can find any other source,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>The Film Studio requested $500 for purchasing food, a red carpet and rental of I.V. Theater for their upcoming annual festival.</p>\n<p>“We are currently organizing our fifth annual Santa Barbara Digital Film Festival,” the representative said. “The event is open to the entire campus. Anyone can submit.”</p>\n<p>The committee motioned to deny the Studio all requested funds and suggest they take their request to senate.</p>\n<p>The Pink Research Link, which encourages UCSB students to take interest in breast cancer research, requested $75 to help recruit new members using flyers.</p>\n<p>“It is already a small club, and it is mostly made up of the officers, which are either graduating or studying abroad next year,” the representative said. “We are really looking to recruit new students, because recently we have made a lot of progress in what we have been able to do for breast cancer awareness.”</p>\n<p>The committee denied the club’s request, but committee advisor Cindy Lopez suggested they request the $250 startup, which they would be guaranteed to receive if they meet the basic criteria.</p>\n<p>The Japanese Language Café (JLC) requested $280 for food and drinks for their quarterly potluck and karaoke party, which is historically their biggest event, but the committee denied their request.</p>\n<p>According to Villarreal, the committee’s shrinking budget restricted all of their decisions.</p>\n<p>“We are getting toward the end of the year, so we’re low on funds now,” Villarreal said. “We allocated them to all the different student groups and we’ve had a lot of nice events.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62377\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62377\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/","id":2818,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2817,2816,2815],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Committee to Erect I.V.

The committee discussed specific details of the various event and art installation ideas, and members said they hope to see their plans come to fruition in the weeks surrounding the May 23 tragedy’s anniversary.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy opened the meeting by restating the special committee’s objective to plan an event that reflects the student body and I.V. community’s needs.</p>\n<p>“I really want this to be something community-generated, something that feels organic and that the community would want to see happen,” Guthy said. “It shouldn’t be something that’s official or that we need to do just because we should. It’s whatever’s right for us.”</p>\n<p>Guthy told the committee that A.S. would help with a candlelight vigil on May 23 which she said will be similar to the vigil A.S. hosted in the days following last year’s tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Associated Students is interested in helping to facilitate a memorial walk/candlelight vigil like we did last year,” Guthy said. “That is one of the events that I personally would like to attend and see as a member of the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the Surf Club will likely help with a memorial paddle-out similar to last year’s, which would take place sometime during the week after the anniversary.</p>\n<p>“We’ve spoken with Surf Club, who hosted that last year, and they’ve expressed interest in hosting another one,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board Commissioner and fourth-year global studies major Benjamin Simons said the board would be able to provide logistical support for the May 23 vigil.</p>\n<p>“We would like to help really put on the vigil,” Simon said. “We will be providing our sound system like we did last time and security like we did last time.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould encouraged A.S. to end the walk at Perfect Park, because IVRPD will be dedicating a memorial garden there on May 16.</p>\n<p>“We could have a stage or speakers at the end to incorporate the memorial garden,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>Spatial Studies Professor in the art department Professor Kim Yasuda said there will likely be an art installation in Perfect Park if A.S. and the art department can gather funds to commission Bamboo DNA Founder Gerard Minakawa, who has designed structures for music festivals such as Burning Man and Coachella, to create something for the anniversary memorial.</p>\n<p>“[He] is very interested in contributing his artistic ability … to do something appropriate that would be an illuminated structure,” Yasuda said. “Our goal is that it would be the start of a structure or even a sculpture in that park and that it becomes kind of a centerpiece.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said members of the art department are collaborating on a concept of a blue LED-lit pathway from campus to I.V. that would line the silent walk portion of the May 23 vigil and create a “collective force.”</p>\n<p>“I think a concept that would be really powerful would be if we started to light things in May and then people, businesses, community members started contributing to this blue light,” Yasuda said. “Then, by the 23rd, it’s kind of an experiment in how people build solidarity.”</p>\n<p>The art department is exploring ways to allow individual students to place the LED lights, so students who cannot or choose not to participate in the vigil can express support for the remembrance events, according to Yasuda.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to get all stakeholders contributing something together,” said Yasuda. “If we started in May, it could accumulate by social media.”</p>\n<p>Education and Outreach Coordinator at UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program and alumnus Marjan Riazi said the C.A.P.S. clinical staff will make themselves available at the vigil to support students in need of their services.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the clinical staff would be happy to be there as emergency first responders for people who are triggered,” Riazi said.</p>\n<p>Guthy said the committee is still making decisions on how they will use university emails and social media to publicize the events once plans are finalized.<br>\n“We want to get the information out — at least about the dates — sooner rather than later,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
