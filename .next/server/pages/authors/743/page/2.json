In the vague tweets that followed, she talked about conveying “sincerity, honesty, and empathy” in her art and foreshadowed the start of a solo career. The Canadian duo, comprised of Glass and (former) counterpart Ethan Kath had been together since 2004. Since then, the group has released a number of albums, experimenting with fast-paced synthesized chiptune and warped vocals, which gained them a sizeable cult following over the years.</p>\n<p>Here are five reasons to be thankful that the Crystal Castles ever existed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Alice Glass is a total badass.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Female performers are no strangers to the handsy male “fans” in their audience (see also: Courtney Love, Iggy Azalea, etc.). When a guy in the crowd at Latitude Festival in the UK allegedly touched her breast in 2010 while the songstress was crowd-surfing, Glass was not passive about it. Instead, she contemptuously started punching and spitting on the offender.

In an interview with a Japanese magazine in 2008, he said that he had wanted to make the song “XXZXCUZX ME” sound “grating” on purpose. When asked why, Kath responded, “To weed out the wimps, annoy the posers. We are saying, ‘we are not for you.’” That may sound harsh but you almost can’t help but respect his brash honesty.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>They themselves have great taste (and showcase it).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Is there anything better than knowing you and somebody you like share similar taste? There are probably lots of better things, but that’s still a satisfying feeling, and Crystal Castles teamed up with their musical favorites, who coincidentally happened to be ours. In 2010 Crystal Castles released “Not In Love,” their collaboration with The Cure’s Robert Smith, letting us know that, not only are they awesome, they also must have pretty awesome taste. The track sounds eerily reminiscent of a The Cure song backed with tantalizing electronic basslines and dance hooks. And who could forget their cameo in the UK TV show, “Skins?” The band was featured performing their song “Alice Practice” in the background of some underground club while Sid told Tony his father had passed. Cue the emotions.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Their live shows are insane.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although I’ve only had the experience of attending their live show once, I can tell you that it’s more of a riot than a concert. The crowd itself started off tamer than the band, but by the first or second song, the band’s wild and facetious attitude rubbed off on everyone in the room. Okay, maybe not everyone (event security is usually not digging it). Kath and Glass’s synergy onstage makes for an oddly-balanced stage presence. Kath, the calmer of the two, provided the beat on his drums or keyboard in the background, while Glass could be seen climbing and jumping on every possible surface, regularly shouting her lines from atop the drum kit or speakers or from within the audience. Through all this, the crowd entered a volatile, if not slightly dangerous, state of sheer passion and chaos.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>They provided the perfect outlet for your pent-up teenage angst.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re reading this, chances are the years of your adolescence overlapped perfectly with Crystal Castle’s ten-year life span. Coupled with static-y beats replete with energy and aggression, the songs’ lyrics are often lost amongst the white noise of it all. It can be easy to forget or overlook the fact that there are meaningful lyrics which convey themes about love, human emotions and social and political oppression. The song “Plague” opens with the lines “I need you pure, I need you clean,” tapping into the emotional pain and conflict that often accompanies growing older and breaking out of the social concept of “purity”. The song also features lyrics like, “Don’t try to enlighten me. Power to misconstrue / What have they done to you,” referencing corruptive realities imposed on youths, masquerading as what’s normal and accepted in society while also contributing to the loss of purity.</p>\n<p>There will never be another band quite like Crystal Castles, but rather than mourn their deterioration, it is important to celebrate and appreciate their contribution to music as well as the lives of countless fans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/JxVm2_ojQtkframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/JxVm2_ojQtk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57727\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57727\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/rock-in-paradise-five-reasons-were-really-gonna-miss-crystal-castles/","id":7651,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[7650,7649,7648],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Audience Hungers for More Hall & Oates at the Santa Barbara Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I arrived at the Santa Barbara Bowl as people were trickling into their seats, just in time to catch the opener.

His name was Mutlu, and he set the tone for the night with soulful love songs accompanied by rhythmic guitar. A few times he made me giggle, and I blushed from lyrics like “Caramelize me baby / Rub me in nougat from my head to my feet / Caramelize me baby / You know that daddy’s gotta eat.”</p>\n<p>The last few people were just finding their seats as the rest of the crowd anxiously waited in the dark amphitheater when the headliners finally appeared. Daryl Hall took center stage, his platinum feathered hair swept back, revealing sunglasses that he left on for the whole show. Wearing a black button-down shirt with white hemlines and a matching suit jacket, Hall looked pretty snazzy to say the least. To his left stood his counterpart, John Oates, wearing a sleek, all-black ensemble. A funky tune started playing, which I recognized as the intro to the song “Maneater,” and within seconds the crowd was on their feet and waving their arms. After the first song, Hall greeted the crowd with a standard, “Good to see you guys.” He mumbled, “We haven’t been here in a long time,” leading to an indecipherable contemplation with John on exactly how long it’s been. In the end they couldn’t decide.</p>\n<p>The eclectic crowd was composed of everyone from veteran fans to college-aged hipsters, all similarly eager to see Hall &amp; Oates perform. Together they conjured an odor that was the trifecta of weed, beer and the fresh woodsy air from the nature surrounding the stadium. It was my first time at the Santa Barbara Bowl and I was taken aback by its beauty, regularly glancing around to fully take in my surroundings. I happened to spot a middle-aged crew almost get busted by security for lighting a joint. In a way that instance encapsulated the overall vibe for the night. No real binary existed between the old and the young, and in truth the “older” crowd was the rowdiest of the bunch, as if the roles were to be reversed.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The seven-piece band consisted of guitar, drums, keyboard, saxophone, chimes, flute and vocals. Having gone to many EDM shows recently, I was very aware that every sound emitted from the stage was made live by the people in front of me. I was careful not to take that fact for granted, since it’s become somewhat of a rarity in what we consider “live” music. Hall’s vocals impressively hit every note attempted, and when mixed with Oates’ voice the outcome was rich and soulful.</p>\n<p>Saxophone player Charles “Mr. Casual” DeChant was a vision in his sterling silver suit, turquoise blue shoes and silver elbow-length hair. I was smitten. His passionate sax solos stole the show on several occasions, most notably during “It Isn’t So,” and an extra loud cheer could be heard throughout the entire stadium whenever he took center stage. Towards the end of the show, Hall traded his guitar for a keyboard during “Do What You Want, Be What You Are.” He played the keyboard with equal parts skill and vivacity, and I noticed lines of people spilling into the front seating area. By the end of the song, a mass of fans surrounded the stage, swaying in unison.</p>\n<p>Hall &amp; Oates left the stage prematurely at approximately 9:10 p.m., but came back out to appease screaming fans. They didn’t disappoint with two of their most famous hits: “Rich Girl” and “You Make My Dreams Come True.” When the lights went out a second time, the insatiable and inebriated audience was still not satisfied and a sizeable crowd pooled at the edge of the stage.</p>\n<p>The duo returned with another banger, “Kiss on My List,” and the show ended when Hall thanked the crowd for coming out. He also made sure to call attention to his TV show, “Live From Daryl’s House,” which features himself and fellow musicians cooking, eating and jamming at Hall’s home in New York.</p>\n<p>Seeing Daryl Hall and John Oates live in concert was certainly a unique experience, and one I will fondly reminisce on the next time I hear their songs come on my favorite oldies radio station.</p>\n<p>To check

of the young prodigal DJ who goes by XXYYXX (real name, Marcel Everett) last Thursday, Oct. 16 at The Observatory in Santa Ana.</p>\n<p>Everett released his self-titled debut album in 2012 at age 16. The album was an experiment with electronic synths to make slow, chilled-out and repetitive melodies (a friendly policeman once described it to me as “mellow, relaxing jazz”), using samples from artists like Amy Winehouse and Alt-J. When I first heard his music a few years ago, it completely reconstructed my perceptions of electronic music and what this genre was capable of.</p>\n<p>Of course, this was an album he put out years ago, and since artists are perpetually growing and evolving I couldn’t expect his current show to be completely true to his past style. He played an eclectic mix featuring slow-vibe, trap-infused hip-hop remixes at some points and faster, heavier drumbeats at others, alternating and experimenting between the two styles.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This was also the first show he played where he was in complete control of both sound and visuals. Vast landscapes reminiscent of vintage computer or video game graphics poured onscreen behind him. An ominous theme of nature versus technology was set by images of iPads and iPhones being destroyed with knives and hammers.</p>\n<p>Still, I can’t say I didn’t miss the psychedelic, other-worldly feel so prominent in his album, and by the audience reaction it seemed as though they were yearning for it a bit too. I would definitely not say that what he played was unfavorable or not enjoyable by any means. But Everett’s set did fail in getting people to move and dance, which I assumed most people had come to do. In contrast, I thought the set was great for kicking back with friends in a more chilled-out environment. But then again, who is to say what objective purpose live music can or should serve?</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, noticeable tension built up between the artist and his audience, who seemed less than enthusiastic for the greater part of the night. The extensity of their movement was limited to knee bouncing and head bopping, and this lack of reaction, sure to frustrate any artist, was not lost on Everett.</p>\n<p>Before his performance, Everett turned to Instagram to express his frustrations with a video aptly titled “Modern crowds vs. forward-thinking music,” which showed the front few rows of people tapping their fingers and otherwise looking bored during the opener’s performance.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that this early experience set a cynical tone for the rest of Everett’s night. At one point he grabbed the microphone to give a “shout out to the girl turned completely the other way.” It seemed fair to say there was a strange feeling going around. Amidst it all, I couldn’t help but wonder who was more to blame here: the unresponsive and seemingly unappreciative crowd, or the DJ who was not delivering what they wanted? Perhaps both were a bit at fault for not putting in full energy and enthusiasm, or perhaps neither was at fault for simply being true to their tastes.</p>\n<p>Despite who should ultimately take the blame, Everett took the initiative about three quarters into the show. He stopped the music and again grabbed the microphone, but this time it wasn’t to throw shade. He took on a more remorseful tone this time and thanked everybody for buying tickets and coming out to support him.</p>\n<p>In a climactic moment of admittance, he proclaimed he was going to start playing some “newer shit, not three year old shit” and wanted to see everybody in the crowd, especially the front row, having fun.</p>\n<p>It was cool and refreshing to see him take that tone. His humble attitude was a far cry from the usually rigid stance of unwavering artistic integrity he puts forward on social media, and not something I would have expected. It verified that he felt the same vibes everyone else did that were going around and made up his mind to do something about it.</p>\n<p>I like to believe that any good live music experience depends on a generous flow of energy moving between the artist and the audience. Although something about XXYYXX’s concert started out a bit off, I was glad to see it come together in the end.
