This topic is very near and dear to my heart (as well as on top of it). From a young age, I have suffered an affliction which has affected my everyday life: massive knockers. I do not run; it is not plausible due to my fear of being hit in the face with them. People are perpetually throwing things at my cleavage like it’s some sort of goal. My bra doubles as a purse and sometimes I forget things in there. I can (and have) worn my bra as a full-on hat. Allow me to elaborate on the importance of this topic by sharing an anecdote.</p>\n<p>Last year, when I was but a young buck in the wild world of mixed gender relations, I decided to commit the cardinal sin of hookups: getting down with my hot neighbor. Oh, he was so pretty. Thick as a post, however, (mentally, that is) and constantly walking around with his mouth open. Once more, let me emphasize: I was young and naiive. So I was performing fellatio, and things were going moderately well when he decided to make his move. What he did startled and baffled me. Reaching down around me, he batted my breasts from side to side, like some sort of demented, sexually unaware cat. I stopped immediately, unable to focus when such blasphemous ministrations were occurring.</p>\n<p>“What … what are you doing?” I asked, lost.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“You like that, baby?” He asked, mouth agape.</p>\n<p>“No, stop it. Go for the nips, bro.” He did not. Instead, he chose to squeeze them very hard with a claw-like grip, all while looking at me with an eyebrow raised. Needless to say, I left shortly after.</p>\n<p>Now, class, can you tell me what my neighbor did wrong? Let me put it to you this way: Women are like unicorns. But instead of horns, we have boobs as our element of mysticism. Honor and righteously please the breasts. I know they’re very exciting, but don’t lose your cool. Every touch counts: Don’t dedicate two minutes (or in some cases an entire morning — you know who you are) to learning the physics of my breasts. Yes, if you lift them, they will fall back down, so operates gravity. I swear to God if one more guy pokes them after I am already blessedly undressed, I will break his finger. How would you respond if I were to bat your penis from side to side? “Ooh, it’s like one of those inflatable clown punching bags,” I would coo. “I hit it and it comes right back up!” Let me tell you now, its buoyancy would quickly deflate, much like my libido.</p>\n<p>Now that I’ve dumped a sufficient amount of exasperation on your shoulders, let’s get to the tips (of the nips, of course).</p>\n<p>The most important thing I’ve gathered from my own sexcapades and that of others is this: sensitivity. As a rule, women with smaller breasts are more sensitive, and women with larger breasts are less. This is because women with larger knockers have the nerves stretched out more, reducing sensation. It is very important to suss out your ladies’ level. Lightly scratch your nails over her whole breast, which is riddled with nerves. That feels rad. Take things slow with your mouth and hands, building them up until she is making those delightful sounds. Cup her tit and focus on the nipple, as that’s where almost all the sensitivity is. Trace the edges of the nipple with your tongue before taking it into your mouth, swirling, flicking and lightly nibbling. Just remember to do so lightly. It is always better to assume that she is very sensitive so that you don’t hurt her. Ladies, you are the key to your own pleasure. If you are less sensitive, like myself, tell him he can be rougher. I say, “I’m not very sensitive so don’t be afraid to get rough with me.” When given the go, bite, pinch, flick harder. Don’t bite her nipple off, just bite her the way you would like to be bitten.</p>\n<p>Just as women can derive pleasure from nipple stimulation, so can men. When you’re making out shirtless, give him a flirty little pinch. Swirl your tongue around it on your way South. However, do these things in passing. Treating them like female breasts is awkward. If they like it, it’s something you can toss in every once in awhile.</p>\n<p>While on the topic of chesticles, let me skim briefly over what I have recently learned about body piercings. Within a group of women I am affiliated with, there are not one, but seven girls who have their nipples pierced. Originally, the thought made me cringe: Why defame the glory given to you by nature? If our boobs are our unicorn horns, why would we want to whittle them into bizarre forms that are unappealing to many? Well, a) because they kind of look badass and b) they drastically increase your sensitivity. All of the girls who received this piercing reported that they could now orgasm from nipple stimulation. Needless to say, I was wowed. I thought such things were the myths of teenage boys and fan-fictions. At times, I ponder if there is a nipple piercing in my own future. Mayhaps. But if your booby nerves are particularly resilient like mine own, this is an option you may look into.</p>\n<p>Finally, remember that for most, chestal stimulation is nice. It is not extraordinary, but it is a good buildup for what’s to come. Don’t spend half an hour playing with her chest, because she will get bored. You may be motorboating the living hell out of her, but after a certain point she will be gazing listlessly over your head, waiting for you to wrap it up and get back on the agenda.</p>\n<p>And so, dear readers, remember this: Everyone loves boobs. Just make sure that you are loving them right. Go, frolic, have bloated post-Thanksgiving-gorging sex and, please, fondle properly. Happy Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. has a thing or (more accurately) two to teach you about how to keep your hands full.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49051\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/titty-patrol-laying-law-bosom-standards-practices/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49051\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/titty-patrol-laying-law-bosom-standards-practices/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/titty-patrol-laying-law-bosom-standards-practices/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/titty-patrol-laying-law-bosom-standards-practices/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/titty-patrol-laying-law-bosom-standards-practices/","id":6372,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6371,6370,6369],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Queen of the Hill: Tingling Tales of  Girl-On-Top","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Good day, my raunchy readers!

Today we will be pondering the complexities of girl-on-top. This entails subtopics such as where a male’s hands should be, the paramount importance of hip-guiding and the foolish insecurities of women. Let’s ride this topic out.</p>\n<p>Gentlemen, when it comes to girl-on-top, hand placement is a major factor in how well you will be graded. Your options are as follows: breasts, clit, hands or hips. Due to your prime real estate, you must take advantage of your free hands. Not using your hands is the equivalent of the “dead fish” female partner. Further elaborating upon the point of hips, hip-guiding falls into the realm of communication, and that’s important.</p>\n<p>When guiding the hips of a madam, you can control the speed, tempo and depth. Oftentimes girls assume that faster is better, but guys like going slow, too, so that they can better focus on the sensations building up. By guiding her, you can help her figure out just what you want. Many times girls might feel awkward because them controlling the motions are atypical, so more feedback makes them more comfortable with exploring this elevate realm. Plus, it’s freakin’ sexy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Hombres, if there is anything you take from this article, let it be this: never, ever, ever put your hands behind your head. I’ve stopped and traded in my friction for some slanderous diction. Others will abandon your love boat completely, preferring the treacherous seas of abstinence. It may be comfortable, but it makes you look like a D-bag.</p>\n<p>Another much appreciated effort: when you grab a girl’s wrists in both hands and put them over your head. G’damn. And ladies, feel free to pin him as well when on top. Everyone loves a little power struggle. Your dominion over his titillating territory/provocative province (oh, how I love alliteration) can be emphasized by eye contact. Eye contact is particularly sexy when you initiate it atop your fleshy throne. Just as chimpanzees will challenge one another via the medium of a sullen stare, you too assert your sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Personally, I feel like eye contact is a good move in sexual relations. It always surprises me when people say that they dislike eye contact due to the intensity of the intimacy it generates. Allow me to remind you that sex is an intimate act and despite however emotionally casual your relationship with a partner may be, you shouldn’t shy away from the increased sexual tension. Eye contact is a universal acknowledgement of the other person’s existence. So acknowledge the eff out of their sexual existence. Ladies, when in reverse cowgirl, toss him a smokey gaze over your shoulder all sexy-like. Maybe gape like a fish, I think guys are actually into that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>Speaking of reverse cowgirl, let’s talk about the scenic views of your grassy pastures. When in reverse, lean further towards his feet. It provides a deliciously vulgar view of him entering you that he will pause to appreciate. This is the best time to go nice and slow. If you lean even farther forward, he can sit up while propped against something. This variation provides good leverage, a delicious angle of your badonk sitting pretty on his lap.</p>\n<p>An additional variation that I’m very excited about (and you should all do this like it’s homework) is as follows: in reverse cowgirl, pull up one of his knees. Put your knees on either side and hold onto his knee to maneuver yourself up and down better. It’s especially yummy because you have friction on your privies from his thigh.</p>\n<p>Speaking of thighs, a problem a lot of women have is being insecure on top for superficial reasons, like the dimples on your thighs. Playa’ please, he’s not looking at the dimples. He’s focusing on your pretty face and ogling your bouncing bazoongas. That’s real talk.</p>\n<p>Finally, my darlings, end your copulation with what I like to call, “The Perfect Dismount.” This involves the man, once near, to toss his saucy lady off her seat, pouncing her hungrily and riding it out to the finish with fevered passion. Primal hunger should characterize the act. Wait, what am I saying? Primal hunger should characterize all parts of sex.</p>\n<p>Go, enjoy, frolic in each others bodies.

Now, I have qualms with both my XXs and my XYs regarding your respective oral habits, and this may result in being a bit of a rant. You could say I’m going to give this topic a righteous tongue-lashing. Let us begin.</p>\n<p>Ladies: You and I will be discussing the matter of swallowing, because, as we all know, ladies never spit. To my surprise, I’ve encountered many a female who divulged that, when facing the barrel of his gun, they turn their head to the onslaught, choosing instead to spit it out, or have them release their little soldiers into a napkin, mug, what have you. For shame! When I asked for their reasoning, the most common excuses I was given were that it was “icky” and “demoralizing.” Surprisingly, “icky taste” was significantly a better predictor of fluid rejection. Well, my response is thus: You’re already gobbling his pee stick, so don’t give me that bullshit. Commit. If you think it’s gnar or you feel shamed, then don’t partake in oral sex! It’s a world of unsavory things; you’re just getting your panties in a bunch about the last few seconds. Besides, you shouldn’t taste it. Why in God’s name would you? The trick is to swallow continuously from the moment he makes that “huurremmgn” sound to after he’s done convulsing. When his salty seas cascade against the shores of your uvula, do not sit and ponder his body tang! Choke it back like a true Gaucho! All those shots better have instilled some life skills!</p>\n<p>When discussing it with an associate to get the male perspective on the feminine denouncement of man juices, he stated that having a girl spit it out felt like a rejection. When they did finish the process, it was rewarding in that it felt like he was being accepted completely. This is very similar to the kissing phenomena I will discuss later on. Now, I’m sure overall, men are happy just to be able to stick their custard launchers in some girl’s orifices; they really can’t complain. But I can. Not only is the experience much cleaner, it is obviously sexier (you are excused, ladies, if you let him finish on your chest). I’ve heard girls say they spit it out in mugs. That is far gnarlier to me. I would never, ever, be able to use that mug again.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Gentlemen, you’re much worse. There are a few different topics we will be discussing in the realm of salivating on other’s genitals.</p>\n<p>Exhibit A: You never do it long enough. When discussing this article with my female friends, this point was unanimous. We take longer than you. As I previously mentioned, you better commit. Almost always, once you get bored you say something along the lines of “you good?” No. No, we are not good. We may say we are, but only because we don’t want to make you slave away in our vaginal concentration camps. It’s supposed to be a fun time, and if you make it clear you’re exasperated, that’s a turnoff. What if some chick was going down on you, pulled back, gave a deep, tired sigh and said, “You done yet?” Mmm, that’s arousing (…said no one, ever).</p>\n<p>Exhibit B: Dual action. You wonder why we don’t come when you’re spelling the alphabet down there with your tongue? It’s because you need to use your fingers too. It will significantly speed up the process, I promise you. Think of it this way, when we go down on you, we don’t do it with our hands in the air. We are grasping your leaky hose with our hands, stroking to add more to your pleasure experience. Well, that and because I have a phobia that it’s going to go up my nose … or in my eye … that’s a trauma I could do without. Anyway, use both.</p>\n<p>Exhibit C: Kisses, post-swallowing. If she heeds my advice and swallows her medicine, so help me, you better kiss her afterwards. If you don’t, you don’t deserve it. Nothing feels more like rejection when you don’t and nothing is as sexy when you do. It’s the gratification we get for our deed. I’ve had guys avoid the kiss and it really pisses me off; eventually I just don’t want to do it for him anymore. I’ve also had guys who, the second I’m done, flip me onto my back and ravish my mouth. That was rad and it got me stoked on hooking him up in the future.</p>\n<p>Okay, my smutty sweethearts, go do your homework. It’s Halloween! What better day to suck on someone’s treats? Just remember not to spit your candy out too soon or to reject the gooey center. Happy humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. takes her coffee black, no creamer in this gal’s mug.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48503\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/putting-oral-ladies-spit-gents-quit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48503\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/putting-oral-ladies-spit-gents-quit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/putting-oral-ladies-spit-gents-quit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/putting-oral-ladies-spit-gents-quit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/putting-oral-ladies-spit-gents-quit/","id":6371,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6370,6369,6368],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Let’s Play: Toys in the Bedroom","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Ladies and gentlemen, I come before you today a woman who enjoys indulging in her favorite adult toy when her roommates are gone.

Cock rings are very simple and require little effort on the part of the sir. Just stretch the ring around his deep-V diver and have it settle around the base. And voila! Now, have sex.</p>\n<p>Before I move on, a word of advice: Do not invest in the ones that go inside of you. It is certainly uncomfortable to have a small device inside of you already when your Casanova is insistent on stabbing it further in with his wang. Just mellow out with the basic version. You’ll get comfortable with the idea of vibrators, he’ll enjoy mixing it up, but it’s all still familiar.</p>\n<p>Once invested in a vibrator of a higher caliber, line up in naughty spoons and have him enter you from behind. Bring your top leg up so that your fleshy flower is exposed and he can have full access to it. The angle is tight for you both and there’s going to be clitoral stimulation up the yin-yang. He can then hold the vibrator to it as he goes for the gold from behind. The dual action feels crazy good and you can both get off. I suppose this position would work for both of you lying on top of him or doggy-style, but I feel you both can balance better and focus on the task at hand with a greater deal of precision.</p>\n<p>Recently I’ve been foraying into the world of kink and my hook-up buddy played this little gem out for me (more on that delicious topic later!) Standing up with your arms behind your back (good luck with that), he has the vibrator. What I like about this one is that it can work for either g-spot vibrators or ones that stimulate your clit. He holds it to your bits, rubbing it back and forth, in and out, what have you. The catch? You cannot reach your happy ending until he says so. You must ask him. If he’s naughty, he’ll take a few moments to ponder your request. Once given the okay, the desperation will give way to wicked awesomeness. You should do this close to a cushioned surface, as you will most likely fall over and eat shit otherwise, Jello-legs.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you are a guy and interested in how a vibrator would feel, that’s great. Why wouldn’t you want your junk to be electronically stimulated? We dig it, so why wouldn’t you? While I am fearful of referring to Cosmo’s suggestions, one in particular did seem safe and potentially enjoyable. Very simply, when she is going down on you, stick the vibrator to her cheek. The muted vibrations alongside her already righteous tongue lavishing should be pretty bomb.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, I leave you to fantasize about toys. Go forth, prosper and bask in all they have to offer. You should always be comfortable with your body.
