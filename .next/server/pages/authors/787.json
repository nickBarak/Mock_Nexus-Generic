I’m talking about </span><a href=\"https://animal-crossing.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animal Crossing </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and how it’s staked its claim as a cultural phenomenon of 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since shelter-in-place orders and social distancing regulations swept across the country, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/arts/gaming-introduction-basics-quarantine-coronavirus.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the video game industry has boomed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They’ve become a unique source of solace and remedy to the inevitable boredom of staying inside all day for long-time video game lovers and especially for the new and uninitiated. There’s something for everyone: sports-themed, thrill-fueled and family-oriented games are just several of the categories that have recently made their way into the mainstream. But there’s just one particular game that stands alone in its genius and holds a special place in my heart. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94658\" style=\"width: 357px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94658\" data-attachment-id=\"94658\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-29/the-season-of-animal-crossing/animal-crossing/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?fit=1535%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1535,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Animal crossing\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?fit=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-94658\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?resize=347%2C463\" alt=\"\" width=\"347\" height=\"463\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?w=1535&amp;ssl=1 1535w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?resize=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1 187w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?resize=768%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?resize=1151%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1151w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Animal-crossing.png?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-94658\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marcello Frisina / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n case you’ve been living under a rock since quarantine began, Animal Crossing is a lifestyle video game produced by Nintendo and originally released nearly twenty years ago by a Japanese game designer named </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuya_Eguchi\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katsuya Eguchi</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

There is none. There are no stakes, no time limits or stressful background music, no right or wrong way to play. You’re a villager who travels to islands meeting animals and other players with the freedom to decorate and expand your own village however you want.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has all the same principles and structural elements of any other lifestyle game, like the Sims or even FarmVille (RIP). But Animal Crossing has reached </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/tech/nintendo-switch-animal-crossing-quarantine/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">its special kind of monumental success</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a two-fold reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason is that it’s creators have mastered the </span><a href=\"https://mymodernmet.com/kawaii-art-japanese-culture/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kawaii aesthetic</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Animal Crossing’s  endearing graphics and overall satisfying gameplay. Nintendo has long been a revolutionary titan in the video game industry, and Animal Crossing is just one of its exceptional successes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second is timing. Quarantine has the world flipped upside down. Nothing makes sense, and nearly everyone and their mothers are coping with the newfound anxiety of doing simple tasks (like going to the grocery store and spending sleepless nights wondering if they have enough Lysol wipes). This is an unprecedented time. Living through something like this is unimaginable and difficult to completely wrap your head around at times. But Animal Crossing has proven to be the unexpected antidote to it all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The melody of a wind chime plays. Your friends are fishing, catching butterflies and hunting for fossils. There’s not a single care in the world. There are bonfires on the beach, coconuts in the trees and the sunsets are colored in dreamy pastels. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living through something like this is unimaginable and difficult to completely wrap your head around at times. But Animal Crossing has proven to be the unexpected antidote to it all.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animal Crossing today is what Bob Ross paintings were to the 80’s. Or maybe what Mr. Rogers was to the 70’s: singularly calming, serene and carefree. It’s the nonmedical treatment to the chaos that is our current cultural moment: a global pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first downloaded Pocket Camp, Animal Crossing’s smartphone app equivalent to the real game, I hoped it would cure my addiction to Solitaire and prove to be more interesting than Sudoku. Now, at Level 101 with a pimped-out campsite and tons of smartly dressed anthropomorphic friends, I think I can confidently say that I get the hype </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it’s real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve logged a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scary</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> amount of time on this app. When I say scary, I mean it’s too embarrassing to admit aloud. Let’s just say I’ve set alarms in the middle of the night to make sure my </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virtual</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> animal friends have enough lychee fruits and horned dynastids. I don’t even know what a dynastid is, but you can bet I’ll be tapping my phone like a psychopath at three in the morning to catch them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stigma around “gamers” is real, though. But the judgment that used to plague the idea of spending hours staring at a screen seems to be temporarily lifted thanks to the quarantine. There’s only so many Alexis Ren ab workouts I can attempt and whipped coffee one can make in a day. I’m on TikTok, applying to summer jobs on Handshake and becoming a real Martha Stewart in the kitchen, but nothing feels more satisfying or relaxing than playing Animal Crossing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pocket Camp is a judgement-free, Zoom-free, CNN-free zone. I don’t have to listen to the daily litany of lies our president rants about, I don’t have to read about the rise of death tolls without an end in sight, and I don’t feel guilty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quarantine is a uniquely strange time to begin new things, like learn a hobby, level up on Duolingo, save your GPA, go on virtual Bumble dates and an endless amount of self-care. But, most importantly, it’s a time to stop thinking that the things that give you pleasure are indulgent and unproductive. No one that’s alive has ever lived through anything like this. So use this time the way you want to, do the things that make you genuinely happy and add me on Animal Crossing. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pei Ja Anderson wants you to remember to have compassion for yourself.

Today, trendiness is no longer measured by the number of likes on your avocado toast pictures and hyper-posed selfies but instead by the relatability of your content. Realism has replaced aspiration. Recently, sites like Instagram and Pornhub champion content creators who’ve managed to perfect this amateur aesthetic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through ad revenue, brand deals and sponsorships, “influencing” has established itself beyond Gen Z speak, garnering attention as a legitimate — and highly lucrative — career. These revenue streams exist not only on YouTube, Instagram and other social media giants but in adult entertainment as well. Being an influencer is equal to being a modern-day entrepreneur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undeniably, one of the titans in the new wave of mainstream pornography is Pornhub. Conservative estimates value the the porn industry at </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/16/mia-khalifa-is-among-worlds-most-watched-women-yet-porn-industry-is-keeping-profits/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">around $2 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, due in part to porn’s stigma and the secretiveness surrounding the industry. Less conservative estimates stipulate that porn generates more annual revenue than both the NFL and Netflix. With these monster profits, the porn industry directs the spotlight toward pornography’s creators, who are no longer puppeted by major corporations and studios. Instead, business is created and managed by the film stars themselves. This shift in the porn business model has enabled anyone to become an adult-film star overnight.

People not only watch porn but feel just as invested in the lives of amateur porn stars as they do with their favorite influencers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Pornhub celebrated the 10th anniversary of their </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtissilver/2018/11/20/pornhubs-model-program-has-paid-out-millions-defining-a-new-type-of-influencer/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Model Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which hosts over a hundred thousand amateurs on their site. </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/islasummer_?lang=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Summer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is just one of them. The account is run by a young, college-aged couple in the Isla Vista community. After creating their account and posting their first video over spring break this past school year, they’ve become a household name among the community, with their content having been featured on Pornhub’s home page multiple times. To date, their account has received 20.2 million views and counting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Summer’s popularity is due to the recent demand for amateur porn coupled with their ability to strategize as influencers: They’re curating content that their audience wants to see. Summer, who wishes to remain anonymous, explained that “most of them are very absurd concepts and simple, easy-to-follow but absurd storylines,” because “it just catches the eye when you see that type of title online. You just have to click it.” They added that their “most popular video is where me playing 2K is the main focus of it.” The brand they’ve created — young, attractive and, most importantly, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> college students — is not the only reason they’ve been hugely successful; it’s also because they are aware of their brand and viewership and have utilized the amateur aesthetic to their advantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Featuring shots of the UCSB Library and local places in Santa Barbara, their content is starkly different from the manufactured look of a studio-produced film. </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444810362853\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the meaning of amateurism in porn, Susanna Paasonen discusses why amateur work’s higher sense of realism is attractive to consumers. It’s because amateurism is about mimicking reality: it’s truthful. While the ring lights of a professional studio and glamorous facades used to dominate the porn industry, it’s now all about the opposite. People want to see representations of sexual acts as truthful and authentic — the imperfect bodies and blemishes that make it feel, as one consumer of porn puts it, “like you’re in that setting or you’re that person.” This increased interest in involving the audience is the most crucial aspect of creating content that is both real and relatable, and above all, what young audiences want to see — whether it comes to amateur pornography or Instagram models. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being unfiltered is the new status quo. As Summer puts it: “People expect our lives to be, like, wildly different now, because they view us as porn stars but we’re exactly the same.” It’s this sameness that has launched them into fame. It is this transparency, in a clandestine industry, that blurs the lines between consumer and creator, average joe and porn star, which has established amateurism as culturally significant.<br>\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increased interest in involving the audience is the most crucial aspect of creating content that is both real and relatable, and above all, what young audiences want to see — whether it comes to amateur pornography or Instagram models. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monetary value of relatability is mirrored in other influencer industries. Take Emma Chamberlain, an 18-year old high school dropout turned multimillionaire business mogul. Her minimalistic, carefree aesthetic sets her apart from the hyper-produced, staged look that is popular among big YouTubers like Jake Paul and Bethany Mota. With 8.53 million YouTube subscribers in just under two years, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and record-setting rise to fame are evidence of how the pendulum of popularity has drastically swung in relability’s favor. Her editing style, filled with frequent jump cuts and superzooms, reflects the “quirky girl” personality that has earned her millions of followers. Her content production’s lack of professionalism and willingness to embrace her suburban American roots are qualities with which fans clearly engage and relate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On social media, Chamberlain frequently pokes fun at herself. Her fans say, “Unlike those other YouTubers living in mansions with perfect hair and expensive clothes, she’s just an average teen.” Identically, Isla Summer’s “average teen-ness” is a huge point of profit. More and more, it seems, the value and impact of an influencer can be measured by how accessible they are to their audience. The commodity is no longer the aspirational value; it is the personality, and most importantly, the person or people behind the camera. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim Kardashian and her family may be the best example of this. Her sex tape — the trailer, a six-minute preview leaked in 2007 — still holds its title as </span><a href=\"https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2018-year-in-review\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pornhub’s most watched video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of all time. It is undeniable that her rise to fame and multibillion dollar empire and influencer career stemmed from the film’s release. Whether it was leaked or not — which is still widely debated — the Kardashian family revolutionized the idea of the celebrity, capitalizing on the transition from the public to private sphere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to Kardashian, the idea of a celebrity was no longer an untouchable, aspirational figure, seen on Photoshopped magazine covers and commercials, but a personalized, profitable brand that highlighted the creator’s relatability. The influencers of today owe it to the Kardashians for creating an industry career out of thin air. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just feel like I’m hanging out with my friends. My camera is my friend,” said </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiM8OI8ySYAoealLy-YRCbg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summer McKeen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of Chamberlain’s friends and an influencer in her own right. At the heart of influencing is the connection with a fanbase that pays for the glorified influencer’s career and lifestyle under the guise of realism, as if you too can be friends with Kim — only after paying for her new contour palette. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The popularity of realism in porn, it seems, is not an isolated event: The culture has shifted, the tide has changed and content creators like Chamberlain and Isla Summer are leaders of this creative counterculture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily vlogs, “day in the life”-style videos that are popular on YouTube, can be viewed as parallel to Pornhub’s Model Program, which has the same objective: increase the consumer’s access to the creator. </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/double3xposure/?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reese Blutstein</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a 22-year-old influencer with a quarter of a million followers, puts it simply: “For my generation, people are more willing to be who they are and not make up a fake identity,” she said. “We are trying to show a real person doing cool things as a real person, not trying to create a persona that isn’t actually you.” This candidness and creator-to-consumer relationship is then monetized for profit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of Pornhub’s Model Program, creators like Isla Summer can offer exclusive, customizable video and photo content, as well as profit from private conversations and texting via Snapchat. This direct-to-consumer distribution method is the reason why Summer said, “In terms of the ad revenue perspective, you get taken care of pretty well being on one of the biggest websites in the world.” It’s all about “trying to get as many eyeballs to see your link as possible, because the more people that click your link, the more advertisers want to use your link to put up their ads.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The couple went into further detail regarding the ease with which they started their career on Pornhub, saying, “It was so easy. Literally, all we had to do was send them pictures of our IDs and a couple of pictures to verify that we were actually in possession of this account.” Making porn, to Isla Summer, was not with the intention of becoming the next Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee. It was about earning an income, as is the objective of nearly all other content creators. The stigma surrounding porn wasn’t evident at all in Isla Summer’s comments or demeanor. As content creators, the sexual element is removed from their titles, with their focus devoted to reaping the benefits of the cash cow that is amateur porn. “Until the internet as we know it dies, this is gonna keep making us more and more money, so we’re just going to try to keep doing what we’re doing,” Summer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overlaps between mainstream influencer culture and amateur pornography are becoming more and more frequent. In the premier of the new season of the YouTube show “</span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-reality-house-show-trisha-paytas-elijah-daniel-contestants-2019-7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reality House</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” a reality competition show in the same vein as “Big Brother,” </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/KianAndJc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian and Jc</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two big names in the YouTube world, welcomed internet personality and amateur pornstar </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEFuuAUSHlQzHMres7AD38Q\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lena The Plug</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into the new cast. Lena The Plug was also nominated for Top Celebrity at the</span><a href=\"https://www.pornhub.com/awards/nominees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2019 Pornhub Awards</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, along with </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClWD8su9Sk6GzZDwy9zs3_w\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tana Mongeau</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cardi B, Kim Kardashian and Stormy Daniels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the technological revolution came the graduation of porn from magazines and VCRs to our phones, just a finger tap away. Today, porn occupies the public, private and even political domain. However the monetization of realism, while economically lucrative and seemingly innocent, is concerning. Without being critical of our content, it’s easy to be unable to decipher when a photo or video has gone through rounds of editing or seen the desks of producers and managers when it’s posed — and branded — as organic. The amateur aesthetic is dangerous in deceiving its audiences and arguably equally as dangerous as the blatant Photoshop fails and hyper-edited magazine covers. Where professionalism connotes skill and quality, amateurism embodies spontaneity and truthfulness. However, both are representations of reality that have been deliberately manufactured. Who’s to say what lies underneath the facade of an #unfiltered post? Regardless, what is not up for debate is the cultural impact of the amateur. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pei Ja Anderson supports YouTube influencers, amateur porn stars and Instagram baddies everywhere. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b07cd1f42eb556b5b4d03ef08fe63e16?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b07cd1f42eb556b5b4d03ef08fe63e16?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/pei-ja-anderson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Pei Ja Anderson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Pei Ja Anderson is an opinion staff writer. She loves fighting the patriarchy as much as she loves bagel bites.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:peijaanderson@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91888\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/local-porn-stars-rise-to-fame-by-keeping-it-real/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91888\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/local-porn-stars-rise-to-fame-by-keeping-it-real/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/local-porn-stars-rise-to-fame-by-keeping-it-real/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/local-porn-stars-rise-to-fame-by-keeping-it-real/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/local-porn-stars-rise-to-fame-by-keeping-it-real/","id":5632,"author":{"id":787,"name":"Pei Ja Anderson"},"related":[5631,5630,5629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Fault in Our Star Signs","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Virtual Reality","publish_date":"2019-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zodiac.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zodiac.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Does astrology have all the answers?

From </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/books/astro-poets-twitter.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter accounts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dedicated to posting daily horoscopes with half a million followers to </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drunkstrology/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pages that relate the signs to viral memes, astrology has long since graduated from the back pages of printed newspapers and taken on a life — and cult following — of its own. From Urban Outfitters graphic tees to dating apps, it has infiltrated nearly all domains of social life — I recently came across a Tinder bio that read, “Add me on Co-Star.” It seems as though the astrology obsession has become a cultural norm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the initial weeks after I downloaded the app, I let the daily horoscope notifications pile up. I dismissed them as corny platitudes (“Drastic times call for drastic measures” or “You can give them a chance today”) and eventually let them get lost in the mix of breaking news headlines and Facebook event notifications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then suddenly, the stars aligned and my horoscope started to get it absolutely right — almost disturbingly so. On the day Co-Star sent me, “If you want people to communicate with your heart, you have to teach them the language it speaks in,” my sister and I had just resolved a week-long fight. When I received, “It’s time to grow past your fundamental injuries from when your primary caregivers failed to understand you,” it reminded me to stop wallowing and pull my head out of my ass. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instantly, I was hooked. I gave myself to the trusting hands of the cosmos. Doubts of “this is literally just a company who pays people to write these” and “it’s all about perception” got squashed by the immediate rush of validation and satisfaction I got from reading and confirming for the first time what a true Sagittarius I apparently was: headstrong, stubborn and spontaneous to a fault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to live for the eerie sense that an inanimate entity (a fucking app) knew me better than I knew myself. That I didn’t need unique passions or interests because everybody seemed to already have their own ideas of who a Sagittarius was. It was more comforting than I cared to admit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day, I would screenshot my horoscope and send it my friends, exclaiming, “That’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> me!” while hundreds of thousands of other Co-Star users did the same thing, claiming the generic platitude as their own. Still, it would give me an extra boost of confidence that would stay with me throughout the day.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to live for the eerie sense that an inanimate entity (a fucking app) knew me better than I knew myself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-Star allows you to lean into a list of traits that the Internet says makes you a “total Virgo” and base your identity, quirks and strengths on a personality that has already been curated for you. For a time, it made being 20 seem simple. These accurate (or what coincidentally happened to be accurate) horoscopes gave me a sense of control over my life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Astrology provided security because it was a way of creating order in an orderless world. It asserts itself as a philosophy without room for doubt and provides a self-assured confidence that is extremely attractive. The 12 sun signs — based on birth month — are taken not as suggestions or fortunes, but as permanent and reliable fixtures in our society, each with their own set of “individualized” principles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stopped being a die-hard believer in astrology when I started to notice discrepancies between myself and what my sign was supposed to be. </span><a href=\"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/zodiac-signs/sagittarius/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sagittariuses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are generous, idealistic, extroverted, cursed with an insatiable case of wanderlust and truth-seeking. They are “independent and strong-willed,” “natural born leaders,” “seductive” and “trailblazing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are wildly broad claims that feel more descriptive of a video game character than a real person. I don’t know anyone, let alone myself, who embodies </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of these statements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s a defense for these blanket statements: the generalized qualities of the sun signs only scratch the surface of astrology. Apparently, your moon sign explains it all. And to figure out your moon sign you need to know what time you were born.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know what time I was born because I’m adopted, so I tried to deduce my moon sign by process of elimination. Each day, I read the horoscopes of all the moon signs and took note on which felt the most accurate. By the end of my two-week trial, 168 horoscopes later, I came to the conclusion that a Gemini moon seemed a likely fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of this pseudo-experiment, I discovered I still had the same nagging feeling of incompleteness that I had when I first started. I didn’t feel a loyalty to any of the signs and was even beginning to doubt whether my Sagittarius-ness held any value. The fact that a Leo moon tended to gravitate to the spotlight more than a Cancer felt like arbitrary information, even silly. I didn’t possess the authority to claim I belonged to one over the other because I still didn’t have anything to prove it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d spent too much of my time and energy in the world of astrology to come out feeling just as confused as I had at the beginning. It felt like I was promised clarity on the condition that I figured out my birth time, and only then would I be able to access this wealth of knowledge about myself. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Astrology provided security because it was a way of creating order in an orderless world.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A part of me knew that it wouldn’t have mattered anyway. This piece of myself I’d attached so much value to and made myself feel guilty for not knowing was trivial. What was more revealing than anything was how far I had let myself spiral into an astrology obsession. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My faith was based on insecurity. I wanted (and still want) to fast-forward through my bumbling 20s and college years to this fully developed version of myself that doesn’t exist. I wanted it to be as easy as picking an avatar in a game, complete with attractive, likeable traits I didn’t have to work for or even think about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought I could use astrology as a cure-all for my doubts and anxieties about the future. For reconciling the contradictions in my personality, justifying habits of self-sabotage, for not feeling like I was not 100% any one quality. Surely one day I would develop into the full-blown Sagittarius I was if I just believed a little more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe me, I tried. I based entire relationships on whether our signs were compatible or not. Even worse, I judged other people for not believing in it too, this dogma based on fear and escapism posing as cute personality traits and trendy finger tattoos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of this summer, I realized I was cheating myself. I had avoided engaging and actually thinking about my choices and beliefs for an embarrassingly long time. Where I had once felt confident claiming all the ways I was “such a Sagittarius,” this persona began to feel meaningless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I did see clearly was how quickly I blindly attached myself to this belief in astrology. It was something to grasp onto, something that promised answers and truths that I became convinced I would never find without it. It assuaged feelings of self-doubt and social anxiety. I was learning to love the provided answers; I was learning to love not being me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little by little, I am learning how to relinquish my grip on astrology. </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-new-age-of-astrology/550034/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff astrologer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/broadly\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broadly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Annabel Gat, puts it simply: “It’s a tool for self-reflection, it’s not a religion or a science. It’s just a way to look at the world and a way to think about things.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realize that for most people, astrology doesn’t evolve into this type of unhealthy obsession and codependency. But I do question the underlying and often subconscious motivations of its young target audience.

No, they’re not religious. Yes, my sister is also white. No, I don’t even speak a word of the language. My parents are not my saviors. I am not their token Asian brainiac. We are your average family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, I am a Chinese immigrant. But my mother and father were born and raised in the suburbs of Illinois. My parents have never faced language barriers, filled out immigration forms or sacrificed the comforts and culture of their native country. My dad made salmon and asparagus for dinner, and my mom and I went out to eat at our favorite burrito dive. I was raised in a family that religiously watched the Super Bowl every year and ate Belgian waffles at the farmer’s market on Sundays. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve never had a close Asian friend. I grew up in a white family in a predominantly white community and attended a private high school. I was one of the only “yellow” faces on campus. I don’t speak a lick of Chinese and was enrolled in Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course I didn’t go about my life purposefully avoiding Asian people and consciously isolating myself. There was no reason I didn’t have friends who identified as Asian. There was just no reason to pluck people out of my community who were Asian and force them to be my friend, to racially profile and try to force myself into a community in which I have never felt welcome or sought out to be included. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to my former Chinese roommate, I am a “banana”: “yellow” on the outside, white on the inside. An Asian shell covering a mushy white interior. I was offended at first. Yes, the color analogy to define racial appearances is harmful, but there was a grain of truth in my “banana”-ness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A “banana.” This term is white-washed. An exclusionary and divisive ideology that dictates who’s Asian and who’s just, well, faking it. A “banana” wears Rainbow flip-flops and doesn’t speak the language of their home country. But why is the authenticity of Asian-ness questioned and compared? Why is my roommate who speaks Chinese, reads Korean and is on the board of the Korean American Student Association (KASA) more Asian than me?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have denied my “banana” status for as long as I can remember. I ticked off the “Asian/Pacific Islander” box on every form and questionnaire. I was president of my high school’s Asian Student Union club. I attempted to learn Mandarin on Duolingo (I never passed Level 1). I played classical piano and proudly identified as a person of color.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is my roommate who speaks Chinese, reads Korean and is on the board of the Korean American Student Association (KASA) more Asian than me?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But my identity was thrown into question when I accompanied my friend to the UCSB Chinese New Year celebration in the Loma Pelona Center in February. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red streamers draped from the ceiling and gold-lettered posters distracted from the usual recreational feel of the space. Circular tables were occupied by students and faculty I had never met or seen before. The fluorescent lights dimmed and my friend and I watched dance performances, songs and short clips of students in Chinese 5. The room vibrated with applause after each performance, friends cheering for their friends, performers giggling in embarrassment, supporting this display of what I finally realized was an authentic Chinese celebration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point, the Chinese professor of the friend who brought me approached us with a warm smile, excited that my friend had included me. The professor looked at me and immediately began to speak in Chinese. My face fell flat. I was outed: the “banana” of the bunch. My mushy white interior was revealed from head to toe, from my scrunched, confused eyebrows to the Birkenstocks on my feet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food from Madame Lu, a restaurant downtown, was brought in and served buffet-style at the end of the room. My friend and I stood apart from the crowd, people-watching and eating when we saw my former roommate from last year, the “banana” accuser. I use the word “accuser” with the lightest and most satirical tone, as she is one of my favorite people on this campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having lived apart this year, it dawned on me that I missed our conversations about Chinese culture: me, humming the tune of songs that were in the performances and her, translating as best she could to find them on Spotify. Our conversations were mostly normal chit-chat, but I always walked away feeling like I gained a little piece of the lost culture I didn’t realize I had always yearned for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I left the LPC that night, chowing down on food whose names I couldn’t pronounce, I stopped being in denial and accepted my “banana”-ness. It wasn’t a derogatory term. It didn’t make me less of a person. I was an Asian-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These dual identities no longer existed in contradiction with one another; I was no longer in conflict with myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passing by Davidson Library, hearing the chatter of languages I can’t understand from the mouths of people who look like me but have life experiences and a security in their cultural identity that I will never know, I’ve begun to distance myself from the technicalities and physical appearance that superficially dictate my race.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a “banana” divided my exterior and interior into a dichotomy I refuse to engage with anymore.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the Asian communities and spaces on UCSB’s campus — KASA, the Taiwanese American Student Association (TASA), the Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) and multicultural Asian sororities — the limit to which I belong to the Asian community is finally revealed to me. While we share a similar exterior, my “banana” identity sets me apart. Beyond the surface of every individual is a deeper and complex manifestation of quirks and strengths, flaws and contradictions.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These limits were important to accept. Difficult because of the years I spent in denial, but integral to my understanding of what Asian-American identity is. I used to measure my self-worth by how confident I felt identifying with each culture and was constantly concerned with simultaneously being authentically Asian </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> authentically American. I pulled apart these identities from the hyphen that bonds them but never felt that I had succeeded in wholly being either person. Assigning value to my Asian and American traits was a fool’s errand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling me a “banana” isn’t accurate enough. Being a “banana” divided my exterior and interior into a dichotomy I refuse to engage with anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the root of my uncertainty was shame.
