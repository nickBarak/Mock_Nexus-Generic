For so many Democrats, myself included, Sanders was a light in the dark tunnel in which we have been living  for the past four years. His policy proposals were progressive and considerate of the less fortunate in our country. Having ended his campaign, the Democratic National Committee’s presidential bid will go to his last standing opponent: Joe Biden. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94088\" style=\"width: 1289px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94088\" data-attachment-id=\"94088\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-29/biden-or-bust/closebestbiden/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/closebestbiden.png?fit=1279%2C689&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1279,689\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"closebestbiden\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/closebestbiden.png?fit=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/closebestbiden.png?fit=888%2C479&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94088\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/closebestbiden.png?resize=888%2C478\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/closebestbiden.png?w=1279&amp;ssl=1 1279w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/closebestbiden.png?resize=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/closebestbiden.png?resize=1024%2C552&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/closebestbiden.png?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-94088\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Celine Khuu / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change in course feels highly akin to the results of the 2016 race for the Democratic primary. When Sanders ended his campaign, it was unlikely that he could have taken the nomination, being that he was so far behind Biden in the vote count. Sanders has maintained similar stances through both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, which many considered far too “radical.” Undoubtedly, many Democrats were fearful that in the general election, voters would be hesitant to embrace his ideas. On the other hand, Biden, like Hillary Clinton in 2016, is a far more moderate candidate, making him an appealing choice for a wider range of voters and the Democratic National Committee itself. Consequently, some Sanders supporters are reluctant to grant their vote to Biden. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders’ demographic is primarily young people, many of whom have taken to the internet to express their frustration in the wake of his decision. They have coined the phrase “Bernie or Bust” to express their refusal to vote for Biden in the general presidential election. Some of these supporters have stated that they will not be voting in the election at all, or that they will be writing Sanders on the ballot instead.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as I stand for Sanders’ positions, this is an irresponsible use of one’s right to vote. Once again, we find ourselves set to watch a battle between two nonoptimal old white men. The position we have been put in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> forced to choose the lesser of two evils </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is far from ideal. Nevertheless, this </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the reality we find ourselves in, and we must use our votes wisely despite the circumstances.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us may wonder what the effect of our vote even is, since we live in the blue state of California. This is not a swing state, and because of the electoral college, it can be assumed that California will go to whoever the Democratic nominee is. However, your vote is still needed. Safe states haven’t always been safe states: The position of the state either changes or stays the same through the votes of individuals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2016 election, we saw a battle between the popular vote and the electoral college. The people chose Clinton, and the system chose Donald Trump. This is definitely a testament to the corruption inherent in our system. Without the quantity of individual voters, this corruption wouldn’t have been exposed. More so, if you don’t go to the polls in November, your vote for local positions and propositions will also go unconsidered. If anything, you should feel a stronger desire to vote in local elections, as the outcome of these elections will impact you more directly. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Biden doesn’t hold the same policy views as Sanders, let’s have a look at how they compare to Trump’s.  </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Sanders’ announcement, Biden took to the stage and addressed Sanders supporters. </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/bernie-sanders-drops-out.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He assured us,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country.” This may seem unconvincing to many of us, but Sanders himself has </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-endorsement.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">endorsed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his former competitor. In a joint livestream appearance, he said to Biden, “We need you in the White House. And I will do all that I can to see that that happens.” Following Sanders’ endorsement came the endorsements of former President Barack Obama and previous candidate Elizabeth Warren. The fact that these figures have turned their support toward Biden enhances the importance of our support to Biden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This being said, I find a “blue no matter who” mindset to be an ignorant one. There is much more to consider about a candidate than simply the political party they identify with. It is important to research candidates and be clear about their stance on different issues. Just because someone identifies with a certain party doesn’t mean that their views or voting record align with said party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what I</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want to stress is the importance of your vote. A vote for Biden is not only that, but it is also a vote against Trump. Many of us believe that Trump’s position in the White House has been a major step in the wrong direction for our country. Sanders’ proposals of Medicare for All, cancellation of college debt and the Green New Deal gave us hope for the future. We must continue to fight for these progressive causes. While Biden doesn’t hold the same policy views as Sanders, let’s have a look at how they compare to Trump’s. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biden’s campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> prioritizes healthcare, environmental issues and the economy. He proposes to protect the Affordable Care Act and lower the age of eligibility for Medicare. As for the environmental crisis, Biden promises that he will lead our country toward net-zero emissions by 2050. Biden favors an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and an overall strengthening of support for the middle working class. Comparatively, </span><a href=\"https://www.promiseskept.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been working to repeal Obamacare, leading to an increasing number of uninsured Americans. He has pulled our country out of the Paris Climate Agreement, with the intent to continue drilling and rescind the Clean Power Plan. Trump has decreased unemployment, which still stands high, but tax cuts for the upper class have affected the country elsewhere </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for example, bringing about the increase in uninsured Americans. Trump has prioritized the 1%. Biden’s policies are not as progressive as Sanders’. They are, however, monumentally better than Trump’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We needn’t give up on the things that Sanders promised us; we can continue to strive for the implementation of those policies. Biden gives us the best possible chance for these desired changes to come to fruition. As we move closer to the November election, I ask you to take this into consideration. Your right to vote is one of the privileges of living in a democratic society. Use it wisely. It’s Biden or Bust. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Lovell implores you to consider the importance of your vote. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sophialovell/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4750.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sophialovell/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sophia Lovell</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sophia Lovell is an opinion staff writer and photographer for the Nexus.  She runs off of cold brew and Rosarito’s breakfast burritos.</span></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sophialovell@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-29/biden-or-bust/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-29/biden-or-bust/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-29/biden-or-bust/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-29/biden-or-bust/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-29/biden-or-bust/","id":6481,"author":{"id":809,"name":"Sophia Lovell"},"related":[6480,6479,6478],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Living in Ambiguity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Hyphenated American","publish_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiracial1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiracial1.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sophia Lovell explores the difficulties of defining your cultural identity when you come from a mixed race background.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I guess I just assumed that you were Mexican,” is a line that I have heard far too many times.

Society has taught us to break physical features up into racial categories, to see certain eye shapes as “Asian” or hair textures as “Black.” Relying on stereotypes can make it difficult to see beyond black and white views of race — no pun intended. However, this can be detrimental to mixed-race individuals’ journeys to healthy self-identification. Society teaches us to rely on the validation of others, which is difficult for multiracial children when no one is able to affirm your race.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These standards warp a person’s sense of self. As a little kid, I would always raise my hand when taking a test that began with a survey asking for your race. “What should I put? It says choose one but I’m half-and-half.” I used to switch off between Caucasian (white, European, or Middle Eastern) and Asian/Pacific Islander. It felt like choosing between parents. At such an impressionable young age, I couldn’t even understand my racial identity and yet I was expected to be able to define myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, these questionnaires have added either the “Two or more races” category, or simply, “Other,” allowing for greater inclusion of interracial people. Except it is degrading to simply be marked as “Other,” as if to remind us that we don’t belong. Furthermore, this “otherhood” lumps  all multiracial people into one category. Multiracial people are often grouped together as one despite the word’s diverse connotations.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What should I put? It says choose one but I’m half-and-half.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be hard to find affirmation within the very cultures that we belong to. I find myself jealous of my monoracial peers who are able to easily experience their rich cultural identities. I am constantly the whitest Asian person, or the most Asian white person in the room. I feel little association with either grouping, and therefore it sometimes feels as if not being “racially pure” removes what little association I do have. I remember being dressed in a kimono for the first time in a small store in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. My sister and I were treated like tourists until my mom appeared, confirming our identities as Japanese children. Instantly we were given greater kimono options and guidance on what obis to pair with them. People in my life constantly remind me that I am not fully white, though they do so with the intention of being complimentary. My generation often associates white people with negative connotations. Whenever someone deems the entire white community as racist, ignorant or otherwise dishonorable, I am always assured by my peers that this does not include me due to my Japanese culture. Even though they say this with good intentions, it feels strange to me, as if I should be embarrassed to be white, as though I was given a choice in the matter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there are beautiful things that come with being multiracial. Growing up this way makes you more adaptable to the surrounding world. Mutliracial people are able to use the racism they have endured themselves to understand and advocate for others. Being both white and Japanese gives me a distinctive outlook on the world. I think that even the fact that my parents made the rebellious choice to marry outside their respective races and have children gives me an interesting history. My ancestors came from opposite sides of the world; my existence is proof of how connected we as humans can truly be. If each of my parents could accept an individual from an entirely different background, why can’t the rest of us? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has taken me a long time to feel comfortable and happy with both sides of my cultural identity: to claim both the stories of my maternal grandfather’s internment at the age of 12, and also the stories of my great-great-grandfather driving his family across the country after the Dust Bowl at the age of 12. Although I have always been aware that I am not defined solely by my race, we live in a society where race is simply unforgettable. When we, as mixed individuals, claim our racial backgrounds, we can show the rest of the world who buys into stereotypes that there is more to a person than what meets the eye.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Lovell challenges you to embrace your culture while daring to defy racial stereotypes. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sophialovell/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4750.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sophialovell/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sophia Lovell</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sophia Lovell is an opinion staff writer and photographer for the Nexus.  She runs off of cold brew and Rosarito’s breakfast burritos.</span></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sophialovell@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91512\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-25/living-in-ambiguity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91512\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-25/living-in-ambiguity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-25/living-in-ambiguity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-25/living-in-ambiguity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-25/living-in-ambiguity/","id":5658,"author":{"id":809,"name":"Sophia Lovell"},"related":[5657,5656,5655],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/809"}},"__N_SSG":true}
